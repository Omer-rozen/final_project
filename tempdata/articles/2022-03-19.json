France have been building towards this grand slam ever since the last World Cup, when their current coach, Fabien Galthi\u00e9, was already in place, deputy and heir apparent, to his predecessor, Jacques Brunel. In the years since, Galthi\u00e9 and his boss, Bernard Laporte, have turned France\u2019s run at the World Cup they host next year into a national project. They haven\u2019t just put together a team of coaches and a squad of players, but they have pulled in the Top 14 clubs and the French fans, too. There\u2019s a sense that everyone\u2019s pulling in the same direction.</p> \n<p>So Galthi\u00e9\u2019s team have been three years in the making. Jones\u2019s, on the other hand, feels like they have barely had three weeks. Somehow they are still starting out all over. That\u2019s Jones\u2019s choice, as he chops and drops and changes his backroom staff, his training squad and his match-day 23, while he tries to work out exactly what \u201cnew England\u201d looks like. He keeps talking about how they are steps forward, but it\u2019s beginning to feel as if they are standing still. He was at it again on Saturday night. \u201cWe\u2019re moving in the right direction,\u201d Jones said, \u201cwe\u2019re not far away.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e93d63dc-df7a-411c-9e73-58a6086187f0\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P5S2jm-P6dY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>They are.

For all their effort, they didn\u2019t once make it into the French 22 in those first 40 minutes and were fortunate that they were only 18-6 down at the break. Their play all felt over-engineered, dependent on training-ground ploys such as having Ellis Genge truck the ball up from deep, or Marcus Smith kick it crossfield.</p> \n<p>It was as if they were playing to a formula they had concocted during the week and decided to stick with it even though it wasn\u2019t working for them. And the trouble was, in the time it took them to change it up, France had all but gone and won the game. They\u2019ve never once been behind at half-time in any of 26 Tests they\u2019ve played since Galthi\u00e9 became head coach.

      "body": "<p>Since it opened in 2007, the small Sydney jazz club 505 has become an institution. The kind of place elite international musicians such as Chris Dave and Charlie Watts might \u201cdrop in\u201d just to see what\u2019s happening, and where a whole generation of musicians \u2013 including Ngaiire and Sirens Big Band \u2013 cut their teeth, playing to an audience that\u2019s more likely to cheer loudly or yell curses than give the expected polite finger snaps.</p> <p>The venue has moved across three premises in its lifetime, but to enter any feels like walking into an unusually spacious and well-decorated sharehouse living room \u2013 paying homage, perhaps, to how it began, as a weekly \u201cboard games and jazz\u201d night in a Surry Hills rental. The furniture is a jumble \u2013 new, antique, well-loved \u2013 with humble staging and PA, and a piano that bears the signatures of musicians that have breathed life into it. Perch on one of 505\u2019s rickety stools and you\u2019ll be so close to the performers you can see spit and woodchips flying across the stage.</p> <p>And on Friday night, the 5 Eliza Street venue became the latest casualty of Sydney\u2019s music scene, leaving the way it entered: with no ceremony, good company and world class music.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e7ccd8417b224dcd9140e70cadbc8e51aa04a68f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7ccd8417b224dcd9140e70cadbc8e51aa04a68f/0_0_8192_5464/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The old 505 theatre sign\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">505 left the way it entered: with no ceremony, good company and world class music.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the skies above Newtown opened up, the Steve Barry Quartet performed the swan song of the globally recognised space \u2013 the only Australian venue to make Downbeat mag\u2019s Top 100 jazz venues list.</p> <p>There was a surprisingly jubilant atmosphere at first. \u201cI think we\u2019re all in a little bit of denial,\u201d says Clare Hawley, one of the front of house staff.</p> <p>Barry\u2019s band (Ben Lerner, Tim Geldens and Thomas Botting) alternated between fragile and devastating rhythms, drawing indiscriminately from American and European jazz styles. They finished with the appropriately named Thelonious Monk tune \u201cBye-Ya\u201d, their ragged swing punctuating the end of an era. </p> <p>The audience was uncharacteristically quiet during the performance \u2013 and when it was over, they stood and filed out of the Edwardian ballroom as if in a daze.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85f54e27d251e69925fd89de3feb6797cbb22555\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85f54e27d251e69925fd89de3feb6797cbb22555/0_0_8192_5464/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The piano bears the signatures of prominent musicians who have played at 505\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The piano bears the signatures of prominent musicians who have played at 505.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The venue started with a friendship. Sydney Fringe director and theatre-maker Kerrie Glasscock and bass virtuoso Cameron Undy met in 2005, and shortly after moved into Hibernian House \u2013 the five-story, graffiti-covered assortment of studios, galleries, event spaces and apartments that\u2019s spawned and nurtured a vibrant collection of the city\u2019s creatives. This is where they would open the first iteration of 505, a hub of adventurous music and avant garde theatre named for the address: 505/347 Elizabeth Street. A year later, they were married.</p> <p>In 2010, the music program outgrew their loungeroom, and moved into a former strip club on Cleveland Street where they ran shows for ten years. Glasscock moved the theatre program to 5 Eliza Street in 2015, after it too outgrew their original space, and dubbed it the Old 505 Theatre. After the Cleveland Street venue closed in 2019, the theatre and music space were reunited under one roof.</p> <p>Through it all, a consistent philosophy has guided the pair: if we want culture to evolve, performers need a safe place to take risks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6676d4b95c133d5f9f1a77457cbc5fafa676ccd3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6676d4b95c133d5f9f1a77457cbc5fafa676ccd3/0_0_6612_4410/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Steve Barry Quartet\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Steve Barry Quartet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>505 played a central role in my creative life.

      "bodyText": "Since it opened in 2007, the small Sydney jazz club 505 has become an institution. The kind of place elite international musicians such as Chris Dave and Charlie Watts might \u201cdrop in\u201d just to see what\u2019s happening, and where a whole generation of musicians \u2013 including Ngaiire and Sirens Big Band \u2013 cut their teeth, playing to an audience that\u2019s more likely to cheer loudly or yell curses than give the expected polite finger snaps. The venue has moved across three premises in its lifetime, but to enter any feels like walking into an unusually spacious and well-decorated sharehouse living room \u2013 paying homage, perhaps, to how it began, as a weekly \u201cboard games and jazz\u201d night in a Surry Hills rental. The furniture is a jumble \u2013 new, antique, well-loved \u2013 with humble staging and PA, and a piano that bears the signatures of musicians that have breathed life into it. Perch on one of 505\u2019s rickety stools and you\u2019ll be so close to the performers you can see spit and woodchips flying across the stage. And on Friday night, the 5 Eliza Street venue became the latest casualty of Sydney\u2019s music scene, leaving the way it entered: with no ceremony, good company and world class music. As the skies above Newtown opened up, the Steve Barry Quartet performed the swan song of the globally recognised space \u2013 the only Australian venue to make Downbeat mag\u2019s Top 100 jazz venues list. There was a surprisingly jubilant atmosphere at first. \u201cI think we\u2019re all in a little bit of denial,\u201d says Clare Hawley, one of the front of house staff. Barry\u2019s band (Ben Lerner, Tim Geldens and Thomas Botting) alternated between fragile and devastating rhythms, drawing indiscriminately from American and European jazz styles. They finished with the appropriately named Thelonious Monk tune \u201cBye-Ya\u201d, their ragged swing punctuating the end of an era. The audience was uncharacteristically quiet during the performance \u2013 and when it was over, they stood and filed out of the Edwardian ballroom as if in a daze. The venue started with a friendship. Sydney Fringe director and theatre-maker Kerrie Glasscock and bass virtuoso Cameron Undy met in 2005, and shortly after moved into Hibernian House \u2013 the five-story, graffiti-covered assortment of studios, galleries, event spaces and apartments that\u2019s spawned and nurtured a vibrant collection of the city\u2019s creatives. This is where they would open the first iteration of 505, a hub of adventurous music and avant garde theatre named for the address: 505/347 Elizabeth Street. A year later, they were married. In 2010, the music program outgrew their loungeroom, and moved into a former strip club on Cleveland Street where they ran shows for ten years. Glasscock moved the theatre program to 5 Eliza Street in 2015, after it too outgrew their original space, and dubbed it the Old 505 Theatre. After the Cleveland Street venue closed in 2019, the theatre and music space were reunited under one roof. Through it all, a consistent philosophy has guided the pair: if we want culture to evolve, performers need a safe place to take risks. 505 played a central role in my creative life. There, I learned live music is at its most exciting when it is precarious, dangerous; where things feel like they might fall apart at any moment. I attended my first show at 505 in December 2010: a Drip Hards album launch that would change my philosophy on creativity for ever. I fondly recall arguing with my co-workers afterward about whether the music was serious art or if they\u2019d just been taking the piss. I argued it was both, and that that was a good thing. This was the first of more than 200 nights I would spend at 505 on Cleveland Street, consuming rivers of Italian coffee and Polish beer, trying to find my footing under seasick rhythms of some of the most adventurous music I\u2019ve ever heard. According to Glasscock, what set 505 apart was curation, not just of its performers but its audiences too. \u201cWhen we first started 505, it was word-of-mouth only, very deliberately,\u201d she says. \u201cWe only wanted respectful people [to come], and over time this amazing community of like minded people grew, and they were really protective of the place.\u201d This forged a community-minded space where artists of all levels felt supported to try new material. You were just as likely to find Sydney Conservatorium students chasing the sound in their heads as Katie Noonan, Wendy Matthews or Ian Moss starting their latest tour. It didn\u2019t seem to matter who was on \u2013 I never saw the place less than thriving. For Glasscock and Undy, it all came down to prioritising trust in artists and their ideas above all else. \u201cWe started from the premise of giving artists a place to show their work, which is a very different place to start for an entertainment venue,\u201d Glasscock says. \u201cWe wanted people to come to us with an idea \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t need to be a fully fledged thing \u2026 because you\u2019re trusting an idea as opposed to wanting to see a product.\u201d The combination of classic Australian talent, modern theatre and new music may be another part of what made the 505 project unique. The pair have always favoured new work that maintains a connection to the past. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been big on that at 505,\u201d Glasscock says. \u201cYou have to honour, to respect, [the past] \u2013 to acknowledge why, how and who got you where you are.\u201d While closing 505 is a \u201cpersonal choice,\u201d the venue has been under increasing financial pressure. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced completely independent bricks and mortar businesses are ever coming back,\u201d Glasscock says. \u201cThe real estate market is just ridiculous, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s for our sector any more.\u201d Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Running the venue has had its challenges but they say it\u2019s been worth it. Undy remembers fondly the time he had a steak at the club with one of his heroes, bass player Pino Palladino, and the time Grammy-winning Melbourne band Hiatus Kaiyote took to 505\u2019s tiny stage, mere months before they exploded into international stardom. Glasscock glows with pride as she speaks of what 505 has achieved for the theatre community, \u201cproviding a space for experimental theatre that would be otherwise impossible to stage\u201d. The loss to Australian culture is incalculable. Where will the ideas go?",

One lovely pass to Nowell on left wing but a brain freeze when gathering Danty\u2019s kick with a foot in touch. 4 14 Freddie Steward Roamed off his wing and had some joy in the air against France\u2019s back three. Finished off a much-needed try too when England were on top. 8 13 Joe Marchant One of England\u2019s best performers. Made some ground up the middle and almost evaded Penaud\u2019s desperate tackle for a try. 7 12 Henry Slade Kept trying to find ways to create gaps in the French defence but rarely found a way though the wall of blue. Forced things a bit too much. 6 11 Jack Nowell Escaped punishment for taking Jaminet out in the air and suffered nasty looking injury that ended his evening with his next attempt. 4 10 Marcus Smith The odd goose step and carried out his instructions when it came to hoisting the ball high. Didn\u2019t always look on same page as those outside him. 5 9 Ben Youngs Laborious at times and struggled to get England going. Kicking was fine, France knew exactly what to expect. Eddie Jones\u2019s scrum-half policy still feels confused. 5 1 Ellis Genge Again gave everything with countless carries in the backfield and some heroic tackling. His scrummaging suffered as a result, though. 7 2 Jamie George Not able to reproduce his heroics against Ireland but it was not for lack of effort. Luke Cowan-Dickie likely to come back into side this summer. 6 3 Will Stuart Praised by Jones for his cameo against Ireland but didn\u2019t reach the same heights here and was withdrawn with more than 30 minutes to go. 5 4 Maro Itoje Always tends to be one of England\u2019s most eye-catching performers and will always exert some influence. France did well to shackle him, however. 7 5 Nick Isiekwe Got the nod in front of Joe Launchbury for his lineout work and few complaints about that. Offered England little else though. 5 6 Courtney Lawes (capt) Never threw in the towel and came to the fore early in the second half as England rallied but, in truth, a comeback was never likely. 6 7 Sam Underhill Largely anonymous in the first half after recall to back row but far more involved in the third quarter, thundering into everything that moved, before he was replaced. 6 8 Sam Simmonds Almost dropped kick-off but settled thereafter. Has rarely managed to find the open spaces he craves throughout this tournament, however. 5 Replacements: Joe Marler (for Genge 65) Scrum did improve 6; Kyle Sinckler (for Stuart 49) A little off the pace 6; Ollie Chessum (for Isiekwe 63) Busy 7; Alex Dombrandt (for Underhill 65) Almost grabbed try with trademark running line 6; Harry Randall (for Youngs 65) Injected tempo 7; George Ford (for Furbank 77) n/a; Elliot Daly (for Nowell 26) Looked bright after another early introduction 6",

I was pretty gutted yesterday [when he was denied a first wicket by a no-ball] at the time thought I\u2019d let myself down and let the boys down.\u201d As for his actual first wicket, of Holder today, \u201cit sort of came out of nowhere from Jase [Holder] and a great catch from Fish. It was just a feeling of relief more than anything after what happened last night.</p> <p>\u201cReverse swing came in to play and it\u2019s quite slow so it\u2019s hard to bring edges into play. So I tried to stay disciplined for those fifth and sixth spells \u2013 it was a great effort from everyone to bowl them out. We\u2019ll be discussing how we\u2019re going to play it later, but we\u2019re going to have another crack at the tomorrow.

It\u2019s the ultimate test for the players. And it can also be quite a test for the mere spectator. Picture the scene: you save up for years to follow England on tour. The Caribbean in March! Trip of a lifetime! And then you find you\u2019ve booked in for five days of tedium. </p> <p>After three days of this match, there have been 13 wickets. At that rate, it would take six more days to get close to a result. While Tests elsewhere often finish early, West Indies\u2019 groundsmen are hell-bent on bringing back the draw. In Antigua it was a reasonably tense one, with a result still possible as the final session began. In Barbados, we\u2019ll be lucky to get anywhere near that.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s not just the groundsmen. West Indies have mostly batted like it\u2019s 1959, Alex Lees did the same for England, and even Joe Root, usually so fluent, found the boundary only once every 22 balls. Dan Lawrence and Ben Stokes went three times as fast as that and deserve medals for it. But in the field England have been almost as passive as West Indies with the bat. Root had Jack Leach wheeling away for hours on end, doing the same thing, expecting a different outcome. After bowling Jofra Archer and Mark Wood into the ground, he is now working on Leach \u2013 who, as a spinner, is better able to cope, but still, it made no sense to hand him the new ball when he was knackered and there were three specialist seamers kicking their heels.</p> <p>As a captain, Root remains superb at one facet of the job (leading from the front), good at another (being an ambassador), and hopeless at the rest: picking the team, reading the pitch, having a plan, having a back-up plan, making things happen, running the show. A strong captain is always one step ahead, yet Root was so dopey with his bowling changes yesterday that some OBOers had time to work out what was needed, compose an email, wait for us writers to get through the inbox, and still be half an hour ahead of the game. </p> <p>Jos Buttler has copped some flak for his poor Ashes with the bat, but without his sharp eye and cool head, Root even struggles with the reviews. Watching England yesterday, you\u2019d never have known that Root had captained them in more Tests than anyone in their history. </p> <p>That said, hope springs eternal, and I\u2019ll be delighted if he goes out there today and makes this opinion look silly. Play starts at 2pm GMT: see you then.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-03-19T21:15:00.313Z\">at 9.15pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "So this Test has been a long old slog, frustratingly lacking in actual long slogs (Ben Stokes apart), but we may yet have a tasty finish tomorrow. England have a lead from which they could conceivably carve out a competitive target for West Indies, but conditions, the pitch and captains\u2019 fear of defeat make the draw still the likelier result. The players must be knackered too, but you never know with Test cricket. And here\u2019s hoping for a bit of adventure and unpredictability. Thanks for reading and commenting \u2013 now run away and enjoy the rest of your weekends. Bye. Saqib Mahmood speaks on the day of his first Test wickets: \u201cIt was a long couple of days in the dirt \u2013 my first red-ball game since December, so I was glad to get off the field today. I was pretty gutted yesterday [when he was denied a first wicket by a no-ball] at the time thought I\u2019d let myself down and let the boys down.\u201d As for his actual first wicket, of Holder today, \u201cit sort of came out of nowhere from Jase [Holder] and a great catch from Fish. It was just a feeling of relief more than anything after what happened last night. \u201cReverse swing came in to play and it\u2019s quite slow so it\u2019s hard to bring edges into play. So I tried to stay disciplined for those fifth and sixth spells \u2013 it was a great effort from everyone to bowl them out. We\u2019ll be discussing how we\u2019re going to play it later, but we\u2019re going to have another crack at the tomorrow. I\u2019m a bit sore but these are the days you play for, in Test cricket.\u201d The umpires are having a look at the light, as dusk envelops the ground. Umpire Wilson says it\u2019s too dark for pace, and then they decide it\u2019s too dark for anything. That\u2019s that for the day. But what a day \u2013 nay, week \u2013 it has been for round-the-clock sportwatching, and England\u2019s women are starting their crucial World Cup match against New Zealand soon. You can follow it all here: 15th over: England 40-0 (Lees 18, Crawley 21). Holder replaces Seales at the other end, and tests Lees with his swing-tinged accuracy from around the wicket. But the Durham man is equal to it, playing out a maiden. 14th over: England 40-0 (Lees 18, Crawley 21). Brathwaite replaces Permaul with himself and his off-breaks. The England openers rotate the strike at will. England lead by 136. This match could yet get interesting. Admittedly I\u2019m making the word \u201cyet\u201d put an arduous shift in there. 13th over: England 35-0 (Lees 14, Crawley 20). The lesser-spotted pull shot is produced by Crawley, clobbering Seales to deep midwicket where Blackwood fields smartly and energetically on the boundary to cut out the four. Another single gives Seales a go at Lees, who pulls a short one away for another. Crawley then clips England past 30. Better still, he larrups the final ball of the over in front of square on the legside for a rare and welcome boundary. 12th over: England 25-0 (Lees 13, Crawley 11). Permaul\u2019s sixth over on the spin still induces the odd bout of uncertainty from Lees, but he\u2019s getting a little more confident. Without adding any more runs to his total. 11th over: England 24-0 (Lees 13, Crawley 10). Yet more dot balls in an unremarkable over from Seales, which prompts an unremarkable response from Crawley. One from the final ball of the over. \u201cEvening from Manchester clubland,\u201d brags Guy Hornsby, \u201cwhere I\u2019m following the cricket because it\u2019s objectively less depressing than the rugby. I\u2019m actually pretty glass half full here. We\u2019ve stuck at it, have a lead and will surely want to try and attack a target. Hope for the future.\u201d 10th over: England 23-0 (Lees 13, Crawley 9). Lees slices one away square on the offside for one and Crawley finds some width to crack another one square for another single. On we meander. 9th over: England 21-0 (Lees 12, Crawley 8). Seales replaces Roach from the Joel Garner End. When he gets his line right, he\u2019s a menace with the new ball, and there\u2019s not much Crawley is able to do until his fifth ball, which is wide down legside and Crawley tickles it on its way down to the boundary. England lead by 117 8th over: England 16-0 (Lees 11, Crawley 4). Permaul continues to find bounce and turn, though the odd short one concedes easy singles. Lees is well beaten with the last ball of the over, driving at one that spins in at him outside off, and it careers between bat and pad and under the keeper too for a bye. A risky shot. 7th over: England 13-0 (Lees 10, Crawley 3). Roach, round the wicket at Lees, offers some rare width on the offside, and the batter takes advantage, crunching an emphatic square drive for four. These openers beginning to look a bit more comfortable. \u201cCan we call this match off a day early and play an ODI tomorrow instead,\u201d wonders Matthew Lawreson, \u201cI know these guys aren\u2019t who the selectors would pick for a List A game, but it can\u2019t be worse than this, surely?\u201d Thing is, such is the beauty of Test cricket that it wouldn\u2019t take much tomorrow \u2013 a quickfire Stokes or Bairstow 50, a few quick West Indies second wickets \u2013 for this Test to suddenly become Really Gripping, prompting thousands of social media postings serenading the superior majesty of the five-day game. And not all of them would be by me. 6th over: England 8-0 (Lees 5, Crawley 3). Permaul continues, a bit more loosely, and some handy strike-rotating ones and twos ensue. 5th over: England 3-0 (Lees 1, Crawley 2). Roach is searingly accurate \u2013 he\u2019s got such a smooth, classy rhythm to his action \u2013 and there\u2019s not a lot Crawley can do. It\u2019s no surprise that Roach raps him on the pad with the last ball of the over. He\u2019s given out, but it\u2019s overturned. Excellent over, but no cigar. Crawley reviews. His best hope is that it\u2019s going down leg, which it is. An escape and umpire Duguid has a decision overturned again 4th over: England 3-0 (Lees 1, Crawley 2). Lees gets off the mark, pulling a short ball from Permaul to midwicket for a single, and Crawley sweeps for another. The spinner continues to confound Lees outside off-stump, with variable pace and bounce in that area. Some encouragement for West Indies, and perhaps for England too if their batters can get a wriggle on. 3rd over: England 1-0 (Lees 0, Crawley 1). I gather they\u2019re aiming for another 14 overs today, light permitting, but they may struggle to get through those. Crawley is watchful against Roach, playing out a maiden. Perhaps he should have more of a go, but that\u2019s easier said than done. While West Indies fans in the crowd get some percussion going, some words about its more decadent members: 2nd over: England 1-0 (Lees 0, Crawley 1). Funky captaincy! Permaul gets the new ball at the other end, Brathwaite evidently encouraged by Leach\u2019s new(ish)-ball stint earlier. He could strike, he could get mauled, but it\u2019s worth a go. Crawley nudges his first ball behind square for a single but he bamboozles Lees in the rough outside the left-hander\u2019s off-stump and beats him all ends up. The batter\u2019s struggling here, but survives. 1st over: England 0-0 (Lees 0, Crawley 0). Roach gets first use of the new ball in the evening sun, digging the first ball in short and inducing Lees to bottom-edge it on to his ribs. As might be expected from the most accomplished new-ball bowler on either side, Roach manages to extract a decent amount of pace and bite, and Lees can\u2019t work him away. A maiden to start, and England could do with as few of those as possible. The England openers are out in the middle. And it\u2019s Lees and Crawley as per Between-innings email, from Tom van de Gucht: \u201cI suppose the big question is, do you see any of these guys bowling in the next Ashes series? Apart from Stokes.\u201d Is it the big question though? A team to beat New Zealand, South Africa and West Indies should be the main current aim. Forget Australia. And I can see Mahmood and Fisher playing more Tests certainly. Depending on the state of the vast army of injured fast bowlers, several of whom are bound to be injured at any given time in the future. 187.5 overs: Jack Leach\u2019s 70th over \u2013 you\u2019d have to play at least 18 T20s to rack up that number \u2013 is his final one, as he finally wraps up the innings and gets his third scalp of it by snaring Da Silva, getting one to straighten and rapping his pads, and this one IS hitting, the review confirms. Leg stump to be precise. At last the innings is over. England have a first innings lead of 96. 187th over: West Indies 410-9 (Da Silva 32, Seales 5). Da Silva demonstrates his confidence in Seales by taking an easy single on the legside off the first ball of Saqib\u2019s over. And that confidence is repaid with some composed defence from the No 11. This will be irking England. 186th over: West Indies 410-9 (Da Silva 32, Seales 5). Root ushers Leach back on in place of himself, and the spinner\u2019s 69th over begins with an lbw shout against Seales but he\u2019d got well down the track and it was surely bouncing over. But two balls later he does prompt the umpire to raise the finger, only for Seales to review successfully. On we go. This looks a good shout initially but what do I know? It\u2019s turning down legside. 185th over: West Indies 410-9 (Da Silva 32, Seales 5). Mahmood could do with a slightly more attacking field to Da Silva, I think, with currently only one slip and an inner ring on the offside kind-of saving the one. As it happens, Da Silva tucks him square on the legside for a single, leaving Seales exposed for four balls. But he looks comfortable and takes a single off the third of them. Talking of alternative entertainment: 184th over: West Indies 408-9 (Da Silva 31, Seales 4). Root continues, with no great threat. And Seales gets off the mark with a neat cover drive for four. Give Lawrence a twirl? \u201cNot exactly leaving one sport for another,\u201d writes Paul Lakin, \u201cbut I was at Lord\u2019s for England v India in 1996 when play had to be paused because of all the cheering as the crowd followed the England/Spain penalty shoot out on their radios. Dickie Bird looked distinctly unimpressed.\u201d He might have thought differently if it was a Barnsley play-off perhaps. 183rd over: West Indies 403-9 (Da Silva 30, Seales 0). Mahmood pounds in around the wicket at Seales, though Curtly Ambrose on comms reckons he should go over and try to swing a few into his pads. As it is, coming round the wicket he raps Seales on the shin but he\u2019s inevitably outside the line of off-stump so half-hearted appeals are in vain. (Replays suggest it would have hit too). A maiden. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly ducking out of one sporting event to watch another,\u201d concedes Bob Boggis, \u201cbut I did give up on an A-level exam and walk out so I could watch the first game of the 1990 World Cup (Argentina versus the mighty Cameroon). Needless to say, my academic career was set back a few years, but a) it was worth it, and b) I did eventually end up with an M.A. and a fair amount of teaching work.\u201d An absolutely correct decision, Bob. 182nd over: West Indies 403-9 (Da Silva 30, Seales 0). As what I can only assume is the Barmy Army\u2019s resident Sheffield United fan blasts out another chorus of \u201cYou light up my senses\u201d, Root sends down an uneventful maiden. 181st over: West Indies 403-9 (Da Silva 30, Seales 0). Mahmood bowls a bouncer at Permaul \u2013 just to show that he can \u2013 and then snares Permaul, as the end of England\u2019s marathon fielding ordeal draws closer. In comes the left-handed Seales \u2013 Test average: 3 \u2013 who survives the last two balls of the over. England look set to have a first-innings lead for the first time in seven Tests, since September at the Oval in fact. What could possibly go wrong? Mahmood traps Permaul in front, the batsman reviews, because why not? But it\u2019s smacking the top of middle and Mahmood has a merited second Test wicket. 180th over: West Indies 402-8 (Da Silva 29, Permaul 5). Leach gets a breather and Root has a twirl in his stead, and gives his lungs some air with an absurdly optimistic lbw shout against Permaul for one that landed outside leg. Two singles from the over. \u201cNot really on topic,\u201d says Ben Mimmack as if that had ever bothered us before, \u201cbut I ignored the hedonistic delights of Shangri-La at Glastonbury 2005 to watch the All Blacks re-arrange Brian O\u2019Driscoll\u2019s shoulder on a big screen next to the Pyramid stage. A poor choice in retrospect.\u201d I dunno, it\u2019s all just thrashing about in the mud in pursuit of isolated and often elusive nuggets of entertainment either way isn\u2019t it? 179th over: West Indies 400-8 (Da Silva 28, Permaul 4). So, to the evening session: can England get those last two wickets swiftly and jump-start something? Saqib Mahmood returns to the attack and beats Da Silva with a slow low cutter first up, locating some variable/nonexistent bounce. The bowler\u2019s punished for straying down leg next ball though, and Da Silva deflects it fine and beyond the keeper for four to bring up West Indies\u2019 400. The next ball is flawless though, arrowed in and hitting Da Silva on the pad and prompting an appeal but it\u2019s not given. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing Saqib play Test cricket in more amenable conditions than this. \u201cAfternoon Tom.\u201d Afternoon John Little. \u201cOver 1,000 balls now in this innings. Perhaps an idea for a competition/series? I have a catchy name \u2013 The Thousand.\u201d Paul and co\u2019s email has got me to thinking about the subject of ducking out of one live sporting event to watch another. I snuck away from Wimbledon tennis in 2010 to watch England\u2019s unremarkable World Cup football win over Slovenia in a nearby pub, and there was talk of mass desertions to bars at Lord\u2019s during a Euro 96 England quarter-final. Anyone ever done that and missed Important Cricket? Perhaps you fled Edgbaston in 2005 to watch Solihull Moors or somesuch? Let us know. 178th over: West Indies 396-8 (Da Silva 24, Permaul 4). Woakes, fair play to him, is finding the odd bit of bounce and cracks Permaul on one of his spinning fingers with a sharp lifting delivery. The tailender needs some treatment and some strapping. Permal duly dabs the next one behind backward point for two. And it\u2019s time for tea. Talking of those poor, poor souls in the crowd, Paul, Ben, Hywel Lewis and the News write in: \u201cWe\u2019re here at the ground, kind of a tough watch. Our group is totally split about either staying, or heading into Bridgetown to watch England v France. Hoping you could conduct a Who-Wants~To-Be-A-Millionaire \u201cAsk the Audience\u201d type poll of the estimable OBO readership ...\u201d What do we think, people? My casting vote is for staying in the ground, obviously. Slow-moving live sport always always eclipses fast-moving stuff on a screen. You can always follow the rugby here. Back in a bit. This game might yet move on apace in the evening session now, you never know. 177th over: West Indies 394-8 (Da Silva 24, Permaul 2). Leach continues to find turn and bounce with the new ball, and Permaul looks as if he\u2019s agitating to have a slog but thinks better of it. He square cuts him for one, anyhow. The Barmy Army appear to have woken from their siesta. Imagine travelling all that way for this, with nothing to do but sit in the sun eating fried fish. What an outsized violin we must play for them. 176th over: West Indies 393-8 (Da Silva 24, Permaul 1). Woakes continues to Dasilva, who\u2019s now digging in for the long haul himself by the looks, having faced 80 balls. It\u2019s a maiden, and an unremarkable one. 175th over: West Indies 393-8 (Da Silva 24, Permaul 1). Leach has a big shout for caught behind \u2013 and it was worth one \u2013 after ripping one past Permaul\u2019s edge. But no reviews, no dice. \u201cMay I remind all the moaners that cricket is a sport, not an episode of Some Mothers Do Have\u2019em, or whatever,\u201d roars Tone White (ask your grandad). \u201cThese are sportsmen trying to out-do each other under local conditions, grueling work for which they train. Ever watched a F1 grand prix all the way through, a long distance walking race, a marathon .... if people want entertainment they can watch a film, read a book, knit a pair of socks! But if you\u2019re watching test cricket you\u2019re watching an endurance sport. Follow all those tired muscles and aching feet, understand the concentration involved, don\u2019t moan about being bored.\u201d I\u2019ve done all of those things and even run a marathon, and yeah, none of them are as much fun as Test cricket, and all are funnier than Some Mothers Do Have Them 174th over: West Indies 393-8 (Da Silva 24, Permaul 1). Just wondering \u2013 without having time to look it up \u2013 when was the last Test in which no side was bowled out in any innings? Mind, it looks as if this match won\u2019t be one of them now, as Roach is West Indies\u2019 eighth man out, lbw to Woakes. Permaul \u2013 who knows a thing or two about luckless toil on this surface - is the new batsman in and is swiftly off the mark. Roach is hit on the front pad in front (ish). And reviews. It was slanting in on him, but clipping leg stump and the bowler gets the umpire\u2019s call. Woakes has his first wicket in 52 overs. 173rd over: West Indies 392-7 (Da Silva 24, Roach 1). A boundary! Not seen any of those since before sunset (UK time), Da Silva rocking back and square cutting Leach for four with some panache. The spinner then yells for an lbw when rapping Dasilva\u2019s back pad as he misses a clip through leg, but it\u2019s drifting down. That was a record-busting 66th over from Leach. Come for the sun, stay for the stats. 172nd over: West Indies 387-7 (Da Silva 20, Roach 1). Woakes, the most obvious fish out of water in this series (and I say this as a fan of him both as a cricketer and a bloke), is belatedly given the new ball he was ostensibly selected on this tour to have first use of. He\u2019s reasonably probing and accurate. One from the over. 171st over: West Indies 387-7 (Da Silva 19, Roach 1). Leach now has a properly attacking field, one in close in front of the wicket on the off and one on the leg, but Roach reads him well and dabs out a maiden. Can England get these last three wickets in time to have a bit of a slog in the later stages today? Will they try to have a slog? 170th over: West Indies 387-7 (Da Silva 19, Roach 1). After the PA blasts out a turgid and inappropriate blast of We Will Rock You between overs, Roach gets off the mark with a single to fine leg. One of two runs from an uneventful Fisher over. 169th over: West Indies 385-7 (Da Silva 18, Roach 0). Leach is given a go with that new ball, and gets it to sing, seeing off Brathwaite with a beauty. Just before that, I\u2019d received this email from Liam Taylor, jinxing the home captain: \u201cSurely the main excitement now is seeing how long Brathwaite can bat? He has now faced more balls than Babar Azam did for Pakistan last week. More than Laxman did in scoring 281 against Australia in 2001. More than Matthew Hayden did when he hit 380 to set the world record in 2003. When he reaches 492, he\u2019ll have equalled Atherton at Johannesburg in 1995. We are witnessing history being made - very slowly.\u201d Or not. BRATHWAITE IS OUT! Leach gets the new ball and does him with a a beauty, pitched on middle and leg and jagging away to take out off. And thus ends a marathon demonstration of concentration and defiance from the West Indies captain. 168th over: West Indies 383-6 (Brathwaite 159, Da Silva 17). Dasilva\u2019s looking pretty comfortable now after a ropey start and he flays Fisher through the covers for two. This is no time or place for a seamer to be starting their Test career. 167th over: West Indies 381-6 (Brathwaite 159, Da Silva 15). Remember how \u2013 a couple of short weeks ago \u2013 Stokes was being talked about as very much a mere back-up bowler on this tour? Well, he has now bowled more overs in the series than any other seamer. He\u2019s getting as much out of the pitch as any of them too, and he even induces a loose edge from Brathwaite, but it flies over the slips for four. Thems the breaks. And he comes back at him with an inswinger that almost takes out off stump. A really good over in the circumstanes 166th over: West Indies 375-6 (Brathwaite 154, Da Silva 14). Brathwaite takes a leisurely single off Fisher, and not much else happens. Hey ho. 165th over: West Indies 374-6 (Brathwaite 153, Da Silva 14). Stokes continues, and Dasilva \u2013 currently monopolising the strike to give his captain a breather \u2013 flicks him through the legside for two. He\u2019s also beaten all ends up by a beautifully shaped scrambled-seam outswinger 164th over: West Indies 372-6 (Brathwaite 153, Da Silva 12). Fisher is preferred to Woakes at the other end, and gifts Dasilva an easy carved two followed by an easy carved single square on the offside with wide deliveries. Worth letting a spinner see if they can get some grip and rip with the new ball? And now it\u2019s time for a sponsored drinks break. 163rd over: West Indies 369-6 (Brathwaite 153, Da Silva 9) The new ball is taken and Ben Stokes is given first use of it, not a privilege often conferred on him. There\u2019s movement off the seam and some carry, but no great threat. Dasilva tucks the widest ball of the over down to fine leg for its only run. 162nd over: West Indies 368-6 (Brathwaite 153, Da Silva 8) The third Fisher replaces Saqib and has a shout for lbw straight away but it\u2019s turned down and England have no reviews left. Looked as if it was going down the legside anyway. A couple of easy singles ensue. \u201cAs the front-line attack tires, I note that Alex Lees bowls leg spin,\u201d writes Tim Sanders, \u201cwith a first-class bowling average of 32; his strike rate is a shade better than a wicket every four overs. \u2018Get Lee-sy On !\u2019 I say. Just don\u2019t tell Jack Leach that most of that is down to some odorous declaration bowling in the 2016 Lords game that denied Somerset the county championship.\u201d What a match that was. And old-school County Championship declaration bowling might be the only thing that revives this match now. Get all the pie-chuckers on. 161st over: West Indies 366-6 (Brathwaite 152, Da Silva 7) The third \u2013 count \u2019em \u2013 new ball is now available, but Root gives it a swerve, for now, thinking that the old ball might give his bowlers some swerve. Brathwaite is utterly unflappable though, turning a single through square leg. Dasilva then picks up four with a low edge through the slips that was never at catchable height. \u201cWhy the snide remarks about the way Windies are approaching this test match?\u201d writes Paul Sokhy. \u201cThey are not going to hand this match to England why should they. If the boot was on the other foot people be saying what a rearguard action by England to save the match such character, resilience blah blah. One thing for sure England aint gonna win this match i think the expectation was they\u2019d roll over the windies by day three not what they are getting strong disciplined resistance and by playing good cricket. Ah well the Barmy army is a bit quiet.\u201d I think West Indies have done all they\u2019ve needed to do to be honest, when faced with 500 on the board against them, but when neither the pitch nor the bowling attacks are offering you a match then it\u2019s understandable that one might feel bored and irritable. 160th over: West Indies 361-6 (Brathwaite 151, Da Silva 3) Mahmood, who\u2019s busting a gut to inject some life into this game, has an lbw shout against Dasilva \u2013 who\u2019s spent his innings looking like an lbw shout waiting to happen \u2013 but it\u2019s clearly going down leg. He\u2019s also still getting the odd one to lift, ending his over with a bouncer, that Dasilva gets under. 159th over: West Indies 361-6 (Brathwaite 151, Da Silva 3) Thanks Tim, and evening/afternoon everyone. A result \u2013 like world peace and social justice - is theoretically possible, you just don\u2019t quite know how. Stokes\u2019s over passes uneventfully, like so much of this game. And that\u2019s me done. Brathwaite can go on for ever, Leach can match him dot for dot, but I\u2019m exhausted just watching them so I\u2019m going to hand over to Tom Davies, who will keep you throughly entertained in a way that the match may not. Thanks for your company, correspondence and support for my campaign to relieve Joe Root of the burdens of captaincy. 158th over: West Indies 360-6 (Brathwaite 150, Da Silva 3) Mahmood, who has been bowling length, suddenly digs one in and produces a rip-snorting lifter. Da Silva might have found two or three ways to get out to it, but Brathwaite is able to let it go by. That\u2019s a maiden. Mahmood\u2019s spell since lunch looks more like a PIN number: 4-1-5-1. 157th over: West Indies 360-6 (Brathwaite 150, Da Silva 3) England think they\u2019ve got Da Silva again as a ball from Leach ends up in the hands of short leg. They review, but it\u2019s pad-only, and well outside leg stump. Another bad review. Somewhere in south-west London, a Mr J Buttler rolls his eyes. Brathwaite, facing Leach of course, shovels to mid-on and takes a quick single to move to 150. He has used up 458 balls and hit 16 of them for four. 156th over: West Indies 359-6 (Brathwaite 149, Da Silva 3) Da Silva is doing his best to be LBW after all, shuffling across, planting his left pad in front of off stump and playing with half a bat. Mahmood can smell that second wicket but he bowls a no-ball. Jonny Bairstow is at mid-off, offering advice, possibly along the lines of \u201cdo anything you like, but don\u2019t overstep\u201d. 155th over: West Indies 357-6 (Brathwaite 148, Da Silva 3) Another over from Leach, another single to Brathwaite. One day these two will be a double act, touring provincial theatres under the Test Match Special banner, wrily recalling their joint marathon. 154th over: West Indies 356-6 (Brathwaite 147, Da Silva 3) Great to see Mahmood making an impression. More than any England seamer since Jofra Archer, he carries himself like a fast bowler \u2013 confident, aggressive, charismatic. Mahmood spears another one in and Da Silva is given out LBW, but he reviews and escapes because there\u2019s a spike on Snicko. Da Silva himself clearly didn\u2019t think he\u2019d hit it, as he took an age to make the signal. 153rd over: West Indies 356-6 (Brathwaite 147, Da Silva 3) So with the ball reversing, who\u2019s going to bowl from the other end? How about Jack Leach? He wheels through over 61, and each batter takes a single. 152nd over: West Indies 354-6 (Brathwaite 146, Da Silva 2) Saqib, with his tail up, reverses a length ball into Joshua Da Silva\u2019s pads, but the appeal is stifled because there\u2019s an inside edge. Da Silva gets off the mark with a stab to third man. That stroke was quite unlike anything Holder had attempted before. Did the West Indians sit down over lunch and decide it was time to go on the attack? We shall see. And it\u2019s not a no-ball! Saqib Mahmood finally gets his first Test wicket as Holder skies a pull and Matt Fisher takes a fine swirling catch at mid-on. A tale of two debutants. Is play the right word for this? I\u2019m beginning to have my doubts. Jack Leach has already bowled 60 overs in this game. \u201cA stultifying Test in Barbados,\u201d says Andy Zaltzman on Twitter, \u201chas enabled Jack Leach to become the third England bowler in the last 30 years to bowl 60+ overs in a Test innings. George Geary\u2019s all-time record of 81 (MCG, 1928-29) could be within reach. Thrilling times.\u201d In case you\u2019re wondering who the other two were, one was Ashley Giles (65-16-190-2) against Sri Lanka in Colombo in 2003. I wonder what happened to him? The other was Monty Panesar (60-15-116-0) against South Africa in 2008, at Lord\u2019s of all places. Sixty overs without a wicket! An email comes in from Brad Elliott in Nairobi, entitled \u201cSomething worse\u201d. It begins with a bit of Bruce Springsteen. \u201cIs it something worse That sends me down to the river Though I know the river is dry. \u201cI grew up with a not-so secret love for the Windies, despite growing up in Worcestershire in the 80s. Man, what has happened? \u201cI\u2019ve loved cricket for 30+ years (only Test cricket really of the international stage). I don\u2019t mind big losses from either side given my Englishness (e.g. 1988-2004) and aforementioned love, but damn. Test cricket is already struggling. Why the boringness? Better to smash out to 450 all out, no, than put the remaining fans through turgid tripe? \u201cI live in Kenya, where cricket was once a reasonably big thing, but now isn\u2019t really. I recently played in an over-40s\u2019 T10 because people don\u2019t even have the patience for T20 at local level. Why kill thing the thing you love? \u201cFear has ruined the 2020s in so many ways already; but the Windies in Barbados, batting like it\u2019s a 9-day test? Brathwaite blocking in the 140s (not totally his fault maybe). My son (8), LHB, right arm over, can\u2019t get behind this. He\u2019s like \u2018when is something happening?\u2019 \u201cThose memories come back to haunt me. They haunt me like a curse Is a dream a lie if it don\u2019t come true Or is it something worse? \u201cKeep up the good work, no need to publish unless you think there\u2019s anything of interest. \u201cWarmly, BE in Nairobi/Kigali.\u201d We have another stoppage, though it doesn\u2019t look like being any longer than the earlier ones. 151st over: West Indies 351-5 (Brathwaite 145, Holder 12) Holder dabs Woakes\u2019s first ball for a single, and the prospect looms of what Ian Bishop would call a torrent of runs. But then Brathwaite remembers who he is and plays out five dots. He has now faced 444 balls. And that is lunch, with West Indies still sitting pretty, in a grim kind of way. They have added 63 off 34 overs this morning, and they now trail by 156. Time for some fresh air \u2013 see you in half an hour. 150th over: West Indies 350-5 (Brathwaite 145, Holder 11) Leach bowls the 150th over, which may well feel like his 150th over. The first ball is a good one, taking the edge of Holder\u2019s bat, but squirting away for a single. Brathwaite, roused from his slumber, cuts for two to bring up the 350. 149th over: West Indies 347-5 (Brathwaite 143, Holder 10) Woakes to Brathwaite: another maiden. This partnership has been a right bundle of laughs, adding 11 off 77 balls. 148th over: West Indies 347-5 (Brathwaite 143, Holder 10) Leach has bowled seven overs in this spell and conceded precisely one run. For Holder he now has a silly point, something you don\u2019t often see in the age of DRS. Make that eight overs for one run. 147th over: West Indies 347-5 (Brathwaite 143, Holder 10) Off goes Stokes, on comes Woakes. And he almost takes a wicket! He finds some extra bounce from somewhere and persuades Brathwaite to pop the ball up to short leg \u2013 but not to the short leg who\u2019s actually there, more of a short midwicket. 146th over: West Indies 347-5 (Brathwaite 143, Holder 10) Leach to Holder: another maiden. A small boy in search of some entertainment climbs onto a jet-ski and rides it standing up. I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s going to be a Test batter when he grows up. Here\u2019s John Starbuck again. \u201cThe Pogues (141st over - don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever written to the OBO before quoting such a large figure) did perform with The Dubliners in singing The Irish Rover, a famous folk nonsense song. What most people don\u2019t realise is that they helped out with a version containing all the filthy bits too. You can find it on Son of Rogues Gallery if you are so inclined.\u201d 145th over: West Indies 347-5 (Brathwaite 143, Holder 10) With Holder at Leach\u2019s end, someone else is going to have bowl a maiden to Brathwaite. The task falls to Stokes. 144th over: West Indies 347-5 (Brathwaite 143, Holder 10) Correction: this over is the first Leach has bowled to Holder. Rookie error! In my defence, I was busy putting capital letters on all those music venues. For some reason this morning\u2019s correspondents have not been keen on caps, which is fine when you\u2019re emailing a mate but a bit of a pain when you\u2019re expecting to be published on one of the world\u2019s leading news sites. 143rd over: West Indies 347-5 (Brathwaite 143, Holder 10) Stokes again gets the better of Holder, but again finds no joy: the edge drops short of slip. Soft hands, soft pitch, soft ball, hard yakka. Martin Crookall is back to answer the question about whether he was joking (136th over). \u201cOn the contrary, no. This was the Test cricket I grew up on, placid, serene and thoughtful. I\u2019d sit all day in front of the TV, live broadcast from the BBC, watching the spinners wheel away. It was gentle and calming. Mind you, this stuff you\u2019re commenting on now is a bore and Joe Root is a rubbish captain.\u201d 142nd over: West Indies 346-5 (Brathwaite 143, Holder 9) Leach bowls to Holder for the first time. And records a maiden, for the 21st time. 141st over: West Indies 346-5 (Brathwaite 143, Holder 9) A single! To Holder, dabbing Stokes to third man. And another, to Brathwaite, tucking behind square leg. Then Stokes, tackling Holder again, beats the bat, getting a length ball to hold its line. \u201cAfternoon Tim,\u201d says Mark Little. \u201cIt is always nice to remember Kirsty Mac/Fairytale, but it occurred to me that I couldn\u2019t remember another Pogues song despite many a happy night in their company at the Town &amp; Country Club and Electric Ballroom, Kilburn National and other lowlife venues in N London.\u201d That\u2019s OK, Shane MacGowan can\u2019t remember them either. \u201cOn the subject of lowlife venues, will anything happen today d\u2019ya think?\u201d I wouldn\u2019t bet on it. 140th over: West Indies 344-5 (Brathwaite 142, Holder 8) Leach to Brathwaite, yet again. Brathwaite has now faced 332 dot balls, many of them from Leach. Their personal duel has occupied 190 balls and yielded 43 runs. It has been, let\u2019s face it, an epic bore. 139th over: West Indies 344-5 (Brathwaite 142, Holder 8) Stokes to Holder again, one star all-rounder to another. Holder does a Brathwaite, stamping his authority on the first ball of the over \u2013 a half-volley, driven past mid-off with the greatest of ease. 138th over: West Indies 340-5 (Brathwaite 142, Holder 4) Jack Leach seems perfectly willing to bowl all day, which is lucky because that\u2019s exactly what Joe Root has in mind for him. He gets a nick, but Brathwaite\u2019s hands are soft and the ball falls short of Zak Crawley at slip. This delivery, by the way, is the 400th Brathwaite has faced. 137th over: West Indies 340-5 (Brathwaite 142, Holder 4) When England batted, the two men who moved the game along were Lawrence and Stokes, and now they\u2019ve done it again. That\u2019s the good news. The bad news is that Joseph has been replaced by Jason Holder, who, the last time he faced England on this ground, made an unbeaten double century. Stokes does find his edge right away, but it\u2019s a controlled one that goes along the ground and trickles away for four. At last! Stokes lures Joseph into a slash and Dan Lawrence, at a deepish gully, does very well to see it, let alone hold onto it. 136th over: West Indies 336-4 (Brathwaite 142, Joseph 19) Leach is denied another maiden when Joseph goes back to play a classy shot, a force through the covers that deserves more than a single. \u201cRoot\u2019s overuse of Jack Leach takes me back,\u201d says Martin Crookall, \u201cto the Tests of the early Seventies, and sessions that would be bowled straight through, without change, by Ray Illingworth at one end and Derek Underwood at the other, piling up maidens by the score. I miss those days.\u201d Is it safe to assume you\u2019re joking? 135th over: West Indies 335-4 (Brathwaite 142, Joseph 18) Brathwaite prods Stokes to third man again, for two this time, and that brings up the fifty partnership off 22-1 overs. Nightwatchmen can be so annoying. 134th over: West Indies 333-4 (Brathwaite 140, Joseph 18) Yes, Leach was just changing ends, so here he is bowling his 52nd over. By the time West Indies are all out he could be on 100. For such a nice guy, Joe Root can be a bit of a gang-master. 133rd over: West Indies 333-4 (Brathwaite 140, Joseph 18) You\u2019d think England would have spotted by now that Brathwaite feasts on width and on the first ball of an over. Ben Stokes comes on and his loosener is outside off, so Brathwaite just has to dab it to pick up four to third man. On the plus side, Leach is getting a breather \u2013 unless he\u2019s changing ends. 132nd over: West Indies 329-4 (Brathwaite 136, Joseph 18) Where Leach wheels away, Lawrence whirls away. And although he\u2019s done well in this series, he does have the part-timer\u2019s habit of bowling one bad ball per over. After five dots, he gives Joseph a juicy long hop and is pulled for six, just over the man at deep square. 131st over: West Indies 323-4 (Brathwaite 136, Joseph 12) Leach continues and maintains his policy of producing one ripper per over. This one, to Brathwaite, takes off from a length and goes so high that Ben Foakes does very well to reach it: if it had been a tennis ball, he would have been able to smash it. Maybe it is a tennis ball and that\u2019s why it bounced so high and so harmlessly. 130th over: West Indies 323-4 (Brathwaite 136, Joseph 12) Brathwaite drives the first ball of Lawrence\u2019s second over for three. He does love to assert himself at the start of an over or a spell. 129th over: West Indies 320-4 (Brathwaite 133, Joseph 12) Another over from Leach, another single to Brathwaite. It\u2019s a match made in purgatory. 128th over: West Indies 319-4 (Brathwaite 132, Joseph 12) Lawrence finishes his over, Joseph has a mow and gets away with an uppish slice. \u201cA torrent of runs this morning,\u201d says Ian Bishop. You what? We\u2019ve had 31 in 11 overs. \u201cLet\u2019s go further,\u201d says David McCairley, \u201cwhy the need for the captain to be alive at all? Judicious use of the ouija board could extend England\u2019s options. WG Grace perhaps or Boycott (still alive maybe?).\u201d Boycott?! Yes, still alive, but he was only ever a stand-in captain, when Mike Brearley was injured, and it went so well that Ian Botham ran him out on purpose. 127.5 overs: West Indies 317-4 (Brathwaite 132, Joseph 10) Root has been more proactive this morning with his bowling changes, at least at one end. He replaces Mahmood with Dan Lawrence, or, as Butcher calls him, the Chingford Chandrasekhar. He finds some turn, but then the rain returns and the players trot off. We\u2019ve had a third of a session and it has belonged to West Indies, though Jack Leach has been inches away from finding some joy with his periodic rippers. 127th over: West Indies 315-4 (Brathwaite 131, Joseph 9) \u201cHow did that miss?\u201d exclaims Curtly Ambrose as Leach bamboozles Brathwaite with another jaffa \u2013 and still doesn\u2019t find the edge. This one, unlike the other rippers, was 90kph. \u201cSo maybe,\u201d says Mark Butcher, \u201cthings are beginning to happen on this pitch.\u201d We can but hope. 126th over: West Indies 313-4 (Brathwaite 130, Joseph 8) Mahmood finds his groove, but still no threat. This is his second tour of the Caribbean this year and in four matches \u2013 three T20 and this one \u2013 he has yet to take a wicket. But at least he\u2019s not going for 13 runs an over. 125th over: West Indies 312-4 (Brathwaite 129, Joseph 8) Poor old Leach: not good enough as yet to dismiss top-order batters on this surface, but far too good for Alzarri Joseph, who gets another ripper. This is another maiden, but the edge that flew to the vacant leg slip brought up Leach\u2019s hundred. His figures are 48-16-100-1, and that\u2019s the most overs he has bowled in a Test innings. \u201cOn the captaincy front,\u201d says Kim Thonger, \u201ca trick is being missed. Mark Wood, with a variety of close imaginary animal advisors, could be a marvellous captain. He could gallop round the field on his imaginary horse, marshalling the troops, deploy an imaginary owl for wise DRS decisions, unleash an imaginary parrot to sledge on his behalf, release an imaginary tiger to fire up pace bowlers with the prospect of being eaten if their all is not given. The possibilities and permutations of an imaginary menagerie are literally infinite. Plus, what a top bloke.\u201d 124th over: West Indies 312-4 (Brathwaite 129, Joseph 8) Fisher gives way to Saqib Mahmood, one debutant replacing another. The result is much the same, only more so: a wide one, flayed for four by Brathwaite, who also picks up two twos in the same area. West Indies have avoided the follow-on: they trail by just 195 runs. 123rd over: West Indies 304-4 (Brathwaite 121, Joseph 8) Leach bowls a peach to Joseph, far too good to take the edge of a tail-ender\u2019s bat \u2013 pitching middle, lifting and turning and heading for slip. In a perfect world, the batter would have been Mike Gatting. \u201cIn this modern day and age,\u201d says Andrew Benton, \u201cwhy do we need a captain to be on the field of play? Why not let the players play, and the captain can captain remotely from the pavilion. That way, a captain can be selected for captaining abilities alone. And could even be a woman in a man\u2019s match.\u201d 122nd over: West Indies 304-4 (Brathwaite 121, Joseph 8) Brathwaite, facing Fisher, waits for the bad ball, which comes along at the end of the over: a long hop, cut away for four. 121st over: West Indies 300-4 (Brathwaite 117, Joseph 8) Leach has a chat with Root and they remove his leg slip for Brathwaite \u2013 whereupon an edge loops up off the inside edge to just where the guy no longer is. That\u2019s bad luck more than bad judgment, though it is quite early in the day to be making a defensive change. \u201cNice to see Kirsty MacColl remembered,\u201d says John Starbuck, \u201cbut Shakespeare did get there first. Glendower: I can call creatures from the vasty deep. Hotspur: Why, so can I, so can any man; But will they come when you do call for them? \u201cHenry IV Pt 1. One of the great put-downs.\u201d 120th over: West Indies 299-4 (Brathwaite 116, Joseph 8) Fisher goes full to Joseph, hoping for a nick to the cordon only slip. Joseph is equal to it, square-driving for four. He has a Test best of 86, apparently, so maybe he\u2019s eyeing a hundred. 119th over: West Indies 295-4 (Brathwaite 116, Joseph 4) And from the other end, it\u2019s... Jack Leach! With a curious field, a slip and two short legs, as if they think the arm ball is more dangerous than Leach\u2019s stock-in-trade. Brathwaite, very happy for Leach to aim at his legs, nudges the first ball for two. \u201cPoor old Root,\u201d says David Alcock. \u201cI have a lot of love for the guy - local lad, went to the same school as my partner\u2019s lass, sublime batsman, etc. But, some of his Yorkshire nicknames have become cuttingly accurate. I\u2019d add a Homeric epithet: Craptain Cliche, Breaker of Bowlers. Sorry Joe. \u201cRegarding a Broad captaincy being mooted again - I thought that sort of chatter was the primary reason for him and Anderson getting dropped... or am I being too cynical?\u201d 118th over: West Indies 293-4 (Brathwaite 114, Joseph 4) Root hands the ball to Matthew Fisher, perhaps to make up for spurning him when this ball was news. His loosener is a bit too loose, so Brathwaite leg-glances the first ball for four. Warming to the task, Fisher bowls a good bouncer to the nightwatchman, Alzarri Joseph, who freezes and takes a blow to the hand. The players are on the field. It\u2019s cloudy right now, but the forecast is solid sunshine. This series has been all about the imbalance between bat and ball. \u201cIt\u2019s all dead tracks now,\u201d says Kemar Roach in a statement that BT Sport showed on the screen just now. You can see this in the series stats: Dan Lawrence, not content with being top of the series averages, is the only bowler with a strike rate better than 66 balls per wicket. It is taking all the proper bowlers at least 11 overs to come by a wicket. England\u2019s specialist seamers are all going along at over 100 balls per wicket, with poor old Chris Woakes on 330. Another view of the captaincy comes in from Andy Flintoff (\u201cnot that one\u201d). \u201cIf this were a few years ago,\u201d he argues, \u201cthen my choice for replacement captain would have been Anderson, who if I recall correctly, has stood in in the past. Now he\u2019s being eased out of the set-up, then it\u2019d probably have to be Stokes or Broad, as long as they don\u2019t fall foul of my namesake\u2019s failings which were to bowl themselves too much and indirectly shorten their Test careers.\u201d \u201cSo far, this Test has been the cricketing equivalent of Mogadon,\u201d says Jo Pridmore. \u201cKill me now...!!\u201d In other news. it\u2019s been raining this morning in Bridgetown. Another unexpected blow for the travelling masses. The covers are off now, but the start has gone back by a quarter of an hour. \u201cTo be fair to Root,\u201d says Gary Naylor, \u201cif he had the two blokes to bowl at their own ends, he\u2019d look a world-beater.\u201d Marshall and Garner? In the immortal words of Kirsty MacColl, well so could anyone. \u201cHe has been more attacking with his field placings than is usual and I\u2019m not sure you can overrule your most experienced bowler when he says it\u2019s not worth a review.\u201d If you\u2019re the captain, you can overrule anyone. And there was nothing to lose with that review \u2013 at worst, it was going to be umpire\u2019s call, wasn\u2019t it? And here\u2019s John Starbuck, joining the campaign. \u201cYes, Root isn\u2019t up to it,\u201d he says, \u201cso why don\u2019t we take a leaf out of the Aussies\u2019 book and appoint a senior fast bowler to lead the team properly? Broad really fits the bill, as a good analyst of the game, willing to put in the hard yards but also swap the bowling round to suit both the players and the pitch. He also fields regularly at mid-off and would keep a close eye on all his bowlers. OK, his judgment of the DRS is over-enthusiastic, but a group of designated players told to watch out for it could be his consultation council, or he might take the umpires\u2019 DRS training course (there must be one). Plus he does the media well. And England need another fast bowler to cover all the crocks.\u201d An email! From Dean Kinsella. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to disagree with your assessment of Root\u2019s captaincy shortcomings,\u201d he says, \u201cespecially as he seems to a very affable chap and popular with the squad. But the next question is, inevitably, who do you replace him with? It\u2019s great to see some younger players being blooded in this series and maybe a candidate may arise from these in time. But I feel the \u2018reset\u2019 is not ready for Root and branch change.\u201d Ha. Well, Mike Brearley feels it\u2019s time for Stokes - and he was very good when he led a one-day B team to a whitewash against Pakistan last summer. Personally I would have had Stuart Broad, who is highly analytical and articulate and also has fire in the belly. Though he would have needed a lot of help with the reviews. Test cricket, as you know, is called that for a reason. It\u2019s the ultimate test for the players. And it can also be quite a test for the mere spectator. Picture the scene: you save up for years to follow England on tour. The Caribbean in March! Trip of a lifetime! And then you find you\u2019ve booked in for five days of tedium. After three days of this match, there have been 13 wickets. At that rate, it would take six more days to get close to a result. While Tests elsewhere often finish early, West Indies\u2019 groundsmen are hell-bent on bringing back the draw. In Antigua it was a reasonably tense one, with a result still possible as the final session began. In Barbados, we\u2019ll be lucky to get anywhere near that. It\u2019s not just the groundsmen. West Indies have mostly batted like it\u2019s 1959, Alex Lees did the same for England, and even Joe Root, usually so fluent, found the boundary only once every 22 balls. Dan Lawrence and Ben Stokes went three times as fast as that and deserve medals for it. But in the field England have been almost as passive as West Indies with the bat. Root had Jack Leach wheeling away for hours on end, doing the same thing, expecting a different outcome. After bowling Jofra Archer and Mark Wood into the ground, he is now working on Leach \u2013 who, as a spinner, is better able to cope, but still, it made no sense to hand him the new ball when he was knackered and there were three specialist seamers kicking their heels. As a captain, Root remains superb at one facet of the job (leading from the front), good at another (being an ambassador), and hopeless at the rest: picking the team, reading the pitch, having a plan, having a back-up plan, making things happen, running the show. A strong captain is always one step ahead, yet Root was so dopey with his bowling changes yesterday that some OBOers had time to work out what was needed, compose an email, wait for us writers to get through the inbox, and still be half an hour ahead of the game. Jos Buttler has copped some flak for his poor Ashes with the bat, but without his sharp eye and cool head, Root even struggles with the reviews. Watching England yesterday, you\u2019d never have known that Root had captained them in more Tests than anyone in their history. That said, hope springs eternal, and I\u2019ll be delighted if he goes out there today and makes this opinion look silly. Play starts at 2pm GMT: see you then.",

      "bodyText": "P&amp;O crossings between Liverpool and Dublin resumed on Saturday afternoon, two days after the ferry company suspended services when it sacked 800 staff and brought in replacement agency workers. Labour had called on the government to step in and halt any crossings, as ministers confirmed that all government contracts with the company were being reviewed. The Conservative party co-chair Oliver Dowden said P&amp;O Ferries and its owner, DP World, \u201cshould be in no doubt the government is considering very closely its relationship with them\u201d. \u201cAll of us feel, frankly, a revulsion at the kind of sharp practices from P&amp;O. There has been a complete lack of engagement, a lack of prior notice or indeed any empathy whatsoever for the workers,\u201d he told Times Radio. It came as the Sunday Times newspaper said it received a leaked memo apparently written by a senior Whitehall official that tried to \u201cjustify\u201d the mass redundancies, stating that \u201cwithout these decisions, an estimated 2,200 staff would likely lose their jobs\u201d. The memo, which is claimed to have been sent before 800 P&amp;O staff were told of their jobs being lost on Thursday, adds the changes \u201cwill align them with other companies in the market who have undertaken a large reduction in staff previously\u201d. The newspaper said it was \u201cwidely shared across government\u201d and recipients included the prime minister\u2019s private office while the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, is understood to have received a copy. After reports the firm intended to resume the Liverpool-Dublin route with its Norbank ship on Saturday, the shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, said: \u201cP&amp;O must not be allowed to sail today with replacement agency labour for loyal workers unjustly sacked this week. Strong words from the government are meaningless \u2013 they must step in and act.\u201d After at least one of the company\u2019s ferries was reported to have left Liverpool on Saturday morning, the Labour MP for Sefton Central, Bill Esterson, tweeted: \u201cLooks like one of the P&amp;O ships has left for Dublin. So who is the crew?\u201d Union calls for a boycott of P&amp;O were also backed by the Labour MP for East Hull, Karl Turner, who said he had for years been raising concerns about legal loopholes that meant the national minimum wage did not apply on international ferry routes, and called on the government to do more to punish the company for its actions. \u201cThe government should be telling every single person to boycott P&amp;O Ferries. That should be the message because we should not be allowing a pariah business to take advantage of British workers,\u201d he said on the BBC\u2019s Today programme, adding they should demand back the \u00a310m furlough money provided to the company during the pandemic. Labour has also urged the government to publish the legal advice it received on whether P&amp;O broke the law by making so many roles redundant without consultation, and asked if ministers were able to reverse the decision. \u201cWe are demanding the prime minister grants access to the legal advice the Department for Transport received on whether P&amp;O Ferry\u2019s actions constitute a breach of the law, and whether there are legal levers to get the decision reversed,\u201d said Keir Starmer. \u201cFull transparency is vital to prevent anyone else from being subjected to this appalling behaviour.\u201d Labour party analysis showed P&amp;O Ferries had received \u00a338.3m in government contracts since December 2018. In a new statement on Friday, P&amp;O Ferries said its decision was a \u201clast resort\u201d after concluding \u201cthe business wouldn\u2019t survive without fundamentally changed crewing arrangements\u201d. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said he had instructed the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) to carry out inspections of all P&amp;O vessels before they returned to sea to check the new crews the company had \u201crushed through\u201d were safe. Protesters were expected to march on the Tory party conference on Saturday for another day of demonstrations against the move, after protests at ports in London, Liverpool, Larne, Hull and Dover on Friday. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cIf the company has breached the law it must face severe consequences \u2013 not just a slap on the wrist. \u201cWhat happened at P&amp;O can never, ever be allowed to happen again. Ministers must urgently bring forward an employment bill to stop workers from being treated like disposable labour. The time for excuses is over.\u201d",

Brathwaite led the way for the hosts, not just turning his overnight 109 into 160 but also putting miles into the legs of his opponents.</p> <p>Brathwaite had also refreshed his own attack but inducing some late panic was never going to be easy on this surface. Though one scare followed when Zak Crawley reviewed an lbw decision on two, pinned in front by Kemar Roach only for Hawk-Eye to show it was missing leg stump by a whisker, he and Alex Lees survived 15 overs and will resume a possible charge for quick runs first thing.</p> <p>\u201cPressure can do funny things,\u201d replied Saqib Mahmood, fresh from figures of two for 58 from 27 overs on debut, when asked if England can claim 10 wickets on day five. \u201cI\u2019ve got my head around putting the bowling boots back on. It\u2019s been hard work so far but that is why we play the game.\u201d</p> <p>It had been a serious slog just to get to this point, with only Lara\u2019s scores of 375 (766 mins) in 1994 and 400 not out (778) 10 years on longer than Brathwaite\u2019s 710-minute innings among Caribbean epics. \u201cThis was the first time my mother has watched me play,\u201d revealed the Barbadian right-hander. \u201cScoring runs is always a great feeling and I\u2019m very happy to get a hundred at home.\u201d</p> <p>The soft-spoken West Indies captain prefers the road less travelled in these parts, having never played a professional game of Twenty20. His occupation is very much occupation and, after the hosts resumed on 288 for four, he ground down his opponents with a remarkable display of concentration that saw him notch up 400 dot balls out of the 489 he faced over two days.</p> <p>Over 200 of these had come out of the hand of Jack Leach and been repelled before the left-arm spinner eventually got one to pitch on middle, rag past a weary defensive shot and kiss the off stump before tea; the relief was palpable, with Root\u2019s attack having already heard the dreaded words \u201cthird new ball\u201d by this stage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73f6ba11234d631dc4c6cc8e79d1e51485a695e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73f6ba11234d631dc4c6cc8e79d1e51485a695e4/0_64_2820_1692/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Leach celebrates after finally dismissing Brathwaite\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Leach celebrates after finally dismissing Brathwaite.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ricardo Mazal\u00e1n/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brathwaite looked downbeat as he walked off but at 385 for seven in the 169th over it was a case of mission accomplished, having provided the backbone for his side\u2019s reply and doused the spirits of the travelling supporters to the extent that, when Sweet Caroline rung around the ground for the umpteenth time, they barely joined in.</p> <p>Their loudest cheers were arguably those that met the wickets claimed by Mahmood, recognising a wholehearted first outing and the agony he had felt when a maiden Test wicket was scrubbed off on the third day for a no-ball. After a soporific morning of 63 runs and one wicket \u2013 Ben Stokes removing nightwatchman Alzarri Joseph after 90 minutes of resistance \u2013 it finally came.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/19/its-in-the-blood-how-barbados-became-crickets-ultimate-hotspot\">\u2018It\u2019s in the blood\u2019: how Barbados became cricket\u2019s ultimate hotspot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Though the shot from Jason Holder after lunch was ugly, top-edging a slog, it still took a fine swirling catch from Matthew Fisher to get Mahmood off the mark. \u201cI\u2019m relieved more than anything,\u201d Mahmood later said. \u201cI felt the biggest criminal [after the no-ball]. When I got that one today, I had a little check there were no dramas.\u201d</p> <p>The satisfaction of a simpler second for Mahmood came when Veerasammy Permaul, the No 9, was trapped lbw but this was another day of toil for England\u2019s right-arm fast-mediums with no reverse swing owing to the early moisture on the ball.

      "bodyText": "Having spent the best part of two days in the dirt watching Kraigg Brathwaite chalk up the third longest innings by a West Indian after Brian Lara\u2019s two world records, it is over to England\u2019s batters to see whether they can somehow advance this second Test and force an unlikely win on the final day. The tourists will resume on 40 for no loss and a lead of 136 runs, West Indies having finally been bowled out for 411 from 187.5 overs after tea in reply to 507 for nine declared. Brathwaite led the way for the hosts, not just turning his overnight 109 into 160 but also putting miles into the legs of his opponents. Brathwaite had also refreshed his own attack but inducing some late panic was never going to be easy on this surface. Though one scare followed when Zak Crawley reviewed an lbw decision on two, pinned in front by Kemar Roach only for Hawk-Eye to show it was missing leg stump by a whisker, he and Alex Lees survived 15 overs and will resume a possible charge for quick runs first thing. \u201cPressure can do funny things,\u201d replied Saqib Mahmood, fresh from figures of two for 58 from 27 overs on debut, when asked if England can claim 10 wickets on day five. \u201cI\u2019ve got my head around putting the bowling boots back on. It\u2019s been hard work so far but that is why we play the game.\u201d It had been a serious slog just to get to this point, with only Lara\u2019s scores of 375 (766 mins) in 1994 and 400 not out (778) 10 years on longer than Brathwaite\u2019s 710-minute innings among Caribbean epics. \u201cThis was the first time my mother has watched me play,\u201d revealed the Barbadian right-hander. \u201cScoring runs is always a great feeling and I\u2019m very happy to get a hundred at home.\u201d The soft-spoken West Indies captain prefers the road less travelled in these parts, having never played a professional game of Twenty20. His occupation is very much occupation and, after the hosts resumed on 288 for four, he ground down his opponents with a remarkable display of concentration that saw him notch up 400 dot balls out of the 489 he faced over two days. Over 200 of these had come out of the hand of Jack Leach and been repelled before the left-arm spinner eventually got one to pitch on middle, rag past a weary defensive shot and kiss the off stump before tea; the relief was palpable, with Root\u2019s attack having already heard the dreaded words \u201cthird new ball\u201d by this stage. Brathwaite looked downbeat as he walked off but at 385 for seven in the 169th over it was a case of mission accomplished, having provided the backbone for his side\u2019s reply and doused the spirits of the travelling supporters to the extent that, when Sweet Caroline rung around the ground for the umpteenth time, they barely joined in. Their loudest cheers were arguably those that met the wickets claimed by Mahmood, recognising a wholehearted first outing and the agony he had felt when a maiden Test wicket was scrubbed off on the third day for a no-ball. After a soporific morning of 63 runs and one wicket \u2013 Ben Stokes removing nightwatchman Alzarri Joseph after 90 minutes of resistance \u2013 it finally came. Though the shot from Jason Holder after lunch was ugly, top-edging a slog, it still took a fine swirling catch from Matthew Fisher to get Mahmood off the mark. \u201cI\u2019m relieved more than anything,\u201d Mahmood later said. \u201cI felt the biggest criminal [after the no-ball]. When I got that one today, I had a little check there were no dramas.\u201d The satisfaction of a simpler second for Mahmood came when Veerasammy Permaul, the No 9, was trapped lbw but this was another day of toil for England\u2019s right-arm fast-mediums with no reverse swing owing to the early moisture on the ball. Fisher, the second debutant on show, was unable to add to his maiden Test wicket claimed way back on the second evening, Ben Stokes was worked the hardest and Chris Woakes was notably ignored for long periods by his captain. A wicket for Woakes eventually came as England picked off the West Indies tail, Roach given out lbw to a ball that was barely scratching leg stump. But it may be that the bowler England viewed as their attack leader on this tour has a breather in next week\u2019s third Test in Grenada unless the floodgates open in the fourth innings. Ollie Robinson and Craig Overton are the spare seamers but if another pitch like this one is prepared, England will consider a second spinner \u2013 and another debutant \u2013 in Matt Parkinson. Certainly Leach could do with some help, sending down 69.5 overs for figures of three for 118 that were solid enough but also reflected a lack of air on the ball at times and West Indies eschewing risk.

Eddie Jones has shuffled his pack and backs in the hope that something resembling an attack can materialise behind a forward effort that builds on last week\u2019s heroics. However, on selection alone his much trailed New England appears to revolve around booting the ball for Freddie Steward to attempt to outjump Gabin Villiere. We shall see how accurate that analysis is come full time.</p> <p>France had something of a fright in Cardiff last week, where their defence had to cover for Alldritt, Dupont and Ntamack - their fulcum - each simultaneously having their worst games of the Championship. This dip will not happen again and expect the France team to be firing and ready to put the final polish on their Best Team In The World plaque.</p> <p>But, England are perhaps the one team that can spring a performance from nowhere, as the 2019 All Blacks can attest. Here\u2019s hoping, as this match deserves to be a humdinger.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for your company tonight and throughout the tournament, make sure you join us for the Women\u2019s Six Nations from next week. Bye. Well, a good game to bring about an outstanding achievement for France. Here\u2019s Rob Kitson\u2019s full report. Raphael Ibanez is here. \u201cWe are very lucky to have fantastic football players. Fair play to England, they tried to break our defence, but our play and tactics won us the game. We need to keep our feet on the ground and there\u2019s more to come, we can still improve\u201d He\u2019s right. The trophy is presented to France and it\u2019s hoisted high as the pyrotechnics explode in the background. The stadium is then plunged into darkness as \u201cFreed From Desire\u201d booms out and France parties like it\u2019s 1996. I bet it reeks of Joop! in there. Losing captain, Courtney Lawes, is talking to Martin Bayfield. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty disappointed, we had them in fitness but we failed to capitalise but that\u2019s on us. It\u2019s hard to say what\u2019s missing so soon after the game, we\u2019ll go away and have a look. I thought there were points where we had them, but it wasn\u2019t to be, we didn\u2019t deliver\u201d Lawes clearly hurting there, but I don\u2019t agree England \u201chad\u201d France at any point in that game, or certainly not to a level that looked likely to change the result. Thibault Flament, Grand Slam winning sub is here: \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing feeling, I\u2019m just so happy for the team. We knew it was going to be a tough game; we had some good set piece and defence and they managed to come back in second half but we did it. The feeling on the final whistle was so good, but there\u2019s still a lot to be done.\u201d England were better tonight than at any other time in the tournament, particularly in the third quarter of the match, but the gulf between them and France was obvious throughout. Question is, do Eddie Jones\u2019s squad have the talent to develop into something on a par before RWC2023? I feel it\u2019s a no. This France side could be one for the ages, Carter/McCaw/Read vintage All Blacks level good. Antoine Dupont is in tears, the crowd are jubilant, the tricolor disco lights are flashing and all the smiles are wide. In the end, it was all very comfortable for what is becoming a very special team. 80 mins. FRANCE WIN THE GRAND SLAM FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 2010!! 78 mins. France are now accepting that England will have the ball for the remainder of the game and are in their full masterful containing defence mode: fanning out wide, organising themselves and covering everything England throw at them. It\u2019s been a consummate performance in the face of the visitors playing some of their best rugby of the tournament in the second half. 76 mins. Marchant is again lively as England apply some pressure in the France 22, but Villiere nips in to snaffle a kick from under the nose of Steward to allow France to clear. On the return, the ball comes left and Smith nearly finds Daly out wide. George Ford is on for Furbank Maxime Lucu replaces Dupont Thomas Ramos for Jaminet. 74 mins. Time is ticking away from England as Jaminet boots an utter monster of a clearance from his own 22 into touch on the England 10m line. England win possession from the lineout and have some carries around halfway before kicking it back to France. 72 mins. The ball is caught and driven at the lineout by England. Dombrandt comes on a huge diagonal run but is wrapped up tight by a number of French tacklers and can\u2019t get the ball down. Jaminet bangs the drop-out deep and England knock-on as they run possession back. Cameron Woki is replaced by Thibault Flament. Francois Cros on for Dylan Cretin. 70 mins. France have made a great deal more tackles in this game than England (140 to 107) and you have to wonder if it\u2019s now starting to tell as les Bleus are caught offside on the drive from the lineout. England have another lineout on the France 5m line. 68 mins. England get a nudge on in the scrum that forces Gros to turn in. Smith finds a touch but it\u2019s not as close to the France line as it perhaps should have been. 66 mins. More England subs. Alex Dombrandt is on for Sam Underhill Harry Randall for Ben Youngs Joe Marler for Ellis Genge 65 mins. Dupont\u2019s his latest trick being a perfect box-kick that puts Daly in all sorts of trouble and forces him to fumble into touch. On the next possession, Jaminet attempts a drop goal from too far out that he was in position to attempt. It doesn\u2019t go well. 62 mins Ollie Chessum has replaced Nick Isiekwe for England 61 mins. The scrum takes close to an eon to complete, which suits France after England\u2019s counter-punches so far this half. Eventually it\u2019s out and France have some real phases for the first time this half. They work it smoothly left and right before Alldritt punches a hole and pops to the ever-present Dupont on his shoulder to run in from twenty metres. Jaminet slots the two. 57 mins. Mauvaka and Woki link up to break away from a maul and put France in England half. They are working carries sort arond the ruck, but it\u2019s so tight in there Ref Peyper ends up in a player sandwich and has no choice but to blow up and give France a scrum on the England 10m line 55 mins. Freddie Steward, growing into the game, gathers his own kick after chasing it a full forty metres. This puts England back on the attack in the 22 and they are playing with tempo and testing the France defence, but Underhill ends up isolated and is pinged for holding on. Mohammad Haouas is on for Atonio 53 mins. From a lineout England find Marchant again, who after last time is met by a French welcoming committee. Smith decides it\u2019s best to pin France back in their 22 and make them kick out, which they duly do. France decide it\u2019s time for some subs. Romain Taofifenua replaces Paul Willemse Jean-Baptiste Gros is on for Cyril Baille Peato Mauvaka for Julien Marchand England have replaced Will Stuart with Kyle Sinckler 48 mins. Joe Marchant cuts a lovely angle again and slices through the France line. Penaud drags him down but England recycle quickly to Smith and Daly who finds Steward out wide who steps inside a tackler to score in the corner. Smith kicks a beautiful conversion to end a very decent opening to the second half for England. 47 mins. France win the scrum and have a couple of short carries before Dupont whams it clear. Elliot Daly runs it back before some territorial kicking exchanges commence, which come to an end when Dupont is offside on one of the chases in the England half. 44 mins. George throws it short and low to the front and France stop it at source but the visitors manage to recycle it. The carries start from the England forwards but Underhill drops the ball five metres out under significant defensive pressure. 42 mins. England have a decent start after Marchand knocks on from the kick-off and they have a few phases that force France offside. Smith puts in in the corner for the England pack to have go at a catch and drive. 40 mins. Marcus Smith hoists it high and France are forty minutes from a Grand Slam. Half time musings. France are a much better rugby team than England. That\u2019s it PEEEEEEEEP! That\u2019s the end of the half 40 mins. France get the ball away on the left, with Villiere prominent again and this time feeding Jelonch lurking on the touchline. The backrow is stopped short, but the ball is worked all the way right, then left again to Ntamack who is halted by a desperate tackle from Genge. Francois Cros grabs the ball at the back of the ruck and jumps over to score with an outstretched arm. Jaminet converts. 37 mins. Itoje has arrived in the game via a fantastic rip in the middle of the park that puts England immediately on the attack in the France half. They work it left but Cretin chops down Slade and Fickou follows up for an easy as you like turnover and England\u2019s clearout was non-existent. 35 mins. France have a hold-hold-push in the scrum and the third part of that causes England\u2019s pack to concertina into an ugly mess. Jaminet looks at it, calculates it\u2019s 5o-odd metres and takes it on. He has the distance, but it pulls left. 32 mins. Marcus Smith does his goose-step from a kick return and fixes the defence before feeding Steward who gets around Danty before Villiere turns and hauls the England wing down. The ball is not secure and spills forward at the ruck, giving a scrum to France on halfway. 30 mins. Joe Marchant has a decent carry that puts England into the France half and a few phases later France are offside. Smith adds another three from the penalty. 27 mins. In the latest oddity from England, Furbank completely misjudges a kick in the air and ends up volleying back up the field to Jaminet. The France fullback steps Furbank on the return but his pass to Villiere is a poor one, down by his knees and the winger can\u2019t gather it. I count that as five passes from France that haven\u2019t gone to hand when England were in all sorts of trouble. When these start to stick it will be murder. 25 mins. England\u2019s attack is a strange beast at present; some nippy early phases that show some promise are slowed down around phase four by Youngs, then Smith hoinks it up in the air for Jaminet to claim. If they trusted playing with speed from each ruck it would look much better. Jack Nowell is injured after his latest kick-chase and is replaced by Elliot Daly. 23 mins. Marchand has a busy carry off the back of a maul and then it\u2019s followed by equally strong carries from Baille and Jelonch. England are on the back foot in their own 22 as Alldritt tries to force and offload to Dupont, but it was never on and the France captains spills it. But, this was done on an offside advantage and so Jaminet extends the lead from the tee. 20 mins. Youngs hoists up a box kick following a Sam Simmonds carry from the kick-off and as Jaminet rises to claim it he\u2019s catherine wheeled in the air by Nowell running underneath him. The ref is looking at whether Dupont nudges Nowell into Jaminet, if he did this could save the England man from a red card. Ref Peyper says it\u2019s actually a penalty to England for obstruction as Dupont sort of blocked Nowell. I believe that\u2019s a very generous decision by the ref. 19 mins. Uini Atonio is off his feet at the ruck and it gives Smith a chance from 30 metres out, bang in front that he tees up and slots with little trouble. 16 mins. Straight off the lineout it\u2019s another beautiful pattern from France, each pass feinting the ball away from the England tacklers. It finds Villiere out left who is hoisted down, but Ntamack sends it all the way right with a huge bouncing pass to Fickou who is over in the corner. A wonderful, dynamic, ranging and rampaging try. Jaminet misses the conversion. 13 mins. Half a dozen kicks back and forth end as Nowell decides to have a carry, but again Alldritt clamps on win a penalty. On the advantage France go wide and Danty is clear and through the line but his pass to find Penaud is another one that is fumbled. We\u2019ll go back for the penalty. 10 mins. Some more and better zip from England in possession works some phases up the right and again it\u2019s followed by a cross-kick from Smith towards Steward in the France half. It\u2019s claimed by the England winger, but in the next tackle Danty clamps on win a penalty for the home team. 8 mins. England fold in the scrum and Jaminet tees it up and slots it from 35 metres. 6 mins. First penalty of the game is France\u2019s after Alldritt clamps on Nowell out wide to force a holding on infringement. From the first phase off the top of the lineout, it\u2019s a lovely pattern from les Bleus, bringing Penaud into midfield but his pop pass to Fickou goes to ground. That move had torn the England midfield defence asunder if the ball had stuck in Fickou\u2019s hands. 4 mins. We\u2019ve alredy seen four kicks from England: a couple of high ones, a grubber abd the latest - a cross kick from Smith towards Steward on the right wing. None have come off thus far, but the tactical tone is set. 3 mins. Jaminet confidently claims his first kick under pressure but as the ball is recycled right there\u2019s an unforced handling error from the nervous fingers of Jelonch. First scrum of the match is a solid one for England, but Marcus Smith\u2019s grubber is taken by Jaminet and France can clear. 1 min. The ball somehow manages to leave Romain Ntamack\u2019s foot without being stopped dead by the wall of incredible noise in the Stade De France and we are underway. Here come the teams. The lights are out in the stadium, save for some red, white and blue disco LED\u2019s. The crowd light up their phones and it\u2019s quite the picture as both sets of players jog onto the pitch. It\u2019s incredibly loud and raucous then a hush descends while the Ukraine flag is hoisted over the pitch, before applause breaks out. A sober reminder that sport is a wonderful, powerful, moving part of our lives but it\u2019s not everything. \u201cYes Lee, I am very much excited!\u201d says a fired up Elisabeth Guillerm, \u201cBut being French, I would say that it\u2019s an understatement! Allez les Bleus!\u201d You\u2019ve certainly waited long enough for this chance of the big one, Elisabeth. \u201cAs Italy showed earlier, underdogs can spring surprises.\u201d says Tim Joyce, \u201cI\u2019m just not sure that surprise is something England can come up with. France looked nailed on for this from the first round, but we can always hope.\u201d Well, you might as well Tim. Pre match reading Jonathan Liew has been considering Fabien Galthi\u00e9\u2019s influence on this young France squad. \u201cFrance have spent the last two years in a state of high stress because that is simply the nature of playing under Galthi\u00e9: a restless, ruthless and divisive coach whose perfectionism, according to those who have played under him, verges on obsession\u201d Read more here: Are we excited?

Max Malins is out of the team, replaced by George Furbank. The Northampton fullback slots into fifteen, meaning Freddie Steward, the Leicester fullback and one of England\u2019s consistent and dependable performers is pushed to the wing. Elsewhere in the backs Ben Youngs regains the starting 9 jersey from Harry Randall. Will Stuart starts at prop after a powerful showing in the second half vs Ireland, Sam Underhill returns to the back row after his long injury layoff and Nick Isiekwe replaces the banned Charlie Ewels. For France, it\u2019s simple as you like, as the world class Damian Penaud returns to the wing and everything else pretty much remains the same.

Welcome to Paris, where after the final whistle on a bonus point Ireland win in Dublin it\u2019s Grand Slam or bust for France. On recent outings and form this should be a very simple prediction, as Fabien Galthie\u2019s squad simply need to play as they have for 75% of this tournament and a Grand Slam is theirs. Hoping to buck the trend are England, coming off the back of a brave but again blunt performance in the Ireland loss. Eddie Jones has shuffled his pack and backs in the hope that something resembling an attack can materialise behind a forward effort that builds on last week\u2019s heroics. However, on selection alone his much trailed New England appears to revolve around booting the ball for Freddie Steward to attempt to outjump Gabin Villiere. We shall see how accurate that analysis is come full time. France had something of a fright in Cardiff last week, where their defence had to cover for Alldritt, Dupont and Ntamack - their fulcum - each simultaneously having their worst games of the Championship. This dip will not happen again and expect the France team to be firing and ready to put the final polish on their Best Team In The World plaque. But, England are perhaps the one team that can spring a performance from nowhere, as the 2019 All Blacks can attest. Here\u2019s hoping, as this match deserves to be a humdinger.",

Another neighbour, who arrived first at the scene, said his grandmother was trying to drive them both to safety. He had been hit in the eye; she had kept going for nearly two miles after being shot, trying to reach a village outside town \u2013 perhaps in shock, or in the vain hope of reaching medics.</p> \n<p>An ambulance had taken her to hospital, but it was too late for the young man. Even so early in the war, medics had no space in their vehicles for the dead, so the body was left behind for burial.</p> \n<p>In the violent days that followed, Lysovysk, a former construction worker, continued to document how the war was unfolding around him.</p> \n<p>Refugees escaping occupied areas have repeatedly described Russian soldiers shooting at their cars, even when marked with white flags or carrying signs saying \u201cchildren\u201d, and seeing abandoned vehicles with bodies inside. One video he took from a motorway outside town captures apparent evidence of a massacre. Seven civilian cars, riddled with bullet holes, have been abandoned beside the road. In one dark red Lada, keys still lie on the bloodstained seats, although all the dead or injured occupants had been taken away.</p> \n<p>As the battle worsened, food supplies began to run out. Eduard filmed workers from the office of mayor Yuriy Prylypko giving jars of vegetables, potatoes and other food to trapped residents, and asked why they were not distributing guns instead so that residents could fight. \u201cThey told me the Russians had taken over the national guard base inside Hostomel where all the guns were stored, and so there were no weapons to give out.\u201d Five days later, Prylypko was shot dead by the invaders while handing out bread to civilians.</p> \n<p>On 3 March, Russian tanks rolled into town and soldiers began setting up base in a construction site near the Lysovysks\u2019 home. That night they moved into the apartment block.</p> \n<p>Screenshots from CCTV show men in military camouflage milling in the hallway, and the couple saw the group place something outside their door, which they feared was a tripwire.</p> \n<p>Their home was on the ground floor, so they decided to climb over their balconies the next morning to escape to a bomb shelter across the street. When daylight returned, Lysovysk first helped his 59-year-old wife to the bomb shelter, and went back for an elderly neighbour on the same floor.</p> \n<p>With both rescues complete, he took a moment outside the shelter to make a phone call, and as he stood still the sniper pulled his trigger. \u201cIt hit me, and my leg just collapsed out to the side. It looked like I had two knees,\u201d said Lysovysk, speaking from his hospital bed in Bila Tservka, a city south of Kyiv that has been spared intense fighting.</p> \n<p>He was taken there for treatment because his injuries are so complex and doctors say he will need multiple surgeries to regain use of his leg; the bone was shattered.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe shouted and fell,\u201d said Iryna Lysovysk, who was standing beside him. \u201cWe only just managed to drag him into the shelter.\u201d The crowd inside helped rip up sheets to make a tourniquet and dress the wound. He later bound it with a makeshift splint, to keep the leg straight, and the couple sent messages to friends, asking for an ambulance because they couldn\u2019t get through to emergency services.</p> \n<p>Then they turned off their mobiles and hid them behind jars of pickled vegetables, after they were warned by people in the basement that the Russians had been confiscating people\u2019s phones.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey took some people\u2019s phones and in other cases, just ripped the sim cards out,\u201d Iryna Lysovysk said.</p> \n<p>When the Russian soldiers came, Lysovysk was lying on the floor, clearly immobile and in terrible pain, but the men kept their fingers on their triggers. \u201cIt was like they were afraid of me,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey said, \u2018it wasn\u2019t us who shot you, it was a Ukrainian sniper\u2019, but I said, \u2018Tell me where they are?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>In over a week of fighting the Lysovsks had only once seen a small detachment of six soldiers in Ukrainian uniform. \u201cI had seen the (Russian) sniper eye to eye, 20m away from us, he was in the next apartment block over, the construction block.\u201d</p> \n<p>On 9 March, two days after the mayor was shot, Hostomel\u2019s residents were finally told they could evacuate through a humanitarian corridor; most went on foot to a collection point.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for your company here, you can now step over and join me again for the big finale in Paris. Player of the Match, Dan Sheehan, is chatting on the telly. \u201cThe Triple Crown is great for us and it\u2019s good to have it back. We\u2019ve got plenty more in us, but it\u2019s great to get where we\u2019ve got and the crowd has given us a huge rise for every game.\u201d Ireland have done exactly what was required to put maximum pressure on France, while Scotland end the tournament with a dissonant whimper. There\u2019ll be much reckoning to come for Gregor Townsend, I fancy. IRELAND WIN WITH A BONUS POINT! Over to you, Les Bleus. 80 mins. Ireland drive from the lineout and release James Lowe. He\u2019s held up short, but he offloads to replacement Conor Murray who uses his strength to drive over through Graham and Nel. Sexton can\u2019t put the icing on the cake from the tee. 78 mins. Ben White has a rather obvious deliberate knock on and is marched from the field. 76 mins. The game has become flabby with the weight of its meh-ness at this stage. Ireland have lost shape and dynamism with the sheer number of replacements, while Scotland are forcing. The result is not much play happening, but Ireland have another chance as they threaten the Scottish 22 again. 73 mins. The ball is won solidly and Scotland are inching forward with carries before Nel is penalised for pre-latching and then sealing off. He compounds this by then backchatting and losing a further ten metres. Joey Carbery is on for Hugo Keenan as Ireland continue to pursue the bonus point. 71 mins. Russell runs to the line and feeds a late pop to Bennett who is away before Keenan tackles him. The breakdown is a mess, however, and Scotland will attack from a lineout from the resulting penalty. 68 mins. Some territorial kicking breaks out and Finn Russell\u2019s first contribution is to boom the ball down the middle and into the Irish in-goal. Sexton drops it out from under the posts and Scotland are back on the attack before more imprecision sees the ball go to ground between Kinghorn and Russell. Finlay Bealham replaces Tadhg Furlong 66 mins. Scotland go wide from the lineout, with Kinghorn seeing an overlap. He throws a long one towards Mark Bennett but Mack Hansen makes a brilliant defensive decision by rushing out and shutting down Bennett, ball and all. Great defensive read. Finn Russell is on for Chris Harris. That will see Kinghorn move to inside centre and Bennett to 13. 64 mins. In search of the bonus point fourth try Ireland are working phases on halfway, but they can\u2019t prevent Alan Dell winning a holding on penalty. Hogg finds a huge touch, deep in Ireland territory. 62 mins. Scotland are starting to fling the ball about now, feeling a sense of desperation seeping in. Hamish Watson has a dart out wide but his offload goes to ground. Iain Henderson is replaced by Kieran Treadwell Matt Fagerson is off for Josh Bayliss Dan Sheehan gives way for Rob Herring. Scotland subs Ali Price is replaced by Ben White Sam Johnson leaves for Mark Bennett. 60 mins. Ireland are in the 22 and driving repeatedly through the forwards. Scotland rack up three penalties for offside, all of which are having advantage played before Van Der Flier comes on a good angle to take the ball short off Gibson-Park and score despite the attention of Scottish tacklers. Sexton converts. 58 mins. It\u2019s another frustrating passage of play for Ireland as Scotland get amongst their possession and manage to clear. But here come Ireland again, running it back into the Scottish 22. 55 mins. Ireland have a big shove in the scrum on the Scotland 22 and win a penalty as the visiting pack crumbles. It\u2019s sent to the corner but Fagerson nicks the lineout at the tail before Beirne then charges down a clearing kick. It\u2019s all a bit breathless and Matt Fagerson decides this nonsense must stop and choke tackles Sexton to win a scrum. But, the rest of his pack seem to like the nonsense and can\u2019t hold themselves up under pressure again. Another Ireland penalty coming and it\u2019s sent to the corner once more. Bundee Aki is replaced by Robbie Henshaw. 52 mins. Ireland subs. Dave Kilcoyne for Cian Healy and Peter O\u2019Mahony for Jack Conan 51 mins. Meanwhile back in play, Ireland try to feed Lowe while up flat to the tackle line, but there\u2019s no space and he\u2019s rushed into fumbling by the Scotland defence. There\u2019s a sniff of a counter attack but nothing comes of it. Sam Skinner is on for Grant Gilchrist Fraser Brown replaces George Turner The clock is off as the ref and TMO have a look as a possible leading elbow in the carry by Schoeman. They have a good old look and decide it was a \u201cbrace and push\u201d type of movement rather than a run and forearm smash job. Hmm, not sure I agree with that. Stuart Hogg will be happy though as it distracted for a while from his absolutely honking cock-up. 48 mins. Tadhg Beirne is pinged for messing with Johnny Gray in the lineout and Hogg can find a good touch in the Ireland half. Kinghorn is calling the shots in midfield and sprays a pass wide to Steyn on the left side. Scotland are up to 9 phases Hogg ignores a three on one out right to go for the corner himself and fails to make it as he\u2019s bundled into touch. It was a decent covering tackle, but that is an unforgivably poor decision by the Captain to ignore his support. 43 mins. Two early penalties for the Ireland, the second of which is tapped quickly by Gibson-Park and he\u2019s away into the Scotland 22. The ball is kept alive by a remarkable one-handed fling behind his head by Hansen on the right touchline and the Irish settle in for some carries. Gibson-Park then tickles a kick into the in-goal, but Graham is first to it. 40 mins. Hogg lumps one up in the air and we\u2019re back in the game. Half time musings A frenetic start gave way to something more predictable as Ireland had the most of the middle third of the half before Scotland evened things up late on. However, while the territory and possession stats are fairly evenly matched, there is something your eyes tells you that the data won\u2019t: Ireland just look that little bit stronger - as the score line is showing. However, the home scrum looked to be creaking again in the final set-piece before the half, and Scotland are making metres especially when they bring Graham into play. Kinghorn also looks to be shepherding them well in possession. The half-time reset probably came at the right time for Ireland, expect them to use it well. 40 mins. Scotland have a penalty from a huge push in the 5m scrum that forces and Ireland fold. The ball is put off the field to end the opening forty. 38 mins. Just as Scotland get a toe-hold, Tadhg Furlong pulls it away by clamping on Johnny Gray after the restart to win a penalty for Scotland holding on. But the men in blue fight hard on the next defensive set and Grant Gilchrist wins it back. 36 mins. A turnover for Scotland is fed right to Graham and he is around van Der Flier and into the Irish 22. Kinghorn is calling for heavy carries from the forwards and it\u2019s taken them up to within metres of the line before Schoeman does a little dummies then muscles over from a few metres. There\u2019s a hint of double movement but not more as far as Ref Wayne Barnes is concerned. The try is given and Kinghorn horribly slices the conversion wide. 31 mins. Scotland have the ball, and Sam Johnson cuts a nice out-to-in line to carry over halfway but Ireland regroup and force slow ball, leaving Ali Price with little choice but to box kick to nothing. 28 mins. Dan Sheehan, who has been so good in the loose all tournament, has another crunching and rapid carry off the back of a ruck and up to the Scotland line. A couple of phases later Cian Healy forces over from inches. Sexton has an easy conversion 26 mins. Henderson claims a flying lineout catch one-handed in the Scotland half. The ball goes right and a chip over the top is chased by Hansen, but Rory Darge is alive to it and has peeled off the lineout to cover in backfield on his own line. But Ireland have it back and are still on the attack. 23 mins. Scotland win a clean lineout on the Ireland 22, but as they attempt one of their patented fancy first phase moves the timing is a little off and Ali Price knocks on. That\u2019s frustrating for Townsend\u2019s men, as it was an opportunity to put some control into their part of the game for the first time in a while. 21 mins. Not a great couple of minutes for D\u2019Arcy Graham. First, he clatters into James Lowe when chasing a kick to give away a penalty, then he nearly fumbles a simple catch from a kick in his 22 and slices his own touchfinder horribly in the subsequent panic. 18 mins. It\u2019s a simple catch and drive that Sheehan grounds after he peels off the back of the maul. Easy as you like and Sexton adds the two. 16 mins. The last few minutes has seen Ireland start to show their dominance and this continues as they almost get Lowe away again on the left in the Scotland half. The visiting defence infringe and do so again by not being ten metres when the first penalty is tapped. Ireland can do nothing with the advantage and so send it to the corner for a 5m lineout. 14 mins. Scotland leave anenormous gap on the left of their 22 and it\u2019s all the invitation Sexton needs to drive the ball into touch for a 50:22. The catch and drive by Ireland from the lineout is over the line, but the sheer number of bodies won\u2019t allow it to be grounded. Scotland will drop-out from under the posts. 12 min. The Scottish lineout comes to nought as Turner overthrows Johnny Gray, the ball kissing the tips of his fingers on its way to being turned over to Ireland. Some kicking back and forth ensues before Jamison Gibson Park snipes around the ruck on halfway and chips over Hogg, but loses the foot race with the Scotland fullback who gathers it and gets enough room to boot it clear. 9 mins. What could be described as normal phased rugby breaks out around the halfway line with both teams having a minute or so of possession. Scotland, the latest to have the ball, cause the Ireland defence to drift offside and Hogg sends the kick up to the Irish 22 for a lineout. 6 mins. OK, so it seems everyone has decided this game is going to be silly, this time it\u2019s prop Pierre Schoeman picking and going into open ground from the base of a ruck. He sprints 30 metres into the Ireland 22, but the recycled possession is passed forward by Harris. 4 mins. It\u2019s Ireland\u2019s turn to have a go from their near their own line with Ringrose finding Lowe on the left touchline for the winger to boom the ball forward and deep into Scottish territory. Hogg covers. 2 mins. D\u2019Arcy Graham takes the ball deep in his own 22 and goes for it, gassing past Bundee Aki and through the line before he\u2019s stopped by Hugo Keenan up from full back. The ball is scrappy and Ireland almost mount a counter attack of their own but nothing comes of it. 1 min. Johnny Sexton gets us underway with a long, high drop. Matt Fagerson carries a short return before Ali Price clears via a box kick. The teams are on their way out. Scotland, led by a thin-lipped and serious looking Stuart Hogg, are followed by Johnny Sexton and his men in green. Anthems next, then it\u2019ll be kick-off time.

For all their talent, the kinda green Les Bleus have not felt the hand of history trembling on their shoulder yet. Ireland will want to make sure they are shaking to the point of nausea come kick off later. If Ireland win this with a not improbable try bonus point, this would put them three up on France in the table; meaning only a home win in Paris can realistically see Ireland lose the Championship. (There are some possible draw-plus-try-bonus-point shenanigans that may bring it down to points difference, but let\u2019s try and deal with absolutes until we have no choice not to, shall we?) But what of Scotland? It\u2019s been a pretty depressing tournament all told, with this week\u2019s latest unwelcome disquiet in the form of players - including Stuart Hogg and Finn Russell - breaking team protocol to get late-night bevvied. Gregor Townsend will not want that scenario to be the lasting memory of a mediocre tournament and a win here would allow this, unlike his players, to be put firmly to bed.",

This league has gone, but others needn\u2019t do the same. Besides, the cl\u00e1sico always has a meaning beyond the maths. Carlo Ancelotti was asked how his team could possibly lose the league now that they had moved 10 points clear with 10 games to go. \u201cHow can you lose a European Cup final when you\u2019re 3-0 up?\u201d the manager of Milan in 2005 replied. He knows, and so does Xavi. Yet the Barcelona manager\u2019s response to a similar question contained an idea that can at least be entertained now, the hope of a cl\u00e1sico that is competitive again. \u201cWe can\u2019t be very optimistic about the league: Real Madrid would have to lose three or four and they haven\u2019t all season,\u201d he said. \u201cQuite honestly, It\u2019s very difficult \u2013 even if we win at the Bernab\u00e9u.\u201d",

To hear Guardiola, an accomplished No 6 from the Barcelona school of schemers, be so unequivocal regarding the desire for a prolific scorer can jar. Then there is the empirical evidence the table shows: City are first, their 68 goals ranking second only to Liverpool who also lack a consistently scoring No 9.</p> \n<p>Roberto Firmino is the regular there but the Brazilian\u2019s league returns are 12, nine and nine in the past three seasons, with five after 16 appearances this term (though he has been injured).</p> \n<p>They do, though, have Mo Salah \u2013 the Golden Boot winner of 2016-17, who registered 22, 19 and 22 in the following campaigns and has 20 in this \u2013 plus the support acts of Sadio Man\u00e9 (12 this season, 11, 18 and 22 in the previous three) and Diogo Jota (13 and nine, in the current and last terms).</p> \n<p>City have been the kings of sharing goals around. In Guardiola\u2019s first three seasons the now departed Sergio Ag\u00fcero hit 20, 21, and 21. The latter two tallies were accumulated in championship-winning XIs: the first featured contributions from Sterling (18), Jesus (13) and Leroy San\u00e9 (10). In the second, Sterling (17) and San\u00e9 (10) were to the fore, while Bernardo Silva, Riyad Mahrez and Jesus all chipped in with seven. This season Sterling and Mahrez have 10 apiece, Kevin De Bruyne nine, Phil Foden and Silva seven each.</p> \n<p>Ag\u00fcero\u2019s exit last summer left a club-record 260-goal hole in the forward line.

      "bodyText": "A question: when will a Manchester City No 9 truly be a No 9 and not a false one, as when Pep Guardiola fields Bernardo Silva, Raheem Sterling, Jack Grealish, or Gabriel Jesus to \u201clead\u201d the line? Answer: when Erling Haaland or another recognised centre-forward targeted by the manager is signed in the summer. Those named above in Guardiola\u2019s current squad operate as the supposed lone striker, but in his carousel of revolving positions any attack-minded player is informed to float into an advanced central berth and dizzy opponents. In this mode City are the piquant entertainers who claimed last term\u2019s Premier League with no natural No 9 for most of the campaign and whose title defence this season will not feature one at all. City are the leaders, by a point from Liverpool, with nine matches left. They are at Southampton on Sunday in the FA Cup quarter-finals and were drawn against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid on Friday in the Champions League last eight as they chase a Treble he believes is possible if particularly tough to achieve. Yet Guardiola\u2019s striker-less wonders still require an elite one, he insists, so when the next window opens the club will resume a chase that failed last summer to land Harry Kane. The new head of the list is Haaland. After Monday\u2019s stumble at Crystal Palace \u2013 0-0, chances spurned \u2013 Guardiola can expect a) to be posed more questions about the Borussia Dortmund man; and b) to hear from the told-you-so brigade about how trying to be champions again with no 20-goal-a-season marksman was always going to be folly. Guardiola, a shrewd operator, has already preempted these scenarios, saying he gets \u201ckilled\u201d for the latter whenever points are dropped and, regarding the former, via a mantra heard in several media briefings that \u201cManchester City definitely need a striker\u201d. This is a novel discourse for a manager who adores a midfielder. To hear Guardiola, an accomplished No 6 from the Barcelona school of schemers, be so unequivocal regarding the desire for a prolific scorer can jar. Then there is the empirical evidence the table shows: City are first, their 68 goals ranking second only to Liverpool who also lack a consistently scoring No 9. Roberto Firmino is the regular there but the Brazilian\u2019s league returns are 12, nine and nine in the past three seasons, with five after 16 appearances this term (though he has been injured). They do, though, have Mo Salah \u2013 the Golden Boot winner of 2016-17, who registered 22, 19 and 22 in the following campaigns and has 20 in this \u2013 plus the support acts of Sadio Man\u00e9 (12 this season, 11, 18 and 22 in the previous three) and Diogo Jota (13 and nine, in the current and last terms). City have been the kings of sharing goals around. In Guardiola\u2019s first three seasons the now departed Sergio Ag\u00fcero hit 20, 21, and 21. The latter two tallies were accumulated in championship-winning XIs: the first featured contributions from Sterling (18), Jesus (13) and Leroy San\u00e9 (10). In the second, Sterling (17) and San\u00e9 (10) were to the fore, while Bernardo Silva, Riyad Mahrez and Jesus all chipped in with seven. This season Sterling and Mahrez have 10 apiece, Kevin De Bruyne nine, Phil Foden and Silva seven each. Ag\u00fcero\u2019s exit last summer left a club-record 260-goal hole in the forward line. This is why first Kane was pursued and now Haaland. The Norwegian\u2019s numbers for Dortmund: 16 in 15 Bundesliga appearances, six assists; 23 strikes in 22 appearances in all competitions, including three in three Champions League outings. Overall career statistics: 80 in 80 for Dortmund, 20 in 20 for Molde, 29 in 27 for Salzburg, and 12 in 15 for Norway, the zero in 16 for his first club, Bryne, long forgotten. This record is one reason why Guardiola is keen to sign the 21-year-old: imagine how many more goals City would score with Haaland in the XI. But another relates to City\u2019s defence and how the opposition try to unlock it. Here, think of the home reverses to Palace (2-0) and Tottenham (3-2), plus myriad matches where Guardiola\u2019s high-lying rearguard has been vulnerable to raids launched over the top or along the sides. The tactic requires a low block that is tricky for City to break down. In most contests this is managed by a kind of speedy five-a-side play that incorporates passing down the wings and incisive penalty area forays. When, though, this is failing, Guardiola wants a dedicated target-man to offer variation. \u201cIf we have a striker, we play in a different way but if you don\u2019t have it you have to adapt with the quality [abilities] that we have,\u201d he says. What Haaland \u2013 or any No 9 \u2013 must also possess is an ability to be fluid, to understand and execute City\u2019s constant off-the-front patterns. The Norwegian has this, as was illustrated by Marco Reus\u2019s strike in last season\u2019s 2-1 Champions League defeat at City: Haaland dropped into a pocket to become a de facto No 10 who created the chance. So in the pursuit of Haaland (or anyone else) Guardiola wants to recruit yet another smart-brained, pass-and-move footballer, but one who adds an Ag\u00fcero-like proven eye for goal to a squad already bristling with talent. It sounds like a frightening prospect for City\u2019s opponents. They are pretty scared already.",

But the effort was huge, and we never let Middlesbrough get a foot back into the door. We came from a period with a lot of matches in a short period of time, and again you\u2019re focused and get away with a deserved win, so I\u2019m very happy.</p> <p>I\u2019m very impressed and I\u2019m delighted [with our form]. We accepted the situation, because we did not cause it and nothing we can do can change it. So it\u2019s not in our hands but what is in our hands is to stay focused. It\u2019s a responsibility if you have such a talent and are privileged to play football for a profession. This is what we do and the culture in the club helps to support everybody, and it\u2019s very good at the moment.</p> <p>We saw they were brave. We were totally aware of their strengths, of their structure, that they push up high the wing-back on the right side, so we adapted to that and decided to play a 4-1 in the build-up and not our usual 3-2 shape, that we have a close connection between Malang Sarr and their right wing-back. We adapted to that and played with the ball a 4-1-4-1 formation. It\u2019s impressive. It\u2019s one thing to play according to the plan and show discipline, but we were aware of how they managed to beat Man United and Tottenham, of course.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-62362c598f0832c62ade1d57\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-03-19T19:20:22.503Z\">7.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Mason Mount is </strong>as impressive with a microphone in his face as with a ball at his feet.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was never going to be comfortable.

Any competition, any game, we want to win. We just have to keep going.</p> <p>It\u2019s been a tough couple of weeks but we\u2019re just very focused and ready to play.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me. Here\u2019s the match report again, just to be sure. Bye! Louise Taylor has filed her match report from the Riverside: Uncertainty and confusion may have made an unwelcome intrusion into Chelsea\u2019s world but, for the moment at least, they show no signs of encroachment onto the pitch. As a bewildering raft of prospective buyers waited to learn if they might be handed the keys to Stamford Bridge an amalgam of occasionally ruthless control and measured efficiency propelled Thomas Tuchel\u2019s side into the FA Cup semi finals courtesy of goals from Romelu Lukaku and the excellent Hakim Ziyech. Much more here: Thomas Tuchel chats with the BBC. Of Chelsea\u2019s future he says he hopes \u201cthe process will go through as soon as possible\u201d so they can \u201csee ourselves in a calmer situation\u201d. Also: We were very focused, very serious from the beginning, showed quality in decisive moments and scored two early goals, which gave us a comfortable lead. But the effort was huge, and we never let Middlesbrough get a foot back into the door. We came from a period with a lot of matches in a short period of time, and again you\u2019re focused and get away with a deserved win, so I\u2019m very happy. I\u2019m very impressed and I\u2019m delighted [with our form]. We accepted the situation, because we did not cause it and nothing we can do can change it. So it\u2019s not in our hands but what is in our hands is to stay focused. It\u2019s a responsibility if you have such a talent and are privileged to play football for a profession. This is what we do and the culture in the club helps to support everybody, and it\u2019s very good at the moment. We saw they were brave. We were totally aware of their strengths, of their structure, that they push up high the wing-back on the right side, so we adapted to that and decided to play a 4-1 in the build-up and not our usual 3-2 shape, that we have a close connection between Malang Sarr and their right wing-back. We adapted to that and played with the ball a 4-1-4-1 formation. It\u2019s impressive. It\u2019s one thing to play according to the plan and show discipline, but we were aware of how they managed to beat Man United and Tottenham, of course. Mason Mount is as impressive with a microphone in his face as with a ball at his feet. It was never going to be comfortable. They\u2019ve been on an unbelievable run, so it was never going to be easy coming here, with the fans behind them. But I felt like we let our football do the talking and really played good stuff, and that was the main goal for us tonight. We really have that winning mentality. Any competition, any game, we want to win. We just have to keep going. It\u2019s been a tough couple of weeks but we\u2019re just very focused and ready to play. There\u2019s a lot going on around us but within the group we try to block everything out and focus as much as we can on our football. Keep training, keep working hard, and get as many wins as we can. We\u2019re all so hungry for a domestic title, and we just have to keep going. We\u2019ve already had one final this season and lost it, so we\u2019re hungry to win. Chelsea were just too good. Mount\u2019s cross for Lukaku\u2019s opener was perfect, and the second goal pretty much sealed it. But also they defended superbly. Mendy was as busy as any goalkeeper could be given that he didn\u2019t have a shot to save, and Thiago Silva\u2019s positioning was predictably impeccable throughout. 90+4 mins: It\u2019s all over! Chelsea are FA Cup semi-finalists once again! 90+3 mins: Another Chelsea free kick. Still no hurry. 90+1 mins: Chelsea play the ball around their defence. Boro try to harry them, and when Crooks eventually gets the ball he\u2019s forced to play it back to his keeper. The fourth official holds up his big board, and we\u2019ll have three more minutes. 88 mins: Chelsea win a free kick and take it with as much hurry as you\u2019d expect of a team that\u2019s a big knackered and 2-0 up. 85 mins: Coburn runs down the left, past Thiago Silva, but his cross also goes too close to Mendy. 84 mins: Harvey Vale comes on to replace Lukaku. 82 mins: Chelsea bring Kenedy on for Ziyech. Kenedy is not too far off a testimonial at Chelsea, if they still exist, and still hasn\u2019t played his 30th game for them. 81 mins: And it nearly ends with a goal! Lukaku plays the ball through to Mount, whose low ball across goal hits a defender and runs to Werner, who controls, turns, and shoots into the desperately-flung leg of Sol Bamba. 80 mins: Chelsea are playing a bit of keep-ball. 77 mins: Boro are still working hard and creating space, but for one reason or another every cross goes to Mendy. 74 mins: Boro bring Josh Coburn on for Balogun. 73 mins: Chelsea win a free-kick on the left, which Mount sends onto the head of Werner, whose header is saved. 69 mins: More good play for Boro. Jones plays not one but two one-twos, gets into the area, and sends a low cross too close to Mendy. 69 mins: Chelsea bring Timo Werner and Ngolo Kante on for Pulisic and Kovacic. 68 mins: Dijksteel steals the ball off Pulisic 10 yards outside Chelsea\u2019s penalty area, and Watmore curls a shot high and wide. They haven\u2019t had a shot on target yet. 64 mins: Boro\u2019s fans remain in fine voice despite the scoreline and their team\u2019s general prospects in this match. In the league they\u2019re two places and two points outside the play-offs, with two games in hand, and the likes of they and the side immediately below them in the table - Nottingham Forest, who play Liverpool tomorrow - still have a great chance of having more to celebrate come the end of the season. 60 mins: Bola gets to the byline but his cross loops off Azpilicueta and into Mendy\u2019s arms. Bola jogs back and Azpilicueta goes down - looks like Bola booted him in the shin in his post-cross follow-through. 58 mins: Boro make some more substitutions, taking off Neil Taylor and Aaron Connolly and bringing on Marc Bola and Duncan Watmore. 57 mins: Again Boro work the ball to Jones, who this time cuts inside, gets into the area, and then passes to Malang Sarr. 54 mins: A nice pass from Howson puts Boro on the front foot, but when they move the ball wide to Jones his cross is abysmal. Goal kick. 53 mins: McNair leaves the field minus a boot, limping, and with a strapped-up left ankle. Lee Peltier comes on. 52 mins: McNair is down, and it looks like Boro will be forced into another substitution. 51 mins: Crooks carries the ball down the right and finds Balogun, who hoofs a shot over the bar. 49 mins: Boro move the ball very nicely to the edge of Chelsea\u2019s area, but once there find all roads blocked, and Thiago Silva nicks the ball away. 46 mins: Peeeeeeep! Can Boro conjure a remarkable comeback here? There is an extremely small chance that the answer to that question is yes. Strap yourselves in! The teams are back out, and Sol Bamba is on for Boro instead of Dael Fry. 45+2 mins: Boro have had their moments, but their delivery from wide areas (almost always the right) has been poor, and Chelsea have made the most of most of their attacking opportunities. Ziyech has caught the eye in particular, even if Joe Lumley might feel he could have done better for the second goal. 45+1 mins: A good Middlesbrough move ends with Dijksteel being caught offside, shortly before he anyway delivered a terrible cross. 44 mins: Rudiger passes to Pulisic, whose right foot slips and who goes down on his left knee. It looks potentially painful and he stays down for a while, before realising it actually doesn\u2019t hurt after all and getting up again. 43 mins: Boro drop into a low block, a 3-1-4-2 formation. Chelsea play the ball around their defence under little pressure. 40 mins: Taylor brings Ziyech down and somehow gets away without a booking. 36 mins: So close to a third! A pass to a well offside Ziyech deflects to Lukaku, who rounds the keeper and rolls the ball towards goal only for Dijksteel to turn up at the last moment and clear it! 34 mins: Chelsea win a corner after pinging the ball around the edge of the area for a while without quite working a shooting chance. They are starting to enjoy themselves here. Ziyech\u2019s shot from 20 yards doesn\u2019t seem particularly powerful but it is deadly accurate, and dips wickedly past the keeper\u2019s glove and in! 30 mins: Howson has a shot from 20 yards. It is not a good one. 27 mins: Jones wins another corner. Boro are doing good things down the right flank. 23 mins: Now Loftus Cheek does give the ball away, and Tavernier chips the ball into the area for Crooks but it drops onto his thigh rather than his foot, and from there runs away. 23 mins: Loftus Cheek lingers on the ball just outside his area and three red shirts swarm around him. He gets away with it, but only just. 22 mins: It\u2019s not been a bad start for Boro, but it does already feel like this might be a long evening for them. 20 mins: Chelsea win a corner, which is headed towards goal by Thiago Silva. It was never going in, but Lukaku could have poked it home had Anfernee Dijksteel not been in the way. 18 mins: Ziyech times his pass through to Pulisic perfectly, and if he\u2019d hit it with the outside of his left foot the American would have been clean through - but he hit it with the inside of his foot and it curled to Joe Lumley. Chelsea work the ball out of defence well and from there Ziyech plays Mount down the right and his low cross to Lukaku is perfect, and left the Belgian with an easy task! 12 mins: Excellent pressure down the right, particularly from Isaiah Jones, but he can\u2019t find a forward with his cross. 9 mins: Another Chelsea move breaks down when the ball goes near Lukaku though on this occasion it\u2019s more Kovacic\u2019s fault because the ball didn\u2019t go near enough. 7 mins: The delivery from the corner is excellent, but Mendy pushes the ball away. 6 mins: Lukaku meekly surrenders the ball on halfway, and Middlesbrough convert possession into a corner. 3 mins: A bright start for the home side, but then Chelsea break forward and Mount\u2019s cross from the right squirms across goal, just out of Pulisic\u2019s reach, and to safety. 1 min: Peeeep! The home side get the ball rolling. The players emerge from the tunnel. Football imminent! Chris Wilder has a chat with the Beeb. It doesn\u2019t come any easier, does it? Seeing off Man U, quite fortunate at times I thought, saw off Tottenham, and now we pull out the European champions. We look forward to it and we\u2019ll give it a good go. We\u2019ve got to show from a physical point of view some quality, because that Premier League, it\u2019s quick, it\u2019s fast and they\u2019re all incredible athletes. So we\u2019ve got to put some miles in to get a result, but they understand that. From a motivation point of view, nothing needed. It\u2019s a state of mind for me. What an opportunity. Quarter-final of the FA Cup at home, in front of 34,000 supporters and everything to play for. Thomas Tuchel is asked whether, given everything off the field (which feels like it\u2019s mainly being asked about things off the field, rather than being significantly impacted by actual things, though I could be wrong), this has been a difficult game to prepare for. \u201cNot more difficult than the last games,\u201d he says. \u201cWe proved that we were able to produce performances and find a way to win games and we will try the same again. No change in the preparation of the game so we should be ready.\u201d There doesn\u2019t seem to have been a cloud above any part of England today. Middlesbrough in late afternoon, like Birmingham at lunchtime and my corner of north London all day, is basking in sunshine. Team news is in! Chelsea leave out Alonso, Christensen, Havertz, Jorginho and Kante and bring in Loftus-Cheek, Lukaku, Mount, Sarr and Ziyech. A clear later-in-the-alphabet bias there from Thomas Tuchel. Middlesbrough: Lumley, Anfernee Dijksteel, McNair, Fry, Jones, Crooks, Howson, Tavernier, Taylor, Balogun, Connolly. Subs: Hall, Olusanya, Peltier, Watmore, Bamba, Bola, Daniels, Coburn, Boyd-Munce. Chelsea: Mendy, Azpilicueta, Thiago Silva, Rudiger, Loftus-Cheek, Kovacic, Mount, Sarr, Ziyech, Pulisic, Lukaku. Subs: Alonso, Kante, Werner, Bettinelli, Chalobah, Barkley, Kenedy, Havertz, Vale. Referee: Paul Tierney. Chelsea have already scored one own goal before their sixth-round tie even kicks off, after bizarrely requesting that it be played behind closed doors, an intervention that was swiftly rebuffed and that will motivate the home fans to be louder than ever. \u201cI expect an FA Cup atmosphere, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need for anything more hostile and I don\u2019t think these are the words we should use in football and especially not in these times,\u201d said Thomas Tuchel yesterday, a pretty smart riposte.

We never let them get in a foot in the door but our effort was huge. We were very disciplined, very serious and showed quality in decisive moments.\u201d</p> <p>The first arrived in the 14th minute. When Ziyech\u2019s delivery picked out Mason Mount wide on the right, Mount was allowed to advance and unleash a dangerous, beautifully weighted, low cross for the on-rushing Lukaku to sweep into the back of net courtesy of a first time, six yard, shot. After winning their previous nine games at the Riverside Boro were suddenly up against it.</p> <p>Mount, who had a very good game, created Chelsea\u2019s second goal too. As yet another attempt on the part of Wilder\u2019s team to press their guests into submission broke down, a counter-attacking Mount carried the ball forward before playing in Ziyech and watching his fellow attacking midfielder\u2019s left foot do the rest.</p> <p>After cutting inside Neil Taylor, Ziyech marked his 29th birthday by extending that favoured foot and sending an audacious, angled 20-yard shot swerving and dipping beyond the thoroughly deceived Joe Lumley\u2019s outstretched fingertips.</p> <p>\u201cChampions of Europe\u201d chanted the 700 Chelsea fans gathered in the ground\u2019s south-east corner who had purchased tickets before the government imposed sanctions on their club\u2019s outgoing owner Roman Abramovich and thus prevented any further sales of seats to away supporters.</p> <p>Within minutes a crestfallen Lumley was rescued by Anfernee Dijksteel, the defender\u2019s last-ditch, impeccably timed, goal-line clearance denying Lukaku a second goal after the Belgian wrong-footed Wilder\u2019s goalkeeper.

      "bodyText": "Uncertainty and confusion have made an unwelcome intrusion into Chelsea\u2019s world but, for the moment at least, they show no signs of encroaching on to the pitch. As a bewildering raft of prospective buyers waited to learn if they might be handed the keys to Stamford Bridge an amalgam of occasionally ruthless control and measured efficiency propelled Thomas Tuchel\u2019s side into the semi-finals courtesy of goals from Romelu Lukaku and the excellent Hakim Ziyech. Middlesbrough are pushing hard for promotion from the Championship and eliminated Manchester United and Tottenham in earlier rounds but despite some decent passages of intelligent play, Chris Wilder\u2019s side rarely succeeded in unhinging a visiting defence well marshalled by Thiago Silva and Antonio R\u00fcdiger. With Tuchel\u2019s players controlling the tempo, Wilder\u2019s normally cohesive pressing game rarely hit its customary heights and an upset never really seemed feasible. \u201cIt was tough to make it look comfortable though,\u201d said Tuchel, who switched his formation to 4-1-4-1 to counter Boro\u2019s press. \u201cMiddlesbrough were brave and it was never easy. We never let them get in a foot in the door but our effort was huge. We were very disciplined, very serious and showed quality in decisive moments.\u201d The first arrived in the 14th minute. When Ziyech\u2019s delivery picked out Mason Mount wide on the right, Mount was allowed to advance and unleash a dangerous, beautifully weighted, low cross for the on-rushing Lukaku to sweep into the back of net courtesy of a first time, six yard, shot. After winning their previous nine games at the Riverside Boro were suddenly up against it. Mount, who had a very good game, created Chelsea\u2019s second goal too. As yet another attempt on the part of Wilder\u2019s team to press their guests into submission broke down, a counter-attacking Mount carried the ball forward before playing in Ziyech and watching his fellow attacking midfielder\u2019s left foot do the rest. After cutting inside Neil Taylor, Ziyech marked his 29th birthday by extending that favoured foot and sending an audacious, angled 20-yard shot swerving and dipping beyond the thoroughly deceived Joe Lumley\u2019s outstretched fingertips. \u201cChampions of Europe\u201d chanted the 700 Chelsea fans gathered in the ground\u2019s south-east corner who had purchased tickets before the government imposed sanctions on their club\u2019s outgoing owner Roman Abramovich and thus prevented any further sales of seats to away supporters. Within minutes a crestfallen Lumley was rescued by Anfernee Dijksteel, the defender\u2019s last-ditch, impeccably timed, goal-line clearance denying Lukaku a second goal after the Belgian wrong-footed Wilder\u2019s goalkeeper. Given that Dijksteel impressed in Boro\u2019s back three throughout, making some important interceptions, it seemed rather appropriate that he, albeit briefly, enjoyed a moment in the spotlight. As the sun sank behind the main stand and the sky morphed from blue to dusky pink \u00c9douard Mendy remained a peripheral figure as Wilder\u2019s players struggled to dismantle the formidable barrier constructed by Silva and co. Hard as Isaiah Jones, Boro\u2019s talented right wing-back tried, Chelsea\u2019s defence persistently second guessed even his most inventive manoeuvres. When Wilder\u2019s side finally managed a shot, Jonny Howson fluffed it. Chelsea\u2019s continued resistance to the tactics which have unnerved so many second-tier opponents must have left Boro\u2019s manager wishing the government had not relented in the face of the London club\u2019s pleas for an enhanced travel allowance. Maybe, just maybe, if they had stuck to the original budget and forced Tuchel\u2019s players to travel north by bus rather than fly to Teesside airport they might have exhibited signs of tiredness as dusk descended. Instead Ziyech in particular looked increasingly lively. Wilder\u2019s cause was further hindered by the injuries to two components of his back three which forced the replacement of Dael Fry and then Paddy McNair with the 37-year-old Sol Bamba and the 35-year-old Lee Peltier. Not that Bamba showed his years as his well-timed tackle came between Lukaku and another goal. If only Folarin Balogun, Boro\u2019s Arsenal loanee striker, had shown similar composure after Matt Crooks\u2019s smart backheel flick fooled Malang Sarr and left him with only Mendy to beat. Unable to seize the moment, Balogun sent a shot ballooning over the bar. As Lumley atoned for his arguable culpability in Ziyech\u2019s goal by palming Timo Werner\u2019s header away, Boro fans\u2019 thoughts surely began turning to their hopes of securing a play-off place. Even so their increasingly aggressive side improved as the second half wore on and Mendy needed to react with alacrity to intercept Duncan Watmore\u2019s menacing cross as team-mates jostled to lash it over the line. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t one-way traffic and I\u2019m immensely proud of the players and the club for what\u2019s been a terrific cup run,\u201d said Wilder. \u201cBut we\u2019re a little bit disappointed.

First-half foul trouble hurt the Racers, who had to figure out how to keep DJ Burns and Nicholas McMullen in the game with three fouls each.</p> <p>Shooting was a problem, too: The Racers shot 35%, including 9 of 28 in the first half. Saint Peter\u2019s finished at 42% and closed the game with a 6-0 run for their ninth consecutive victory.</p> <p>Ndefo, the Peacocks\u2019 undersized post player at 6ft 7in and 195lbs, finished with 10 rebounds and made 7 of 9 free throws.</p> <h2>No 8 North Carolina 93, No 1 Baylor 86 (OT)</h2> <p>RJ Davis racked up a career-high 30 points as North Carolina posted a 93-86 overtime win over defending national champion Baylor in an NCAA tournament East Region second-round game on Saturday at Fort Worth, Texas.</p> <p>North Carolina\u2019s Brady Manek poured in 26 points before he was ejected for a flagrant foul.</p> <p>After squandering a 25-point second-half lead and playing minus two starters down the stretch, the eighth-seeded Tar Heels never trailed in overtime against the top-seeded Bears (27-7). Davis had a three-point play in the extra session.</p> <p>North Carolina continued what has been a late-season surge. The Tar Heels will play UCLA on Friday night in the East Region semi-finals in Philadelphia.</p> <p>\u201cThis last month and a half, we\u2019ve been getting a lot better and we\u2019re gelling. We\u2019re peaking at the right time,\u201d said Armando Bacot, who collected 15 points and 16 rebounds. \u201cI\u2019m just so proud of our team.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was the craziest game I\u2019ve ever been in, but it was fun. We got thedub and we\u2019re moving on to Philly,\u201d North Carolina\u2019s Leaky Black said.</p> <p>Adam Flagler pumped in 27 points, James Akinjo had 20 and Jeremy Sochan added 15 points for Baylor, which rallied in the last 10 1/2 minutes of regulation.</p> <p>Akinjo\u2019s three-point play with 15.8 seconds tied the game at 80-80. Davis missed a potential winning three-pointer to end regulation.</p> <p>A 12-0 run for the Tar Heels appeared to put the game out of reach in the second half, with the margin stretched to 67-42.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9cda4aaa57bd6525d55454394536f15ba651da3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9cda4aaa57bd6525d55454394536f15ba651da3/0_0_3030_1935/1000.jpg\" alt=\"North Carolina Tar Heels\" width=\"1000\" height=\"639\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">North Carolina Tar Heels forward Brady Manek (45) celebrates a basket against the Baylor Bears during their NCAA tournament second-round game on Saturday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Jairaj/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Baylor mounted a response to close within 67-53 with more than eight minutes remaining. It was 71-62 by the 5:22 mark. Akinjo\u2019s three-point play with 1:48 left made it 76-73. Bacot\u2019s three-point play temporarily steadied the Tar Heels.</p> <p>The Bears, who already were hampered by late-season injuries, fell into foul trouble by early in the second half. However, North Carolina guard Caleb Love fouled out with more than six minutes left shortly after Manek exited at 10:08.</p> <p>The Tar Heels had to overcome a home-state crowd supporting Baylor, but they pulled off a second upset this month in a hostile environment after winning the regular-season final at Duke.</p> <h2>No 11 Michigan 76, No 3 Tennessee 68</h2> <p>Eli Brooks put Michigan ahead for good with a three-point play and delivered four critical points in the final minute, and the 11th-seeded Wolverines booked the most surprising of their five straight trips to the Sweet 16 by beating No 3 seed Tennessee 76-68 in the second round of the NCAA tournament on Saturday.</p> <p>Brooks finished with 23 points, including a looping, improvised hook shot and two free throws as Michigan (19-14) put away the Volunteers, who had a six-point lead with eight and a half minutes left but then went four minutes without scoring. Their cold shooting continued until it was too late.</p> <p>Big man Hunter Dickinson had 27 points and two of his 10 rebounds in the closing seconds for the Wolverines, whose five straight Sweet 16 appearances are the most in Division I. Gonzaga are the only other team to make it four straight times.</p> <p>Michigan will face either second-seeded Villanova or longtime rival Ohio State, the No 7 seed, in Thursday\u2019s South Region semi-finals in San Antonio, Texas.</p> <p>But coach Juwan Howard\u2019s squad still has plenty of talent and elevated its play down the stretch against the Southeastern Conference champions. Howard himself had to learn some lessons about composure when he was suspended for five games late in the season for hitting a Wisconsin assistant during a postgame handshake line.</p> <p>Kennedy Chandler had 19 points and Josiah-Jordan James had 13 for Tennessee (27-8), which had a seven-game winning streak snapped. Two days after shooting a school tourney record 60% from the field, the Vols shot 41.8% and came up short again in the postseason. Tennessee lost to Oregon State in the first round last year, also at Gainbridge Fieldhouse.</p> <h2>No 1 Kansas 72, No 9 Creighton 72</h2> <p>Remy Martin scored 20 points, Ochai Agbaji put Kansas ahead for good with his first basket early in the second half, and the Jayhawks held off Creighton 79-72 on Saturday to advance to the Sweet 16.</p> <p>Martin hadn\u2019t led top-seeded Kansas (30-6) in scoring all season as the fifth-year senior transfer from Arizona State battled a sore knee, but he\u2019s done it in both NCAA tournament games.</p> <p>The shorthanded Bluejays (23-12) stayed close with an uncharacteristically hot showing from three-point range. One of the worst teams in the country from beyond the arc, ninth-seeded Creighton went 12 of 28.</p> <p>The biggest came from freshman Trey Alexander, who swished an off-balance heave from well behind the line as the shot clock was about to expire. Keyshawn Feazell\u2019s bucket soon after got Creighton within one in the final two minutes.</p> <p>The Bluejays had a chance to go ahead in the final minute, but Alexander\u2019s errant pass went off Alex O\u2019Connell\u2019s hands, leading to a breakaway dunk for Agbaji, who scored 13 of his 15 points in the second half.</p> <p>Ryan Hawkins drained a three-pointer from well behind the arc 13 seconds into the game and finished 3 of 6 from distance with 14 points. O\u2019Connell was 3 of 8 and scored 16. Alexander finished with 14.</p> <h2>No 4 UCLA 72, No 5 Saint Mary\u2019s 56</h2> <p>Tyger Campbell scored 16 points and fourth-seeded UCLA completed a more conventional path to the Sweet 16, beating fifth-seeded Saint Mary\u0019s.</p> <p>UCLA (27-7), which went all the way from the First Four to the Final Four last year, instead knocked off two worse-seeded foes in Akron and then the Gaels (26-8).</p> <p>The Bruins lost star Jaime Jaquez Jr to a right ankle injury with 6:58 in the game. He winced as he was helped off the court by teammates and later returned to the bench with his ankle wrapped in ice. Jaquez finished with 15 points, all in the first half.</p> <p>Logan Johnson scored 18 points for Saint Mary\u0019s.</p> <h2>No 4 Providence 79, No 12 Richmond 51</h2> <p>Noah Horchler scored 16 points and Providence had its best three-point shooting performance of the season, routing Richmond to reach its first Sweet 16 in 25 years.</p> <p>The fourth-seeded Friars (27-5) looked like a juggernaut against the Spiders, posting the most lopsided NCAA tournament victory in program history.</p> <p>Providence controlled the game from the start and went up 21 on Richmond (24-13) less than two minutes into the second half when Horchler swished a three from the corner. The Friars shot 52% from the field, and a season-best 54.5% from 3. They came in shooting 34.3% from long range.</p> <p>Nathan Cayo led the Spiders with 18 points on 9-of-11 shooting.</p> <h2>No 4 Arkansas 53, No 12 New Mexico State 48</h2> <p>Au\u0019Diese Toney\u0019s fastbreak dunk capped the decisive run with about six minutes left and fourth-seeded Arkansas beat No.12 seed New Mexico State to reach the Sweet 16 for the second consecutive year.</p> <p>JD Notae scored 18 points before fouling out with 1:22 left and Jaylin Williams had 10 points and 15 rebounds for the Razorbacks (27-8). Notae\u2019s replacement, Chris Lykes, hit all four free-throw attempts in the final 10 seconds to secure the win after the Aggies closed within two points on Teddy Allen\u2019s three-pointer with 12 seconds left.</p> <p>The Razorbacks will play top-seeded Gonzaga in San Francisco on Thursday.</p> <p>Allen was limited to 12 points after scoring 37 in the first round against Connecticut. Johnny McCants scored 16 points and added 12 rebounds for New Mexico State (27-7). The Western Athletic Conference champion was denied a chance to reach the Sweet 16 for the second time in school history and first since 1992.</p> <h2>No 1 Gonzaga 82, No 9 Memphis 78</h2> <p>Drew Timme scored 21 of his 25 points in the second half, and top overall seed Gonzaga rallied from a 10-point halftime deficit to beat Memphis.</p> <p>Trailing at the half for only the fourth time this season, Gonzaga leaned on their star junior to reach its seventh straight Sweet 16. The Bulldogs (28-3) will face No 4 seed Arkansas in the West Region semifinals on Thursday in San Francisco.</p> <p>Andrew Nembhard added 23 points for the Bulldogs, Rasir Bolton scored 17 and Gonzaga never trailed after a basket from Timme and Bolton\u0019s three-pointer with 10 minutes remaining that made it 61-57.</p> <p>DeAndre Williams scored 14 points for Memphis (22-11). NBA prospects Chet Holmgren of Gonzaga and Jalen Duren of Memphis were limited by foul trouble.</p>",

Two days after tossing eight-time national champion Kentucky out of the bracket, the tiny Jesuit school from Jersey City, New Jersey, became the third 15 seed to advance to a regional semifinal, joining Oral Roberts last year and Florida Gulf Coast in 2013. Saint Peter\u2019s (21-11) ended a 21-game winning streak and a memorable season for Murray State (31-3), located 265 miles from Lexington in Kentucky\u2019s southeastern corner. The memories will be lifelong for the Peacocks and coach Shaheen Holloway, a North Jersey hoops lifer who played at Seton Hall and apprenticed there as an assistant. On Friday, Pirates coach Kevin Willard endorsed Holloway as his replacement if he departs in the offseason. Holloway has more immediate concerns: preparing his team for an East Region semifinal on Friday in Philadelphia against Texas or Purdue. Doug Edert came off the bench to score 13 points for the Peacocks, including some big baskets late. Saint Peter\u2019s built a 13-point lead early in the second half and never trailed, but Murray State still made it tense.

Shooting was a problem, too: The Racers shot 35%, including 9 of 28 in the first half. Saint Peter\u2019s finished at 42% and closed the game with a 6-0 run for their ninth consecutive victory. Ndefo, the Peacocks\u2019 undersized post player at 6ft 7in and 195lbs, finished with 10 rebounds and made 7 of 9 free throws. No 8 North Carolina 93, No 1 Baylor 86 (OT) RJ Davis racked up a career-high 30 points as North Carolina posted a 93-86 overtime win over defending national champion Baylor in an NCAA tournament East Region second-round game on Saturday at Fort Worth, Texas. North Carolina\u2019s Brady Manek poured in 26 points before he was ejected for a flagrant foul. After squandering a 25-point second-half lead and playing minus two starters down the stretch, the eighth-seeded Tar Heels never trailed in overtime against the top-seeded Bears (27-7). Davis had a three-point play in the extra session. North Carolina continued what has been a late-season surge. The Tar Heels will play UCLA on Friday night in the East Region semi-finals in Philadelphia. \u201cThis last month and a half, we\u2019ve been getting a lot better and we\u2019re gelling. We\u2019re peaking at the right time,\u201d said Armando Bacot, who collected 15 points and 16 rebounds. \u201cI\u2019m just so proud of our team.\u201d \u201cThat was the craziest game I\u2019ve ever been in, but it was fun. We got thedub and we\u2019re moving on to Philly,\u201d North Carolina\u2019s Leaky Black said. Adam Flagler pumped in 27 points, James Akinjo had 20 and Jeremy Sochan added 15 points for Baylor, which rallied in the last 10 1/2 minutes of regulation. Akinjo\u2019s three-point play with 15.8 seconds tied the game at 80-80. Davis missed a potential winning three-pointer to end regulation. A 12-0 run for the Tar Heels appeared to put the game out of reach in the second half, with the margin stretched to 67-42. But Baylor mounted a response to close within 67-53 with more than eight minutes remaining. It was 71-62 by the 5:22 mark. Akinjo\u2019s three-point play with 1:48 left made it 76-73. Bacot\u2019s three-point play temporarily steadied the Tar Heels. The Bears, who already were hampered by late-season injuries, fell into foul trouble by early in the second half. However, North Carolina guard Caleb Love fouled out with more than six minutes left shortly after Manek exited at 10:08. The Tar Heels had to overcome a home-state crowd supporting Baylor, but they pulled off a second upset this month in a hostile environment after winning the regular-season final at Duke. No 11 Michigan 76, No 3 Tennessee 68 Eli Brooks put Michigan ahead for good with a three-point play and delivered four critical points in the final minute, and the 11th-seeded Wolverines booked the most surprising of their five straight trips to the Sweet 16 by beating No 3 seed Tennessee 76-68 in the second round of the NCAA tournament on Saturday. Brooks finished with 23 points, including a looping, improvised hook shot and two free throws as Michigan (19-14) put away the Volunteers, who had a six-point lead with eight and a half minutes left but then went four minutes without scoring. Their cold shooting continued until it was too late. Big man Hunter Dickinson had 27 points and two of his 10 rebounds in the closing seconds for the Wolverines, whose five straight Sweet 16 appearances are the most in Division I. Gonzaga are the only other team to make it four straight times. Michigan will face either second-seeded Villanova or longtime rival Ohio State, the No 7 seed, in Thursday\u2019s South Region semi-finals in San Antonio, Texas. But coach Juwan Howard\u2019s squad still has plenty of talent and elevated its play down the stretch against the Southeastern Conference champions. Howard himself had to learn some lessons about composure when he was suspended for five games late in the season for hitting a Wisconsin assistant during a postgame handshake line. Kennedy Chandler had 19 points and Josiah-Jordan James had 13 for Tennessee (27-8), which had a seven-game winning streak snapped. Two days after shooting a school tourney record 60% from the field, the Vols shot 41.8% and came up short again in the postseason. Tennessee lost to Oregon State in the first round last year, also at Gainbridge Fieldhouse. No 1 Kansas 72, No 9 Creighton 72 Remy Martin scored 20 points, Ochai Agbaji put Kansas ahead for good with his first basket early in the second half, and the Jayhawks held off Creighton 79-72 on Saturday to advance to the Sweet 16. Martin hadn\u2019t led top-seeded Kansas (30-6) in scoring all season as the fifth-year senior transfer from Arizona State battled a sore knee, but he\u2019s done it in both NCAA tournament games. The shorthanded Bluejays (23-12) stayed close with an uncharacteristically hot showing from three-point range. One of the worst teams in the country from beyond the arc, ninth-seeded Creighton went 12 of 28. The biggest came from freshman Trey Alexander, who swished an off-balance heave from well behind the line as the shot clock was about to expire. Keyshawn Feazell\u2019s bucket soon after got Creighton within one in the final two minutes. The Bluejays had a chance to go ahead in the final minute, but Alexander\u2019s errant pass went off Alex O\u2019Connell\u2019s hands, leading to a breakaway dunk for Agbaji, who scored 13 of his 15 points in the second half. Ryan Hawkins drained a three-pointer from well behind the arc 13 seconds into the game and finished 3 of 6 from distance with 14 points. O\u2019Connell was 3 of 8 and scored 16. Alexander finished with 14. No 4 UCLA 72, No 5 Saint Mary\u2019s 56 Tyger Campbell scored 16 points and fourth-seeded UCLA completed a more conventional path to the Sweet 16, beating fifth-seeded Saint Mary\u0019s. UCLA (27-7), which went all the way from the First Four to the Final Four last year, instead knocked off two worse-seeded foes in Akron and then the Gaels (26-8). The Bruins lost star Jaime Jaquez Jr to a right ankle injury with 6:58 in the game. He winced as he was helped off the court by teammates and later returned to the bench with his ankle wrapped in ice. Jaquez finished with 15 points, all in the first half. Logan Johnson scored 18 points for Saint Mary\u0019s. No 4 Providence 79, No 12 Richmond 51 Noah Horchler scored 16 points and Providence had its best three-point shooting performance of the season, routing Richmond to reach its first Sweet 16 in 25 years. The fourth-seeded Friars (27-5) looked like a juggernaut against the Spiders, posting the most lopsided NCAA tournament victory in program history. Providence controlled the game from the start and went up 21 on Richmond (24-13) less than two minutes into the second half when Horchler swished a three from the corner. The Friars shot 52% from the field, and a season-best 54.5% from 3. They came in shooting 34.3% from long range. Nathan Cayo led the Spiders with 18 points on 9-of-11 shooting. No 4 Arkansas 53, No 12 New Mexico State 48 Au\u0019Diese Toney\u0019s fastbreak dunk capped the decisive run with about six minutes left and fourth-seeded Arkansas beat No.12 seed New Mexico State to reach the Sweet 16 for the second consecutive year. JD Notae scored 18 points before fouling out with 1:22 left and Jaylin Williams had 10 points and 15 rebounds for the Razorbacks (27-8). Notae\u2019s replacement, Chris Lykes, hit all four free-throw attempts in the final 10 seconds to secure the win after the Aggies closed within two points on Teddy Allen\u2019s three-pointer with 12 seconds left. The Razorbacks will play top-seeded Gonzaga in San Francisco on Thursday. Allen was limited to 12 points after scoring 37 in the first round against Connecticut. Johnny McCants scored 16 points and added 12 rebounds for New Mexico State (27-7). The Western Athletic Conference champion was denied a chance to reach the Sweet 16 for the second time in school history and first since 1992. No 1 Gonzaga 82, No 9 Memphis 78 Drew Timme scored 21 of his 25 points in the second half, and top overall seed Gonzaga rallied from a 10-point halftime deficit to beat Memphis. Trailing at the half for only the fourth time this season, Gonzaga leaned on their star junior to reach its seventh straight Sweet 16. The Bulldogs (28-3) will face No 4 seed Arkansas in the West Region semifinals on Thursday in San Francisco. Andrew Nembhard added 23 points for the Bulldogs, Rasir Bolton scored 17 and Gonzaga never trailed after a basket from Timme and Bolton\u0019s three-pointer with 10 minutes remaining that made it 61-57. DeAndre Williams scored 14 points for Memphis (22-11). NBA prospects Chet Holmgren of Gonzaga and Jalen Duren of Memphis were limited by foul trouble.",

The Levada Centre, which is Russia\u2019s main independent pollster, has not released a poll of public opinion on the war since the conflict began.

A lot of key information is being withheld,\u201d said Belanovsky.</p> <p>Others have said that Russians are simply afraid to tell pollsters they are opposed to the war.</p> <p>\u201cConducting surveys in authoritarian countries is tricky. Respondents in Russia believe surveys are conducted by the government. Especially during wartime, respondents, they will be less likely to feel open to talk,\u201d said Grigory Yudin, a sociologist.</p> <p>Yudin said that, according to his research, fewer Russians were willing to speak with pollsters since the beginning of the war, with only 25% of those approached now willing to answer questions on Ukraine, compared with 33% when the invasion started.</p> <p>Yudin added: \u201cBased on my own ideas, I believe a much smaller group is actively in favour of war, actively militarised. That group does exist and it is a worrisome group but it is not the majority.\u201d</p> <p>Aggressive efforts to generate support for the invasion have left opponents of the war aghast. When Putin appeared on Friday, a banner calling \u201cFor a world without Nazism\u201d bore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/why-has-the-letter-z-become-the-symbol-of-war-for-russia\" title=\"\">the letter Z</a>, a tactical marking used on Russian tanks in Ukraine.

      "bodyText": "\u201cFlying by the seat of my pants.\u201d This is how Sydney pop artist Thomas Porter describes the lead-up to his first ever live show. The 24-year-old musician signed with independent label Dew Process just as the pandemic hit, released an EP on Friday and has no idea if he\u2019s going to be able to turn his bedroom music into a live show \u2013 or if anyone will come to hear it. \u201cI\u2019m terrified,\u201d Porter says. \u201cThere\u2019s been two years of hype at this point. I\u2019ve never performed any of these songs.\u201d Porter is one of the musicians dubbed \u201cCovid babies\u201d by the industry. They were signed or got big during the pandemic, but are lacking that live performance experience most up-and-coming acts have. Some artists \u2013 like pop musician Flynn Sant, who goes by Flowerkid \u2013 even have millions of plays on Spotify and YouTube and tens of thousands of engaged fans on social media. The Warner Music signed 20-year-old is on the bill for Splendour in the Grass and this week performed his first ever live show at The Great Club in Marrickville. He says it\u2019s weird \u201cbeing online and being recognised as a musician\u201d, but not having the live music chops to back it up. Flynn was so nervous before going on stage that he threw up. But the butterflies didn\u2019t last. \u201cAs soon as I got out there and started, I was like \u2018yep, this is where I\u2019m meant to be\u2019 and I just kept going no matter how many little things I stuffed up,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t care as much for this silly little details, but rather the vibe and it felt great and everybody was cheering. It was incredible.\u201d Canberra rapper Seaton Rogers, who performs under the name YNG Martyr, also got his first big live moment earlier this month. \u201cIt was a 50-50 mix of \u2018this is happening\u2019 and then \u2018oh shit, this is happening\u2019,\u201d he says, still buzzing from the set days later. After years of making music and practising it at home, the 22-year-old Wiradjuri man is finally getting his chance to see if his success online was going to translate in real life. Rogers had moderate success until right before the first lockdown of 2020 when his song Nike Ticks \u201cliterally blew up\u201d. He watched the number of listens tick up from his bedroom and wanted to get out there and perform. \u201cThere were points where I tried to launch tours, I was so, so set on it, tickets had been sold. And then it was, \u2018nup, borders are closed, everything\u2019s off\u2019,\u201d he says. He tried to make the most of it, knowing the ears and eyes on him online presented an \u201cinsane opportunity\u201d. \u201cI had to figure out ways to capitalise on it in my bedroom,\u201d he says. And he did \u2013 with about 1.5m listens on Spotify each month and tens of thousands of followers, he worked on his image and marketing, and kept his fingers crossed that when he was able to go on stage, there were people on the other side listening. \u201cIt was so hard for me to see that what I\u2019ve done online could translate into real life because I physically never got to see it, never got to play a show or meet up with fans,\u201d he says. \u201cI was sitting there like I have online buzz but where is it?

Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cIt\u2019s a lot different when you\u2019re out there and jumping around and there\u2019s a massive stage.

He had a show planned for right before Christmas, but it was cancelled \u2013 like so many others \u2013 as Omicron kicked off. He hopes to book another show to celebrate the release of Manic Pixie Dream Girl. But with two years of postponed shows across the city, finding a spare stage is proving tricky. Dew Process A&amp;R manager Harry Young says it is becoming an issue for lots of the artists in the same boat. \u201cTours have been postponed so much and there\u2019s lots of smaller acts that are crying for those same venues,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of venues are talking about how they are already booked the whole year.\u201d Young has always used social media as a way to find new talent but without then being able to go watch people live as well, it has been harder to work out who has what it takes to make it as a performing musician. \u201cYou can have millions of streams on a song but some things don\u2019t transfer as well to a live show,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t see if people can connect to your songs the same way when it\u2019s not live.\u201d And for most artists in Australia, performing live is incredibly important to make it a viable career. \u201cWe make music for the passion of it, but I\u2019m in my 20s, I do need a bit of money if I want to pay my rent,\u201d Porter says. \u201cNot having that is really, really scary.

      "body": "<p>In August 1926, on the banks of the east Kimberley\u2019s Forrest River, an Aboriginal deacon found a pile of charred bone fragments.</p> <p>The Rev James Noble, famed for his tracking skills, had been sent to investigate whether Aboriginal residents of the Forrest River mission had been shot by the Western Australian police.</p> <p>A young woman called Loorabane had turned up at the mission with a bullet wound in her leg and a terrifying story of escaping a police shooting that had killed her mother and dozens of others. She and her brother, Kangaloo, were seeking refuge.</p> <p>Noble followed a series of horse tracks and footprints to a quiet, picturesque place called Gotegotemerrie, where he found a mound of ashy sand on the riverbank. Just 10 metres away was a deep hole covered by stones, where a large fire had been left to burn.

A subsequent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/mar/06/conspiracy-of-silence-how-sabotaged-inquiries-fed-massacre-denials\">royal commission confirmed that at least 11 Aboriginal people had been killed</a> and their remains burned in three purpose-built stone ovens.</p> <p>Noble\u2019s great-granddaughter Tabatha Saunders says she is proud to know he ensured their crimes were revealed to history.</p> <p>\u201cThey thought they could hide the massacres, but my great-grandfather found the evidence,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t even comprehend how he tried to understand or cope with this atrocity. What horrors must have been going through his mind as he walked along the sand that day?\u201d</p> <p>Saunders, a Badtjala and Bidjara woman based in Brisbane, learned of her great-grandfather\u2019s harrowing discovery during an online search for her family history. </p> <p>\u201cI became aware of his involvement by accident. I was researching his life story because he had died in the early 1940s.\u201d</p> <p>Saunders was keenly aware of the atrocities committed against Aboriginal peoples during this period and had some prior knowledge of her great-grandfather\u2019s presence at the Forrest River mission, but she had no idea what he had witnessed.</p> <p>\u201cI had read on certain websites, mostly theological, about a certain massacre at Forrest River and his involvement. I looked into it further and was surprised and horrified to discover that he was the tracker who discovered the [victims\u2019] remains,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Saunders had always been told that her ancestors were survivors and this was clear, yet shocking proof.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5a1aff0d98cfcc61db0230dafdc93555664b998e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a1aff0d98cfcc61db0230dafdc93555664b998e/0_458_7952_4774/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tabatha Saunders, the great-granddaughter of the Reverend James Noble, who uncovered the Forrest River massacre in the Kimberley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tabatha Saunders, the great-granddaughter of the Reverend James Noble.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rhett Hammerton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cImagine yourself walking into a place.

Born in Boulia, north Queensland, he worked as a stockman from a young age.</p> <p>\u201cHe was well regarded as a good worker, and as a teenager he asked to be educated. The people who owned the cattle station sent him to school,\u201d Saunders says.</p> <p>Saunders believes Noble joined the church so he could provide meaningful assistance to Aboriginal communities.</p> <p>\u201cMy great-grandfather was obviously a very intelligent man and very gifted.

      "bodyText": "In August 1926, on the banks of the east Kimberley\u2019s Forrest River, an Aboriginal deacon found a pile of charred bone fragments. The Rev James Noble, famed for his tracking skills, had been sent to investigate whether Aboriginal residents of the Forrest River mission had been shot by the Western Australian police. A young woman called Loorabane had turned up at the mission with a bullet wound in her leg and a terrifying story of escaping a police shooting that had killed her mother and dozens of others. She and her brother, Kangaloo, were seeking refuge. Noble followed a series of horse tracks and footprints to a quiet, picturesque place called Gotegotemerrie, where he found a mound of ashy sand on the riverbank. Just 10 metres away was a deep hole covered by stones, where a large fire had been left to burn. He would later tell a royal commission it appeared to be a makeshift oven. Noble had discovered just a fraction of the atrocities carried out by police constables Graham St Jack and Denis Regan, who led a posse of 13 police and civilians \u2013 with an arsenal of Winchester rifles, 500 to 600 rounds of ammunition, 42 horses and shotguns \u2013 to avenge the killing of a pastoralist, Frederick Hay, who had been killed by an Aboriginal man named Lumbia for the rape of his wife, Anguloo. Noble\u2019s efforts led to a police inquiry, which concluded that 16 people had been killed and their remains burned. A subsequent royal commission confirmed that at least 11 Aboriginal people had been killed and their remains burned in three purpose-built stone ovens. Noble\u2019s great-granddaughter Tabatha Saunders says she is proud to know he ensured their crimes were revealed to history. \u201cThey thought they could hide the massacres, but my great-grandfather found the evidence,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t even comprehend how he tried to understand or cope with this atrocity. What horrors must have been going through his mind as he walked along the sand that day?\u201d Saunders, a Badtjala and Bidjara woman based in Brisbane, learned of her great-grandfather\u2019s harrowing discovery during an online search for her family history. \u201cI became aware of his involvement by accident. I was researching his life story because he had died in the early 1940s.\u201d Saunders was keenly aware of the atrocities committed against Aboriginal peoples during this period and had some prior knowledge of her great-grandfather\u2019s presence at the Forrest River mission, but she had no idea what he had witnessed. \u201cI had read on certain websites, mostly theological, about a certain massacre at Forrest River and his involvement. I looked into it further and was surprised and horrified to discover that he was the tracker who discovered the [victims\u2019] remains,\u201d she said. Saunders had always been told that her ancestors were survivors and this was clear, yet shocking proof. \u201cImagine yourself walking into a place. You soon realise that there are bodily remains. You notice there are tiny bones. You realise they are the bones of infants. Then you realise there are the bones of adults. You see that those bones are all together and you realise they are the bones of mothers and babies. There are 30 to 40 remains. This is what my great-grandfather would have endured. \u201cThe trauma \u2013 intergenerational trauma \u2013 is real,\u201d she says. \u201cWe hear these stories about our mothers, grandmothers, great-grandmothers. This is still in living memory for us. It hurts.\u201d Working under the radar Noble was known as a kind and proud man, and an excellent tracker and horseman. Born in Boulia, north Queensland, he worked as a stockman from a young age. \u201cHe was well regarded as a good worker, and as a teenager he asked to be educated. The people who owned the cattle station sent him to school,\u201d Saunders says. Saunders believes Noble joined the church so he could provide meaningful assistance to Aboriginal communities. \u201cMy great-grandfather was obviously a very intelligent man and very gifted. I think he saw the way of the whites as a portal for him to be able [to try to] win what really was a losing battle for our people under the colonial regime. \u201cThe colonials were hell-bent on indoctrinating the \u2018savages\u2019,\u201d Saunders says. \u201cIf he could glide under the radar and \u2018assimilate\u2019 in a way, he would be able to help communities in his own way.\u201d The historian Christine Halse has described Noble as \u201cadmired and appreciated by the local tribes\u201d, writing that he helped to prevent multiple incidents of violence between settlers and First Nations people. But he could not stop the atrocities at Forrest River. Eliminating the evidence Lily Johnson, who was a girl on the Forrest River mission at the time of the massacre, gave an interview in 1986 in which she recalled seeing Loorabane arrive with a gunshot wound. \u201cI was playing with the other girls when Loorabane came,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cShe was shaking with fright. She told us what happened and we told Mamma [Angelina, Noble\u2019s wife] and Mamma told Jim [Noble]. \u201cThe police \u2026 put the men on one chain and the women with their children and their kids on another chain. Some of those women had babes at the breast \u2026 they killed the men. They just lined them up and shot them one by one. The women had to watch those men being shot, their husbands and brothers and relatives. \u201cThe women were taken to another place just a bit away and had to stand on the riverbank [which] was dry that time of year \u2026 and they were shot there, so their bodies just fell into the river [bed]. They bashed the brains out of the babies and threw them into the river with their mothers and burnt the lot.\u201d Loorabane and Kangaloo escaped, but police shot and killed their mother. According to Johnson, the children \u201chid in the roots of the pandanus grass in the Forrest River \u2026 The police looked for them everywhere but they just kept real still, not moving because they were so scared. By evening, when they thought it was safe to leave, they moved out, swam across the Forrest River and travelled all the next day and then the day after until the evening until they reached the mission where they knew they\u2019d be safe.\u201d Noble, the mission\u2019s superintendent, the Rev Ernest Gribble, and the WA Aborigines Department inspector, EC Mitchell, followed the tracks of the perpetrators and their captives to other sites at Rounggu, Mowerie, Umbali and Dala, where they encountered more evidence of incineration. Police inspector William Douglas conducted a follow-up investigation, noting that at one of the sites, he \u201cfound the remains of a large fire and some thousands of fragments of bone in the ashes\u201d. At other sites, the perpetrators had emptied the ovens and thrown the charred remains into nearby billabongs. Numerous accounts of the atrocities were translated by Noble\u2019s wife, Angelina, who spoke at least five Indigenous languages. She played a critical role as an interpreter of early reports of the shootings and as the official translator at the royal commission. \u201cMy great-grandfather might have found all of the evidence, but without her they would never have been able to understand. She is probably even more important in the outcome than him,\u201d Saunders says. Dr Chris Owen, author of Every Mother\u2019s Son is Guilty: Policing the Kimberley Frontier of Western Australia, says makeshift ovens were a common tool for destroying massacre evidence. \u201cIt was a method used from the 1890s through to the 1920s,\u201d Owen says. \u201cPolice did investigate a lot of alleged killing of Aboriginal people, and incineration became the way in which all evidence of a murder was obliterated.

      "bodyText": "Residents in Lismore have been left with no choice but to move back into their houses that have been deemed uninhabitable, with some sleeping on swags in mouldy rooms without electricity, as they are unable to find safe accommodation three weeks after floods devastated the town. In South Lismore \u2013 a low-lying part of the town that bore the brunt of historic flooding this year and an area well known for attracting residents seeking affordable housing \u2013 Guardian Australia spoke with multiple residents who had evacuated town following the floods but had returned to their homes in recent days. The State Emergency Service had deemed more than 3,600 homes across the New South Wales northern rivers region as uninhabitable and on Friday some residents were living in homes that had been as assessed as such. In one case, a homeowner had returned to their property which had been condemned for demolition after being assessed as structurally unsound, and had warning tape erected at its entrance, however they did not want to be interviewed. Some homes in South Lismore were swept off their foundations, but they remained intact, despite needing renovations and structural repairs. Stories of residents living in unsafe housing follow revelations in Guardian Australia that motor homes intended for Lismore residents whose houses were inundated in the floods were lying empty because linen and water sources had not been organised, while housing \u201cpods\u201d promised by the NSW government were yet to materialise. On Crown Street, the Lee family\u2019s home was deemed uninhabitable after flooding rose to about chest height on its elevated top floor. The family of four hosted four neighbours on the Sunday that waters rose, and all eight had to be rescued by a friend who had a boat on Monday 28 February. After evacuating, brothers Ryan and Evan have slept at a variety of places, including at their grandparents\u2019 home and on friends\u2019 couches. Their parents also leaned on family and friends for accommodation. While they were able to rely on people who opened their homes to them, countless other residents also required temporary accommodation. And so on Monday, after weeks of living in cramped conditions with other flood evacuees, the Lee family made the difficult decision to return to their home, despite its status as uninhabitable. \u201cThere was nowhere else left to go, that is the only reason why we\u2019re back here,\u201d said Evan, a 20-year-old student, who was sleeping on an old fold-out camping bed made of steel, less than a metre from his mother, who was sleeping on a blow-up mattress. Ryan, a 21-year-old labourer, was sleeping on a swag in the next room, while their father, Andy, was sleeping at his brother\u2019s house due to a back problem. While water was running, the Lees were unsure if it was safe, so were drinking bottled water. The house relied on a portable generator for electricity, and its mountain of flood-ruined possessions in the front yard was yet to be collected. \u201cI\u2019ve got no idea when it will be collected, but hopefully it\u2019s within the next week because it\u2019s starting to smell pretty bad,\u201d Ryan said. Outside, the smell of dried dirt and sewage lingered. Inside, water damage and mould was evident. It was hot inside the rooms, and flood damage left it largely unprotected from the elements. The family had been told it would take more than six months for their home to be rebuilt and safe for them to move back in. Despite this, Andy said one benefit of the fact they had returned to the home was that they could protect against looters looking to steal donated goods, such as fridges and washing machines, that had already arrived at some homes.

Wait after rain The New South Wales government\u2019s Beachwatch program advises people avoid swimming at ocean beaches for one day after heavy rainfall, or for as long as storm water is present. For more sheltered harbour areas and bays, the suggested wait time stretches to three days. The most obvious signs of storm water and flood water pollution to look for are discolouration of the water, and debris both floating in the water and washing up on the tide line. A spokesperson for Beachwatch said flood waters were still flowing into the ocean from the Hawkesbury River, Sydney Harbour and Botany Bay, \u201cturning the ocean brown from the Central Coast to Wollongong and up to 8km out to sea\u201d. Forecasts issued on Friday advised of possible pollution at Sydney\u2019s ocean and harbour beaches. Daily forecasts are available on the Beachwatch website. Prof Stuart Khan, a water quality expert and the director of the graduate school of engineering at the University of NSW, said the Beachwatch guidance was based on \u201cmore than a decade of water quality monitoring and understanding of how the beaches are impacted by rainfall\u201d. Swimming in polluted water is a health risk due to the pathogens from raw sewage, Khan said. \u201cWhen it rains in big cities like Sydney, water gets into our sewers, because the sewers are not sealed.\u201d The sewers are designed to overflow in cases of extreme rain, running into storm water pipes that discharge directly into open waterways, instead of being directed to sewage treatment plants. \u201cTherefore you have all of the pathogenic microorganisms that you would associate with raw sewage: bacteria, viruses as well, and protozoan organisms like cryptosporidium and giardia,\u201d Khan said. Exposure to these microorganisms can result in gastroenteritis, and ear and skin infections. \u201cThe threat with those sorts of organisms is short term because most of them don\u2019t survive well in the environment,\u201d Khan said. Given how extreme the recent rainfall has been, he suggests exercising caution and waiting for even longer than the guidelines recommend. \u201cFor something like this where the whole system is flushed, I think you\u2019d want to be pretty careful and leave a bit of extra time,\u201d agreed Phillip Birtles, the integrated water cycle manager for Sydney Water. Other swimming hazards \u201cEven as microbial levels return to normal there still may be a large amount of debris or other hazards, such as murky water, which should be considered,\u201d said a Beachwatch spokesperson. Experts have previously warned beachgoers to avoid swimming in murky water due the risk of shark encounters following weeks of heavy rain. Earlier this month, the NSW Department of Primary Industries said turbid water \u201ccan make conditions ideal for ambush predators, like sharks, to hunt in\u201d. \u201cRun-off and nutrients from the land run into our waterways and can attract fish and other animals to feed \u2013 this can then attract sharks,\u201d a DPI spokesperson said. How does heavy rain affect marine life? Storm water can be surprisingly detrimental to both freshwater and saltwater environments, Khan said. During heavy rainfall, organic carbon matter \u2013 such as leaves and sticks \u2013 is transported through storm water systems into waterways. Once there, bacteria biodegrade these materials, consuming oxygen in the process. \u201cWhen there are low oxygen concentrations in water, that\u2019s when \u2026 fish suffocate,\u201d Khan said. \u201cThere have been a number of reports of significant fish kills around NSW following the floods we had a couple of weeks ago.\u201d An increase in dissolved carbon compounds can also darken the water, leading to \u201cblackwater events\u201d. The good news, says Birtles, is that water quality in the tributaries of Sydney Harbour has been improving since the 1970s \u2013 the result of stricter regulations and a reduction in industry along the foreshore. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a whole lot of mangroves and oysters coming back,\u201d he said. \u201cIn general, the biodiversity is improving and we\u2019re seeing dolphins and whales and seals moving back into the harbour.\u201d Modelling shows that as the city\u2019s population density increases, \u201cwe could go backwards\u201d, Birtles said. \u201cAs we get more development occurring in the catchment, more hard surfaces, there is risk that that will deliver more pollutants more efficiently to the waterway.\u201d He emphasises the need for well-designed storm water systems, and says Sydney Water is working with local councils to open new swimming sites along the Parramatta River.",

      "bodyText": "The European Union is under pressure to ban the import of kangaroo products following a push from a Dutch animal rights party, a move that if successful could collapse the kangaroo export market. Europe is the largest market for kangaroo meat and leather products. But animal rights activists say that the trade is incompatible with the EU\u2019s animal welfare requirements, and are building opposition to kangaroo products ahead of the EU-Australia free trade agreement. It follows a push to ban the import of kangaroo leather to the US. Legislation to stop the import of kangaroo products was introduced to congress last year but has not progressed. What is happening in Europe? The push to ban kangaroo imports has been led by the Dutch Party for Animals, which is allied with the Animal Justice party in Australia. In 2018 it hosted a screening of an anti-kangaroo hunting film in The Hague, and also hosted New South Wales Animal Justice party MP Mark Pearson, who addressed a group of about 80 people in the European parliament. Last month the Dutch parliament passed a motion from Party for the Animals MP Frank Wassenberg calling on the government to \u201caddress the problem of access to the European market of controversial products such as kangaroo meat and kangaroo products with the European Commission.\u201d Agriculture minister Henk Staghouwer supported the motion, saying that he \u201cshares the concerns expressed\u201d about the commercial kangaroo harvest, but warning that progress on a ban may be slow because it has to comply with trade regulations. The department of foreign affairs defended the commercial kangaroo industry and said Australia was \u201cnegotiating a free trade agreement with the EU that will remove barriers to trade, not put more restrictions on exporters\u201d. All animal products imported to the EU from Australia must be produced in a manner that complies with Australian animal welfare standards and EU import requirements.

Even if you could address other concerns with the trade, says Evans, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you solve the issue of the joeys\u201d. Pearson is a long-term opponent of the commercial kangaroo harvest. In October, a parliamentary inquiry in NSW, of which he was the deputy chair, found issues with the transparency of the methodology used to estimate kangaroo and wallaby populations, and found there was a lack of monitoring and regulation at the point of kill for both commercial and non-commercial operations. The inquiry also found that the NSW parks and wildlife services did not have adequate systems to monitor compliance with licence conditions for non-commercial culling of kangaroos, usually carried out by landholders. \u201cThey don\u2019t know how many kangaroos are out there, they don\u2019t know how many they have killed, they don\u2019t know how they have been killed, and they don\u2019t know how many joeys have been killed,\u201d Pearson told Guardian Australia. He said the trade could not be conducted in a humane manner, because even if all commercial shooters were accurate they must still deal with the joeys. And he said the accuracy of shooters cannot be guaranteed without on-the-ground audits, which are not taking place. \u201cHow can we be assured that these animals are being killed with a clean shot to the brain, when their heads are left on the ground for the pigs and foxes to eat?\u201d he said. Evans says the RSPCA\u2019s concern with commercial kangaroo harvesting was that it was being managed as a renewable resource, not as an ecological measure designed to mitigate adverse outcomes like overpopulation, overgrazing and starvation. She said there had been a lack of national leadership on kangaroo harvesting, leaving behind a complex, polarising debate with few agreed-upon truths. The RSPCA\u2019s position is that an independent evidence-based review, conducted by a body like a national commission for animal welfare, should be tasked to determine the ecological and animal welfare concerns around macropod overpopulation and develop a mitigation strategy \u2013 which may involve commercial harvesting. \u201cThat is what has got to happen first \u2013 you need to assess and provide evidence of the ecological and welfare harms that you are seeking to address, and then you can determine mitigation measures and assess whether those mitigation measures have had the desired effect,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are never going to address this problem if we do not get serious about bringing the right people together and working through this.\u201d Scientists who support commercial kangaroo harvesting say that if Europe were to ban the import, it would remove the most humane method of kangaroo population management, leading to more animals starving due to overgrazing or more animals being killed through non-commercial culls, which are carried out by less-skilled shooters. But leading ecologists have also called for a national kangaroo strategy, which considers population management through the lens of managing the level of resources available in an ecosystem to support kangaroos, and not a quota based on how many animals the industry will take. In January, a collective of Australian ecologists produced a special issue of the journal of Ecological Management and Restoration, focusing on the management of overabundant macropod species. It contained a joint statement, written by eight wildlife scientists, which said that overabundant kangaroo populations must be managed for reasons of both conservation and animal welfare, and that in the absence of dingoes, \u201cregulated and accredited harvesting\u201d was the preferred management method. The statement was endorsed by 25 groups including Bush Heritage Australia, NSW Farmers, the Australian Veterinary Conservation Biology Group, the Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation and the Conservation Council of Australia. Dr John Read, one of the eight authors, told Guardian Australia that commercial kangaroo harvesting was preferable to other outcomes when dealing with overabundant kangaroo populations. He said campaigns by animal rights groups had created a \u201cperverse outcome\u201d for kangaroo welfare. \u201cThere would be less kangaroos being harvested, but that doesn\u2019t slow down the reproduction rate of kangaroos. That means there are more kangaroos than the country can sustain, and if they are not being harvested by commercial hunters then they are either being culled, or they are being poisoned or dying of starvation,\u201d he says. \u201cThey will die a horrible, horrible death.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Allison Mueller was always interested in ceramics but career and family got in the way. Trained in interior design, she worked as a fashion stylist for 30 years. Mueller says the design industry is her \u201cwhole life\u201d. She started playing with clay 10 years ago but it wasn\u2019t until three and a half years ago that she began foundation and intermediate ceramics courses at Tafe. About the same time, her daughters moved out of home. With downsizing on the horizon, she could properly commit herself to clay. She found a place with a \u201clittle studio space out the back\u201d. She painted the space white and built a custom table and bench for her pottery wheel, trimming tools and buckets. Her kiln sits near the door for ventilation, and rows of white shelving display test tiles and drying projects. Vicki Grima, executive officer of the Australian Ceramics Association, has noticed the \u201cslow uptake\u201d in pottery transform into a sharp rise over the last two years. She says Mueller\u2019s story is typical. \u201cThere has always been a trend of hobbyists in the association pivoting from other industries and jobs in their mid-40s to ceramics, to begin community classes.\u201d In the past four years enrolments in ceramics courses at Tafe New South Wales have doubled, says Chris Casali, head teacher of fine arts and ceramics for Tafe\u2019s Sydney region. \u2018Blown away with what you can do\u2019 Pottery students come \u201cat different times in their lives,\u201d Casali says, with needs that vary. While \u201csome want the qualification\u201d, others want \u201cexperimentation with resources\u201d. Despite its newfound popularity, particularly among hobbyists, Casali still says \u201cnot enough people see the capacity of what ceramics has to offer as a career\u201d. \u201cYou can work as an artist, with artists, as an exhibitionist. Many students want a pathway into an arts health practition, like art therapy where clay is used for a whole range of things like motor skills.\u201d Mueller says fashion, homewares and interiors are \u201ccoming into one\u201d with ceramics. She points to the success of the Australian homewares company Mud Ceramics. Since opening in Sydney in 2007, the company has expanded to eight stores globally, from Melbourne to Los Angeles to London. This year it will open a second shop in New York City, along with new stores in Byron Bay and Sydney. Mud\u2019s porcelain clay homewares are still handmade in a studio in Sydney\u2019s Marrickville. \u201cPeople want homeware that is unique, handmade,\u201d Mueller says. \u201cMud are doing amazing things in this space.\u201d But consumers are not the only ones driving the demand for handmade ceramics.

Now these collaborations have \u201cfiltered down to even the local cafes\u201d. \u2018Super bored in lockdown\u2019 Not every person finding a passion for pottery is making a mid-life career pivot. For Nicky Li, a 20-year-old university student in actuarial studies and applied finance, an unexpected lockdown hobby turned into a small business. Feeling \u201csuper bored\u201d in lockdown, Li \u201cdecided to order clay online\u201d after seeing pottery posts on Instagram.

The owner of the property has not been accused of any wrongdoing and is not facing charges.</p> <p>Advocates say the tragedy has once again placed the spotlight on the plight of those living in what are often dilapidated, unsafe homes.</p> <p>Boarding house residents share a kitchen and living space, rarely have their own bathroom, and for these reasons are technically considered homeless by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.</p> <p>But because rooms cater to individuals who may struggle to gain a lease in a private rental, prices can actually be above market rates.</p> <p>\u201cBoarding houses are at the end of the day only ever an option B,\u201d says the Shelter NSW chief executive, John Engeler.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re better than the alternative, rough sleeping, but they\u2019re not an [option] A.\u201d</p> <p>Most residents tend to be older men like Mineall. And like Mineall, about a third are on the disability pension, according to Homelessness NSW chief executive Katherine McKernan, who argues most people are only living in boarding houses due to the \u201cdearth of social housing\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes they have an intellectual disability or another disability that makes it difficult for them to advocate for themselves, so they can be exploited,\u201d says McKernan.</p> <p>Paul Adabie, of the Newtown Neighbourhood Centre, which provides in-reach social services to many boarding house residents in the area, says boarding houses \u201cvary a great deal in quality\u201d.</p> <p>The centre\u2019s chief executive, Liz Yeo, also underlines this point. \u201cIt\u2019s not a sector you can paint with one brush,\u201d says Yeo, whose organisation is widely praised for the work it does with operators to improve conditions.</p> <p>Mineall lived at the Newtown boarding house from 1989 to 2018. He served as the caretaker, meaning he got a \u201cbit off the rent\u201d. He was also responsible for \u201ccollecting the rents, doing a bit of cleaning\u201d, and was sometimes required to inform people they were being evicted. He was sometimes threatened when he did so, he says.</p> <p>Mineall says the house had \u201cdeteriorated a bit\u201d since he left, though he acknowledged repairs had been done on multiple occasions.</p> <p>Yeo described conditions at the property as \u201cterrible\u201d.</p> <p>One issue Mineall pointed to was \u201ca hole in the kitchen roof\u201d. \u201cNearly every time it rained the water would build up and go over to the kitchen and a few bits of stuff would come down,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Guardian Australia does not suggest the condition of the home was a factor in the fatal fire. The Inner West council has confirmed the property had a current fire compliance certificate.</p> <p>In 2012, NSW introduced the Boarding Houses Act, which created a compulsory register and laws governing the rights and responsibilities of occupants and proprietors.</p> <p>McKernan says the legislation itself is \u201crelatively good\u201d. \u201cThe issue is it is not enforced\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/03/wa-had-two-years-to-get-homeless-people-off-the-street-so-why-are-they-still-stranded-as-covid-surges\">WA had two years to get homeless people off the street. So why are they still stranded as Covid surges? | Jesse Noakes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe register hovers around 1,000 boarding houses but we think a lot are unregistered,\u201d says Yeo. The Newtown property ravaged by fire was registered with the government.</p> <p>Another key problem is there is insufficient incentive for local councils to act as a watchdog, say experts.</p> <p>\u201cLocal councils are responsible for regulating but any fines etc go to the state government,\u201d says McKernan. \u201cWhat that means is local government have to invest a lot to regulate and they don\u2019t get any recompense for that. What we\u2019re then relying on is the goodwill \u2026 of the councils.\u201d</p> <p>Chris Martin, a housing policy expert at UNSW, says some are also mindful that closing a place down can mean \u201cmaking a group of people homeless\u201d.</p> <p>Martin would like to see an accreditation regime to regulate who can operate boarding houses.</p> <p>The idea was floated in an ongoing review of the Boarding Houses Act, which is being overhauled to include other similar settings as the \u201cShared Accomodation Act\u201d. Martin says it has not been picked up by government.</p> <p>\u201c[Boarding house operators] are involved in managing relations between multiple people in shared space, which calls for a higher order of skill and capability than individual landlords,\u201d Martin says.</p> <p>\u201cAnd also it is a sector that caters to a relatively vulnerable clientele.\u201d</p> <p>Adabie also backed the idea of a licensing regime, while Engeler, of Shelter NSW, believes only community housing providers should have rights to run boarding houses.</p> <p>Martin also notes the state government discontinued the Boarding House Financial Assistance Program in 2019, which included a specific part of that program on fire safety upgrades.</p> <p>While many outsiders consider boarding houses to be problematic, Newtown Neighbourhood Centre research has found many residents are relatively satisfied. Many judged others as worse off than themselves.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised,\u201d says Adabie. \u201cEven with this fire [in Newtown], people don\u2019t want to go to housing, they want to stay in the boarding house sector because of their history.\u201d</p> <p>Mineall describes his experience as \u201cat times stressful, at times not too bad\u201d. \u201cThere was often a sense of community,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But other times it was tough. \u201cSome of the people would leave their homes in a horrific mess,\u201d he says. \u201cThe mess is one thing I really do remember. I had the job of cleaning up that mess.\u201d</p> <p>Mineall adds that he had \u201ceasily the best room the house\u201d and insisted he got a \u201cpretty good deal\u201d.</p> <p>He still wants to see more regulation of the sector. \u201cI really think boarding houses should be inspected a bit more often,\u201d he says. \u201cThere should be more stringent rules applied.\u201d</p> <p>Mineall is now in a home run by Anglicare, which he says he much prefers. It is still a shared property, but there are staff on hand to help the residents.</p> <p>If it weren\u2019t for the social housing shortage, though, he might have his own place.</p> <p>About five years ago he enquired about social housing at an office in Broadway and \u201cwas told it was a 15-year wait\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI looked at the calendar, and I thought, \u2018Fifteen years, I\u2019m going to be 75 by the time I get into housing commission,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cSo I pulled the pin on that pretty quick.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ian Mineall was listening to talkback radio on Tuesday morning when he learned of a fire at a boarding house on Probert Street, Newtown, in Sydney\u2019s inner west. \u201cI know two boarding houses on that street,\u201d he says. He hoped it wasn\u2019t his old place. \u201cIt was.\u201d The shocking inferno at the 14-room Vadja House left three people dead. Eight residents managed to escape, including one 80-year-old man who was in a critical condition after jumping out of a window before having a heart attack. Police have since charged a former resident with three counts of murder and one count of destroying or damaging property by fire or explosive. The owner of the property has not been accused of any wrongdoing and is not facing charges. Advocates say the tragedy has once again placed the spotlight on the plight of those living in what are often dilapidated, unsafe homes. Boarding house residents share a kitchen and living space, rarely have their own bathroom, and for these reasons are technically considered homeless by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. But because rooms cater to individuals who may struggle to gain a lease in a private rental, prices can actually be above market rates. \u201cBoarding houses are at the end of the day only ever an option B,\u201d says the Shelter NSW chief executive, John Engeler. \u201cThey\u2019re better than the alternative, rough sleeping, but they\u2019re not an [option] A.\u201d Most residents tend to be older men like Mineall. And like Mineall, about a third are on the disability pension, according to Homelessness NSW chief executive Katherine McKernan, who argues most people are only living in boarding houses due to the \u201cdearth of social housing\u201d. \u201cSometimes they have an intellectual disability or another disability that makes it difficult for them to advocate for themselves, so they can be exploited,\u201d says McKernan. Paul Adabie, of the Newtown Neighbourhood Centre, which provides in-reach social services to many boarding house residents in the area, says boarding houses \u201cvary a great deal in quality\u201d. The centre\u2019s chief executive, Liz Yeo, also underlines this point. \u201cIt\u2019s not a sector you can paint with one brush,\u201d says Yeo, whose organisation is widely praised for the work it does with operators to improve conditions. Mineall lived at the Newtown boarding house from 1989 to 2018. He served as the caretaker, meaning he got a \u201cbit off the rent\u201d. He was also responsible for \u201ccollecting the rents, doing a bit of cleaning\u201d, and was sometimes required to inform people they were being evicted. He was sometimes threatened when he did so, he says. Mineall says the house had \u201cdeteriorated a bit\u201d since he left, though he acknowledged repairs had been done on multiple occasions. Yeo described conditions at the property as \u201cterrible\u201d. One issue Mineall pointed to was \u201ca hole in the kitchen roof\u201d. \u201cNearly every time it rained the water would build up and go over to the kitchen and a few bits of stuff would come down,\u201d he says. Guardian Australia does not suggest the condition of the home was a factor in the fatal fire. The Inner West council has confirmed the property had a current fire compliance certificate. In 2012, NSW introduced the Boarding Houses Act, which created a compulsory register and laws governing the rights and responsibilities of occupants and proprietors. McKernan says the legislation itself is \u201crelatively good\u201d. \u201cThe issue is it is not enforced\u201d. \u201cThe register hovers around 1,000 boarding houses but we think a lot are unregistered,\u201d says Yeo. The Newtown property ravaged by fire was registered with the government. Another key problem is there is insufficient incentive for local councils to act as a watchdog, say experts. \u201cLocal councils are responsible for regulating but any fines etc go to the state government,\u201d says McKernan. \u201cWhat that means is local government have to invest a lot to regulate and they don\u2019t get any recompense for that. What we\u2019re then relying on is the goodwill \u2026 of the councils.\u201d Chris Martin, a housing policy expert at UNSW, says some are also mindful that closing a place down can mean \u201cmaking a group of people homeless\u201d. Martin would like to see an accreditation regime to regulate who can operate boarding houses. The idea was floated in an ongoing review of the Boarding Houses Act, which is being overhauled to include other similar settings as the \u201cShared Accomodation Act\u201d. Martin says it has not been picked up by government. \u201c[Boarding house operators] are involved in managing relations between multiple people in shared space, which calls for a higher order of skill and capability than individual landlords,\u201d Martin says. \u201cAnd also it is a sector that caters to a relatively vulnerable clientele.\u201d Adabie also backed the idea of a licensing regime, while Engeler, of Shelter NSW, believes only community housing providers should have rights to run boarding houses. Martin also notes the state government discontinued the Boarding House Financial Assistance Program in 2019, which included a specific part of that program on fire safety upgrades. While many outsiders consider boarding houses to be problematic, Newtown Neighbourhood Centre research has found many residents are relatively satisfied. Many judged others as worse off than themselves. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised,\u201d says Adabie. \u201cEven with this fire [in Newtown], people don\u2019t want to go to housing, they want to stay in the boarding house sector because of their history.\u201d Mineall describes his experience as \u201cat times stressful, at times not too bad\u201d. \u201cThere was often a sense of community,\u201d he says. But other times it was tough. \u201cSome of the people would leave their homes in a horrific mess,\u201d he says. \u201cThe mess is one thing I really do remember. I had the job of cleaning up that mess.\u201d Mineall adds that he had \u201ceasily the best room the house\u201d and insisted he got a \u201cpretty good deal\u201d. He still wants to see more regulation of the sector. \u201cI really think boarding houses should be inspected a bit more often,\u201d he says. \u201cThere should be more stringent rules applied.\u201d Mineall is now in a home run by Anglicare, which he says he much prefers. It is still a shared property, but there are staff on hand to help the residents. If it weren\u2019t for the social housing shortage, though, he might have his own place. About five years ago he enquired about social housing at an office in Broadway and \u201cwas told it was a 15-year wait\u201d. \u201cI looked at the calendar, and I thought, \u2018Fifteen years, I\u2019m going to be 75 by the time I get into housing commission,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cSo I pulled the pin on that pretty quick.\u201d",

Debt to the Housing Authority is a frequent complaint. Those who are barred from access to housing thanks to such debt often lodge with other family members who have existing public housing tenancies, leading to overcrowding. The overcrowding increases the likelihood of damages to the property or neighbour complaints against the tenant, which in turn increases the likelihood of further debt or eviction.</p> <p>Eligibility for public housing is already restricted to those on the lowest of incomes, and repayment plans for these debts \u2013 required in many cases for prospective tenants to become eligible again \u2013 diminish already meagre incomes even further.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Haven\u2019t you guys really got a heart?</p> <footer> <cite>Nannette Knapp</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The situation of tenants is made even more precarious by the Housing Authority\u2019s controversial disruptive behaviour management policy, known as the \u201cthree strikes\u201d policy, which allows them to evict tenants who have had three strike notices issued against them. An <a href=\"https://audit.wa.gov.au/reports-and-publications/reports/managing-disruptive-behaviour-in-public-housing/introduction-and-background/\">audit of the policy in 2018</a> found that \u201ca more holistic approach to tenancy management is needed if the department is to reduce disruptive behaviour incidents from occurring in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>The WA Department of Communities told Guardian Australia that as of 28 February 2022, there were 15,316 current public housing tenancy accounts in debt to the Housing Authority. Last financial year, there were 35,279 public housing dwellings in WA, which suggests there is debt attached to at least 43% people holding public housing tenancies in the state.</p> <p>At the same time, 8,842 former tenants also have a debt to the Housing Authority. The average debt for a former tenant was $4,936. The primary causes of debt, according to Communities, were non-payment of rent, non-payment of utility bills and costs charged for removal of rubbish following vacation of a tenancy.</p> <p>A spokesperson from Communities says that Knapp was engaged with support programs throughout her tenancy that were aimed to \u201cincrease the capacity of a tenant to independently sustain their tenancy\u201d.</p> <h2>\u2018Why did they throw us out?\u2019</h2> <p>Last year, with the assistance of advocates, Knapp appealed her debt. On 17 November 2021, that appeal was upheld and vacated tenant liability charges of $20,519.90 were waived. The tribunal\u2019s decision was not made on an empathetic basis; the finding cited only the failure of housing authorities to abide by an administrative obligation in the Tenancies Act. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"55b9c2f9427d110adfac9a163bbf8d140109527d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55b9c2f9427d110adfac9a163bbf8d140109527d/2845_0_4403_5504/800.jpg\" alt=\"Nannette Knapp\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nannette Knapp: \u2018People need to know what they\u2019re doing to us.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Dare Parker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now 53 years old and a grandmother, Knapp is still swimming against a relentless tide.

You can\u2019t \u2018try hard\u2019 against those odds.\u201d In one of many letters to the WA Department of Communities on behalf of Knapp, Buchanan wrote: \u201cIt is my belief that the enormous debts raised by the department against the poorest people in our community are an unjust and discriminatory bar to Aboriginal access to housing.\u201d Guardian Australia has separately spoken to numerous Aboriginal people living homeless in Western Australia. Debt to the Housing Authority is a frequent complaint. Those who are barred from access to housing thanks to such debt often lodge with other family members who have existing public housing tenancies, leading to overcrowding. The overcrowding increases the likelihood of damages to the property or neighbour complaints against the tenant, which in turn increases the likelihood of further debt or eviction. Eligibility for public housing is already restricted to those on the lowest of incomes, and repayment plans for these debts \u2013 required in many cases for prospective tenants to become eligible again \u2013 diminish already meagre incomes even further. The situation of tenants is made even more precarious by the Housing Authority\u2019s controversial disruptive behaviour management policy, known as the \u201cthree strikes\u201d policy, which allows them to evict tenants who have had three strike notices issued against them. An audit of the policy in 2018 found that \u201ca more holistic approach to tenancy management is needed if the department is to reduce disruptive behaviour incidents from occurring in the first place.\u201d The WA Department of Communities told Guardian Australia that as of 28 February 2022, there were 15,316 current public housing tenancy accounts in debt to the Housing Authority. Last financial year, there were 35,279 public housing dwellings in WA, which suggests there is debt attached to at least 43% people holding public housing tenancies in the state. At the same time, 8,842 former tenants also have a debt to the Housing Authority. The average debt for a former tenant was $4,936. The primary causes of debt, according to Communities, were non-payment of rent, non-payment of utility bills and costs charged for removal of rubbish following vacation of a tenancy. A spokesperson from Communities says that Knapp was engaged with support programs throughout her tenancy that were aimed to \u201cincrease the capacity of a tenant to independently sustain their tenancy\u201d. \u2018Why did they throw us out?\u2019 Last year, with the assistance of advocates, Knapp appealed her debt. On 17 November 2021, that appeal was upheld and vacated tenant liability charges of $20,519.90 were waived. The tribunal\u2019s decision was not made on an empathetic basis; the finding cited only the failure of housing authorities to abide by an administrative obligation in the Tenancies Act. Now 53 years old and a grandmother, Knapp is still swimming against a relentless tide. She still owes the Housing Authority more than $4,000 in rental arrears, utilities and other charges, which her advocates estimate will take her seven years to pay. Her only income is jobseeker, which is fraught with administrative burdens as she is constantly having to prove that her back injury prevents her from working. Even if she could work, she says, how could she be expected to find a job without a permanent home? \u201cYou can\u2019t look for work if you haven\u2019t got a house to go back to. I can\u2019t work for my health reasons and mobility. I was told I could study online but I don\u2019t have a computer. And I am just so poor,\u201d she says. Last year Knapp was advised that she has been allowed back onto the public housing waitlist and has been given a priority listing. So far, though, she has not received a house. \u201cPeople need to know what they\u2019re doing to us,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought it was just awful when Cody was just sick. Why did they throw us out when Cody still needed home care? The government need to be accountable. Haven\u2019t you guys really got a heart?\u201d",

It is a key supplier of aluminium, copper, nickel, platinum, palladium and titanium. Russia and Ukraine supply up to 80 to 90% of neon gas used in lasers to make semiconductors. They produce large quantities of cereals, including almost 25% of the world\u2019s wheat, and oilseeds for human and livestock consumption. Loss of all or part of this supply will affect production and prices. Oil, gas, wheat, palladium and nickel prices have gone parabolic. Without rapid de-escalation, sustained high commodity prices may reduce global growth by 1% and add up to 3% to inflation. Australian energy producers and farmers may benefit, although supply constraints limit opportunities and higher transport costs will reduce gains. Farmers face shortages and higher prices for fertiliser because Russia is responsible for around 20% of each global potash and ammonia supply. For consumers, as the Reserve Bank of Australia governor, Philip Lowe, has warned, the conflict could trigger new waves of inflation and higher interest rates. If wage rises do not match price increases, then Australians will see a diminution of purchasing power. Trade restrictions and sanctions targeting Russia may be ineffective. They assume US and western dominance of global commerce, but Russia and its ally China are important suppliers of energy, raw materials and many manufactured and intermediate goods. China and Russia have technological and financial workarounds which allow them to somewhat mitigate the effect of sanctions. There could be economic blowback from retaliatory measures. Restricting Russian access to the global banking system may rebound. Foreign investors are owed at least US$150bn (AU$208bn): around US$20bn (AU$28bn) of Russia\u2019s dollar debt, US$41bn (AU$57bn) in rouble-denominated sovereign bonds and US$86bn (AU$119bn) of shares. With Russia unable or unwilling to make payments, much of this could be lost. Businesses forced to close operations or divest will not recover their investment. For example, BP\u2019s disposal of its stake in Rosneft may result in a write-down of up to US$14bn (AU$19bn). Russia might also seize foreign business assets or not return about 500 aircraft, valued at US$10bn (AU$14bn), leased from western firms. Western automobile, aerospace and technology firms face loss of income from reduced access to the Russian market. Australian savings, via investment funds, are exposed modestly to Russian shares and debt but more significantly to firms directly or indirectly affected by developments. Volatile share markets are pricing in losses and the broader dislocation. The larger exposure is through the banking system, which has extended credit to Russia as well as businesses that are affected by sanctions, volatile commodity prices and a slowing economy. Banks, mainly European and American, have already foreshadowed multi-billion dollar write-downs. Problems may cascade through the hyper-connected financial system creating a daisy chain of losses setting off a financial crisis. The inevitable geopolitical realignment will have significant costs. There is the loss of the \u201cpeace dividend\u201d which allowed lower defence spending. Alongside the US and EU, Australia plans to substantially increase defence spending. While benefiting defence contractors, higher military expenditure will divert resources from more productive uses, such as health, education, social services, infrastructure and strategic investments. It will place additional stress on already fragile public finances in many countries battered by the pandemic. Since 1989, the dissolution of cold war alliances and improved security allowed increased global trade and capital flows. The trend is now to closed economies, economic nationalism and self-sufficiency. A fragmented global economy and rising barriers to trade and cross-border investment may result in lower incomes and more expensive goods and services. Sanctions and the seizure of central bank assets can set dangerous precedents. The weaponisation of trade and financial relationships between nations will slow long-term growth and development. It will also produce lasting suspicions and tensions which will prevent cooperation on global issues like the environment and pandemics. Australia, as an open economy, is especially vulnerable. Closer Sino-Russian ties may decrease Australia\u2019s export opportunities. \u201cYou may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you.\u201d The aphorism attributed to Leon Trotsky captures the far-reaching consequences of conflicts. Trapped by historical alliances, Australia is not immune to a fracturing global economic and political order. \u2022 Satyajit Das is author of the recently released Fortune\u2019s Fool: Australia\u2019s Choices (March 2022) and A Banquet of Consequences \u2013 Reloaded (March 2021)",

Updates throughout Ukraine indicated little change in frontline positions, with hotspots in the southern cities of Kherson and Mykolaiv \u2013 where scores of bodies were still being pulled from the rubble after a missile strike on a Ukrainian barracks \u2013 as well as Mariupol. Capturing the port would grant the Russians the entire northern coast of the Sea of Azov, cutting Ukraine off from a conduit to the Black Sea, while allowing the Kremlin to build a land corridor to Crimea, the peninsula it illegally annexed in 2014. In the capital Kyiv, Russian plans to surround the capital were still seemingly far from being realised. Latest Ukrainian defence assessments indicated that 35 markets and 635 shops remained open, with the city looking to withstand a possible siege. However, some Russian elements have managed to breach its defences. Ukrainian forces in Kyiv announced they had so far detained 127 \u201csaboteurs\u201d, including 14 infiltration groups, since the Russian invasion began. One alarming development was Russia\u2019s use of sophisticated hypersonic missiles \u2013 capable of avoiding air defences \u2013 to strike an underground weapons storage unit in western Ukraine. Defence experts warned this had \u201cthe means to escalate\u201d the conflict further as the Ukrainian army would be unable to defend itself against attacks by such missiles.The use of these weapons preceded new attempts to resolve the fighting. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for \u201cmeaningful and fair\u201d talks with Moscow. Appearing to try to use Putin\u2019s sluggish military progress as a reason for talks, Zelenskiy warned it would take Russia \u201cseveral generations\u201d to recover from its losses in the war. But Putin accused Ukraine of stalling by submitting unrealistic proposals, in a call with the German chancellor Olaf Scholz. Elsewhere, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, accused the US of dissuading Kyiv from agreeing to Russia\u2019s demands, although he did not provide any evidence to support the claim. Most western analysts believe the Russian forces have already suffered significant losses. Western officials claim to have evidence of dwindling morale among Russian fighters, as well as of severe logistical issues. Ukrainian forces claim that they have killed a fifth Russian general, Lieutenant General Andrei Mordvichev. If this is true, he would be the most senior Russian commander killed in the conflict so far.",

Neita ultimately decided to leave Reider\u2019s training camp in Florida after the Guardian revealed that he was being investigated by US SafeSport after multiple allegations of sexual abuse were made against him. Another British athlete, Laviai Nielsen, also decided to leave last month. However Adam Gemili chose to stay and so lost his right to up to \u00a328,000 a year in lottery funding and medical support. But, for Neita, the way it was handled has left a bad taste. \u201cI didn\u2019t move due to the federation,\u201d she said at the world indoor Championships. \u201cI don\u2019t actually agree with the way they handled the situation, to be honest. \u201cIf you\u2019re worried about the safeguarding of athletes you shouldn\u2019t be blackmailed with funding. I think that\u2019s two completely different things. It kind of felt like the federation just wanted to cover their backs in a way, which I completely understand. I just feel like\u201a \u2018do you care if I stay?

      "body": "<p>Charlotte Philby, 39, is a former investigative reporter and the author of three critically acclaimed spy novels. She is also the granddaughter of Kim Philby, the notorious double-agent known as \u201cthe third man\u201d in the Cambridge spy ring. Her fourth novel, <em>Edith and Kim</em>, tells the linked stories of her grandfather and Edith Tudor-Hart, a Jewish photojournalist born in Vienna, who studied at the Bauhaus, married an Englishman, worked as a Soviet agent in London and introduced Kim to his Russian handler. Philby lives in Bristol with her husband and three children.</p> <p><strong>Putting real historical characters into a novel is a minefield, especially those who existed within living memory. How much more so when it\u2019s your own family?<br></strong>My relationship to my grandfather is complex and constantly evolving. I\u2019m conscious that his story belongs to different people in different ways, within our family and also more widely. I think part of the appeal of writing this book was trying to reconcile the ways in which I\u2019ve come to understand him: as a grandfather; a father; a friend; a traitor; an idealist. But I had to find the right way to approach it. When I happened upon the story of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/21/how-mi5-failed-to-expose-matriarch-of-cambridge-spy-ring\">Edith Tudor-Hart</a>, I knew that she was the person I had to write about. She\u2019s always cast as a bit player if she\u2019s mentioned at all, but she was a remarkable woman. Anthony Blunt referred to her as \u201cthe grandmother of the Cambridge spies\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My relationship to my grandfather is complex and constantly evolving</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Why do you think she has been overlooked?<br></strong>Partly because her files were only released to the National Archive in 2015. But more generally women\u2019s roles in espionage have been sidelined, and I wonder if that\u2019s because a lot of this history has been recorded by men. When you look at the way Edith is referred to in the [security service\u2019s] files as \u201cthat foreign woman\u201d, I wonder whether there\u2019s a sense of embarrassment too. It was bad enough with Kim and the Cambridge spies showing up the British establishment, but the idea that this foreign Jewish woman might run rings around men in positions of authority, perhaps that was embarrassing for them.</p> <p><strong>She\u2019s a sympathetic character in the novel. Did you feel that as you uncovered her story?<br></strong>I feel a huge amount of sympathy for her situation, and admiration, really. And sadness. She was incredibly brave, incredibly loyal; she was completely faithful to the things she loved and believed in, and she had a firm belief that she had to do the right thing. Regardless of what I think of her ideology, I greatly admire the fact that she was able to hold these various parts of her life \u2013 being a photographer, being a single mother \u2013 alongside being a revolutionary, feeling that she could change the world.</p> <p><strong>Were you always aware that your family had this extraordinary history? Did your father, John, talk about his father?<br></strong>We never had a family meeting where he said: \u201cRight, I\u2019m going to explain to you who your grandfather was.\u201d That was not at all the kind of person he was. But we visited Kim in Moscow and those holidays form some of my earliest memories, so it wasn\u2019t like he was a secret. He was my grandfather, and then as I grew older it became apparent that he was someone else, too. Recently I found a paparazzo shot of my dad with a suitcase getting into a car and me, aged five, looking into the camera, and I had this moment of recognition. That was my dad leaving to go to Kim\u2019s funeral [in 1988] and we were hounded by paparazzi. I remember at the time feeling that something very dark was happening and that I didn\u2019t feel safe.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I feel as if I have been through some form of therapy, I\u2019ve purged these questions in a way</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>How easy did you find it to capture Kim\u2019s voice?<br></strong>I spent so long with his letters and they gave me such an insight into the expressions he used, the way he spoke, how he flipped between being tender and reflective and witty and scathing, and his very English obsession with the weather. I love those images of him as a real person; for me, that\u2019s where the clues as to who he really was can be found. A large amount of the letters in the book are lifted verbatim from those.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve written three previous novels about espionage and betrayal \u2013 did you need to approach that world obliquely before tackling Kim\u2019s story?<br></strong>I was adamant that I didn\u2019t want to write about Kim because ironically I didn\u2019t want to define myself through his life. But they were quasi-spy novels so I ended up talking about them in relation to his story anyway. I think I\u2019ve spent so long having other people project their versions of my grandfather \u2013 and my family \u2013 on to me that writing about it is a way of trying to reclaim the story. There are so many ways that Kim\u2019s choices have continued to occupy my mind since my dad died in 2009, but I do feel that this book draws a line under it.

      "bodyText": "Phew. That\u2019s it for another busy clockwatch. Thanks for your company and emails - and please do join Simon Burnton for the FA Cup quarter-final between Middlesbrough and Chelsea. Goodnight! Peep peep! It\u2019s full time in all the 3pm games. Here are some of the more notable scorelines: Championship Huddersfield 0-3 Bournemouth Hull 1-3 Luton Reading 1-0 Blackburn Stoke 2-0 Millwall League One Oxford 1-1 Ipswich (A 95th-minute equaliser from Luke McNally) Rotherham 0-3 Shrewsbury Wigan 4-1 Morecambe Scottish Premiership Celtic 4-0 Ross County (Giakoumakis hat-trick, again) And you can get all the other results on our live scores page. Full time: Hull 1-3 Luton Tom Eaves scored a late consolation for the home side, but it shouldn\u2019t tarnish another excellent afternoon for Luton. They are up to third in the Championship. That\u2019s an emphatic statement victory from Bournemouth, who are now strong favourites to go up automatically with Fulham. \u201cOn that note, what to make of players like Dele Alli?\u201d says Yash Gupta. \u201cSomeone who was unplayable. Did his peak come too early? Bit like Rooney although Rooney\u2019s level was still very high after initial hell of a burst.\u201d I have no idea what has happened there, but it\u2019s really sad to watch. He played pretty well against Liverpool just before Christmas, and I thought that might be the beginning of a renaissance. How wrong was I. League One Elliott Bennett\u2019s goal has made it Rotherham 0-2 Shrewsbury, a result that approximately 0.00 per cent of us saw coming. But Shrewsbury fully deserve their victory. Stuttgart 3-2 Augsburg \u201cHello Rob,\u201d says K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cIt\u2019s not a featured game, but in the Bundesliga relegation six pointer, Stuttgart came back from 2-1 in the last ten minutes to win 3-2 against Augsburg, rising out of the relegation zone for the first time in gadzoinks, albeit on goal difference. But as a long-suffering Stuttgart fan, I\u2019ll take what I can get.\u201d A huge goal at the Select Car Leasing Stadium, and yes that really is its name. Josh Laurent has put Reading ahead against goal-shy Blackburn, and if it stays like they will be five points clear of the relegation places. Bundesliga scores Those are vital wins for Stuttgart and Hertha Berlin in particular. It\u2019s so tight at the bottom, with one point separating four teams in the fight to avoid relegation. \u201cThe Catalan Adel Taarabt is a stunning talent who has always struggled with the idea that football is a team sport,\u201d says Phil Podolsky of Gerard Deulofeu. \u201cSadly, mid-size clubs is as good as it gets for this type of player these days, though the streets won\u2019t forget etc.\u201d I like creative players who only reach that level, the football equivalent of a cult band. You know who I mean. The Longpigs, Jonathan Fire*Eater. Northern Uproar. Reading 0-0 Blackburn Sam Gallagher has just missed a great chance for Blackburn, whose goals have dried up horribly. Since the turn of the year they\u2019ve scored six goals in 15 league games, and three of those came in one game against Derby last week. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cJust digesting a painfully well-deserved Italian win in that other sport. Ouch. Ah well. Glad to hear Solanke is on the scoresheet, and it would be tremendous if Luton could stick around in the play-off places. Seems genuinely amazing they\u2019re where they are. As a neutral, I really hope they can keep going and make it to the Premier League, just to see a different name in the table.\u201d And a different kit. Imagine if they turned up sporting this beauty. Talking of which, James Bree has just scored a spectacular free-kick to put Luton 3-0 up at Hull. League One The leaders Rotherham are still a goal down and a man down at home to Shrewsbury. Stephen Humphrys has just put Wigan 4-1 up at home to Morecambe. As things stand, Wigan are a point behind Rotherham with two games in hand. The in-form MK Dons lead 1-0 at Cambridge; they are right in the mix for automatic promotion. The FA Cup quarter-finals get under way this evening with Middlesbrough v Chelsea. Simon Burnton has the team news for that one. I\u2019m surprised it took so long: the outstanding Georgios Giakoumakis has completed his second hat-trick in as many home games. The first two were headers in the first half; the third was a penalty. GOAL! Hull 0-2 Luton (Cornick 56) Luton look set to go third in the table. Harry Cornick has doubled their lead away to Hull, who haven\u2019t scored a goal at home since January. Reading 0-0 Blackburn It\u2019s been a frustrating afternoon for Blackburn, who are without the prolific Ben Brereton Diaz. Any chance of automatic promotion will probably be gone if they don\u2019t win today. Championship roundup Here\u2019s more on the early games in the Championship: Derby 1-1 Coventry and Sheffield United 2-0 Barnsley. This is turning into an extremely good day for Bournemouth. A brilliant goal from Dominic Solanke has put them 3-0 up at third-placed Huddersfield. It\u2019s all over in Naples, where the home side came from behind to earn a vital victory. The superb Victor Osimhen scored twice in the second half to move Napoli level on points with AC Milan, who play Cagliari tonight, at the top of the table. It\u2019s half-time in the 3pm games. Celtic are hammering 10-man Ross County, while Bournemouth are 2-0 up at Huddersfield in the Championship\u2019s big game. You can peruse all the half-time scores here. League One: Wigan 2-0 Morecambe Wigan, second in League One, are on course for another victory. Josh Magennis and Jason Kerr have put them 2-0 up against Morecambe. It\u2019s a slightly flattering scoreline, but I doubt they\u2019ll care about that. Napoli 2-1 Udinese There\u2019s been a red card in Naples too. Pablo Mari, on loan to Udinese from Arsenal, has been advised to do one by the referee. League One: Rotherham 0-1 Shrewsbury A bit of a surprise at the place we are apparently supposed to call the AESSEAL New York Stadium: the leaders Rotherham have gone behind to a goal from Daniel Udoh. And according to Chris Kamara on Soccer Saturday, Shrewsbury fully deserve their lead. Edit: it gets worse for Rotherham, who have had Angus MacDonald sent off. Celtic 3-0 Ross County It gets worse for Ross County: Kayne Ramsay had been given a straight red card for a dangerous challenge on Tom Rogic. Lord knows how many Giakoumakis will score today. A comedy of errors in the Huddersfield area leads to a second Bournemouth goal, scored by Jefferson Lerma. As things stand they have a six-point cushion in second place, with at least two games in hand on the teams directly below them. Game over at Celtic Park, if it was ever on in the first place. Daizen Maeda has made it three for Celtic, who are going six points clear at the top. Rangers play at Dundee tomorrow, and then the two teams meet in a humdinger on 3 April. The latest scores in our featured games Premier League Aston Villa 0-1 Arsenal (FT) Championship Derby 1-1 Coventry (FT) Huddersfield 0-1 Bournemouth Reading 0-0 Blackburn Scottish Premiership Celtic 2-0 Ross County Serie A Napoli 2-1 Udinese (2pm) Napoli have come from behind to lead Udinese, with the brilliant Victor Osimhen getting both goals. Yes I did miss his equaliser 15 minutes ago - sorry. Meanwhile, in Germany The Mainz goal came after 27 seconds of the game. Georgios Giakoumakis gets his second! He is in sensational form at the moment - that\u2019s his seventh goal in the last four-and-a-bit games. Bournemouth take the lead at the John Smith\u2019s Stadium. It was a lovely team goal, finished off by Jaidon Anthony. A win today would make Bournemouth strong favourites to go up automatically alongside Fulham. The in-form Georgios Giakoumakis heads Celtic into the lead after some fine wingplay from Jota. Hull 0-1 Luton Fifth-placed Luton have taken an early lead at Hull through Elijah Adebayo. He\u2019s been quiet of late but that\u2019s an important goal. Luton back in the top flight would be a helluva Proustian rush. These are the latest/final scores in our featured games. It will get livelier, I promise. Premier League Aston Villa 0-1 Arsenal (FT) Championship Derby 1-1 Coventry (FT) Huddersfield 0-0 Bournemouth Reading 0-0 Blackburn Scottish Premiership Celtic 0-0 Ross County Serie A Napoli 0-1 Udinese (2pm) Nostalgia corner (part 2) On this day in 1986, Steve Archibald puts the holders Juventus out of the European Cup. Peep peep! The 3pm games are under way. May football be the winner, now and forever. Half time: Napoli 0-1 Udinese If Napoli don\u2019t win Serie A, it\u2019ll be their home form that costs them. They are enduring another difficult afternoon against Udinese, who lead through a classy finish from Gerard Deulofeu. Could he be any more likeable? (Clue: no) Aston Villa 0-1 Arsenal Here\u2019s Nick Ames\u2019 report on another very good day for Arsenal. \u201cHello Rob,\u201d says K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cI\u2019ve had a soft spot for Gerard Deulofeu for years, so I like seeing him score. He may lack consistency, but it\u2019s never for lack of trying, and he\u2019s always fun to watch. From the games I\u2019ve seen him play this season, he seems to fit in at Udinese really well. It was a good goal too, dipping into the bottom left corner from just outside the box.\u201d When he\u2019s good, he\u2019s very, very good\u2026 actually, it must be so frustrating to be a creative player who struggles for consistency. With most weaknesses you can work on certain things, but I don\u2019t know how you go about becoming more consistent. Bukayo Saka\u2019s goal gves Arsenal an excellent victory at Villa Park. It\u2019s their 10th win in the last 13 Premier League games. They\u2019re now four points clear of fifth-placed Manchester United with a game in hand. Hello. The Premier League\u2019s old friend Gerard Deulofeu has given Udinese a surprise lead in Naples. Full time: Sheffield United 2-0 Barnsley Sheffield United move up to fourth after a relatively comfortable win over Barnsley. Sander Berge and Morgan Gibbs-White scored the goals in the second half. An entertaining game ends all square, which is not the greatest result for either side. Derby stay in 23rd, Coventry are still 11th. Derby 1-1 Coventry (90+1 min) Late drama at Pride Park, where the young Derby substitute Louie Sibley has headed against the post in injury time! Celtic v Ross County team news Derby 1-1 Coventry (82 min) It\u2019s nip and tuck at Pride Park, where a winning goal for either team would be priceless. The Derby keeper Ryan Allsop has just made an outstanding save with his legs to deny Viktor Gyokeres. Reading v Blackburn team news Huddersfield v Bournemouth team news GOAL! Sheffield United 2-0 Barnsley (Gibbs-White 77) That should be enough for United. Morgan Gibbs-White runs onto a return pass from Oli McBurnie and walks round Bradley Collins to score. As things stand, United are fourth in the table; that\u2019s good going for a team who were 14th at Christmas. How to take a penalty, part 14 in an ongoing series Aston Villa 0-1 Arsenal Arsenal still lead at Villa Park with just over 20 minutes remaining. You can follow that game with Simon Burnton. Tom Lawrence wins and then scores a penalty to bring Derby level! The decision was on the soft side; the actual kick could not have been more emphatic. Nostalgia corner On this day in 1994, Eric Cantona mistook John Moncur for a tap dance mat. And on the same day, Ian Wright flaunted his goalscoring genius. The second goal is a gem. Barney Ronay on Erling Haaland This is well worth your time. Sheffield United 1-0 Barnsley Sander Berge has given the home side the lead in the other early game. That\u2019s an important goal at both ends, with United pushing for promotion and Barnsley fighting to avoid a one-way ticket to League One. Championship: Derby 0-1 Coventry (53 min) Lots of Derby pressure at the staart of the second half. They\u2019ve already had a decent penalty appeal turned down and now they had a free-kick right on the edge of the D. Tom Lawrence hoofs it straight into the wall. Napoli v Udinese team news Napoli will go top, for a few hours at least, if they win this afternoon. The leaders AC Milan are at Cagliari tonight. Half time: Derby 0-1 Coventry Coventry, who are 11th in the Championship but still right in the mix for promotion, lead at Derby through a quite brilliant goal from Matt Godden. Pick this out. There\u2019s another lunchtime kick-off in the Championship at Bramall Lane, where the half-time score is Sheffield United 0-0 Barnsley. Half time: Aston Villa 0-1 Arsenal Bukayo Saka\u2019s goal has given Arsenal the lead at Villa Park. It\u2019s the least they deserve for another dominant, swaggering performance. You can follow the second half of that game with Simon Burnton. Hello and welcome to another Saturday afternoon clockwatch. There are no 3pm games in the Premier League or FA Cup but there\u2019s still plenty going on.

The Scuderia are delivering on their pre-season promise with Carlos Sainz also claiming third place.</p> \n<p>For the sport\u2019s previously dominant team, qualifying was a sobering experience. Mercedes are floundering and there is no quick fix in sight.</p> \n<p>For eight consecutive years the constructors\u2019 champions, this is the hardest start they have endured since 2013. Hamilton was in fifth place, a full six-tenths down on Leclerc, with his teammate George Russell in ninth.</p> \n<p>Hamilton, the seven-time world champion, pulled no punches in his assessment. \u201cThose guys ahead of us are in another league,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m generally really happy today. Given how we\u2019ve been the last few weeks and the problems we\u2019ve had with the car, it\u2019s a bit of a nightmare to drive.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nor did he expect any great turnaround in race pace. \u201cThose guys will be going away,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not in the fight with those guys. My battle is with the guys behind most likely.\u201d</p> \n<p>The problems facing Mercedes will not be solved overnight. Their car is suffering from what is known as porpoising, bouncing induced by a break in downforce on straights. If Hamilton is to earn an eighth title he will have to do it the hard way.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b830e6e3e3c94781372d7d176a5e17be70c0363\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b830e6e3e3c94781372d7d176a5e17be70c0363/0_5_5315_3189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lewis Hamilton during qualifying\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lewis Hamilton could only manage fifth on the grid as his Mercedes car struggled with a porpoising problem.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ali Haider/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For Ferrari, who have not challenged toward the front since 2019, having completely shifted their focus last year to the 2022 model built to the all-new regulations, their plan has paid off in spades.</p> \n<p>Red Bull are right on their tail, however, and on another day Verstappen, who was a tenth back, might have had the edge. A nip and tuck fight between the two teams can be expected in the race on Sunday. Leclerc and Verstappen, both elbows-out drivers, are likely to be uncompromising with one another into turn one.</p> \n<p>On the first truly competitive run for these brand new cars, unleashed on low fuel and with their engines turned up, Leclerc held a slender advantage. For the final decisive laps in Q3 he was hooked up and put in an almighty lap with a time of 1min 30.558sec. Much as Verstappen attacked he could not match it,. A jubilant Leclerc revelled in what he had felt was the real potential of his car but noted ominously that he felt there was more to come.</p> \n<p>It is Leclerc\u2019s 10th pole position and Ferrari\u2019s first since he took the top spot in Baku last year. The Mon\u00e9gasque driver is in every position to try to convert it with good form at the Bahrain International Circuit. He took pole here and was conformably leading in 2019 only to lose a likely win owing to a problem with his energy recovery unit.</p> \n<p>For F1, then, a sigh of relief at the top that their grand gamble on the new regulations has at least not delivered the feared utter dominance of a single team. Instead there is the promise of a competition only becoming more fierce, a gauntlet laid down by Ferrari, challenge accepted by Red Bull, with Mercedes working furiously to join the fray.</p> \n<p>On Saturday the FIA also published their enquiry into the controversial finale to the 2021 Formula One season in Abu Dhabi. They have concluded that the decisions made by the Race Director, Michael Masi, which ultimately denied Hamilton the championship were made in \u201cgood faith\u201d but that \u201chuman error\u201d played a part.</p> \n<p>They also confirmed the result of the race, which Verstappen won to claim the title, stands, and that the governing body now considers the matter closed .</p> \n<p>There was no apology to Hamilton, who accepted that he had not expected the FIA to acknowledge their culpability. \u201cLook, I wasn\u2019t expecting an apology and it is not something I have focused on,\u201d he said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/17/formula-one-2022-team-by-team-guide-cars-drivers\">Formula One 2022: a team-by-team guide to the cars and drivers</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cWe know that is the way it is, and that was probably not going to happen. But at least there is that transparency, and it has been called a human error and that is a positive step.\u201d</p> \n<p>The report is unlikely to satisfy many deeply unhappy about the way the race was handled. Masi has since been removed from his post and it acknowledged he had been operating under immense pressure.

      "bodyText": "Formula One had been optimistic for a reinvigorated fight at the front in its new era of cars and on the form of qualifying for the season-opener in Bahrain, they can be satisfied their plans have delivered the goods in this opening foray. With Charles Leclerc and Ferrari claiming a thrilling pole position in front of reigning champion Max Verstappen, qualifying heralded a potential dog fight this season between three manufacturers at the front of the field. A scrap most notable for it being Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes in the unusual position of playing catch-up to their rivals Red Bull and the resurgent Ferrari. The Scuderia are delivering on their pre-season promise with Carlos Sainz also claiming third place. For the sport\u2019s previously dominant team, qualifying was a sobering experience. Mercedes are floundering and there is no quick fix in sight. For eight consecutive years the constructors\u2019 champions, this is the hardest start they have endured since 2013. Hamilton was in fifth place, a full six-tenths down on Leclerc, with his teammate George Russell in ninth. Hamilton, the seven-time world champion, pulled no punches in his assessment. \u201cThose guys ahead of us are in another league,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m generally really happy today. Given how we\u2019ve been the last few weeks and the problems we\u2019ve had with the car, it\u2019s a bit of a nightmare to drive.\u201d Nor did he expect any great turnaround in race pace. \u201cThose guys will be going away,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not in the fight with those guys. My battle is with the guys behind most likely.\u201d The problems facing Mercedes will not be solved overnight. Their car is suffering from what is known as porpoising, bouncing induced by a break in downforce on straights. If Hamilton is to earn an eighth title he will have to do it the hard way. For Ferrari, who have not challenged toward the front since 2019, having completely shifted their focus last year to the 2022 model built to the all-new regulations, their plan has paid off in spades. Red Bull are right on their tail, however, and on another day Verstappen, who was a tenth back, might have had the edge. A nip and tuck fight between the two teams can be expected in the race on Sunday. Leclerc and Verstappen, both elbows-out drivers, are likely to be uncompromising with one another into turn one. On the first truly competitive run for these brand new cars, unleashed on low fuel and with their engines turned up, Leclerc held a slender advantage. For the final decisive laps in Q3 he was hooked up and put in an almighty lap with a time of 1min 30.558sec. Much as Verstappen attacked he could not match it,. A jubilant Leclerc revelled in what he had felt was the real potential of his car but noted ominously that he felt there was more to come. It is Leclerc\u2019s 10th pole position and Ferrari\u2019s first since he took the top spot in Baku last year. The Mon\u00e9gasque driver is in every position to try to convert it with good form at the Bahrain International Circuit. He took pole here and was conformably leading in 2019 only to lose a likely win owing to a problem with his energy recovery unit. For F1, then, a sigh of relief at the top that their grand gamble on the new regulations has at least not delivered the feared utter dominance of a single team. Instead there is the promise of a competition only becoming more fierce, a gauntlet laid down by Ferrari, challenge accepted by Red Bull, with Mercedes working furiously to join the fray. On Saturday the FIA also published their enquiry into the controversial finale to the 2021 Formula One season in Abu Dhabi. They have concluded that the decisions made by the Race Director, Michael Masi, which ultimately denied Hamilton the championship were made in \u201cgood faith\u201d but that \u201chuman error\u201d played a part. They also confirmed the result of the race, which Verstappen won to claim the title, stands, and that the governing body now considers the matter closed . There was no apology to Hamilton, who accepted that he had not expected the FIA to acknowledge their culpability. \u201cLook, I wasn\u2019t expecting an apology and it is not something I have focused on,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that is the way it is, and that was probably not going to happen. But at least there is that transparency, and it has been called a human error and that is a positive step.\u201d The report is unlikely to satisfy many deeply unhappy about the way the race was handled. Masi has since been removed from his post and it acknowledged he had been operating under immense pressure. It cited human error in the decision regarding unlapped cars, although it appeared the call was a conscious decision made by Masi and that the rules regarding when the safety car should have been brought in were open to \u201cinterpretation\u201d. Sergio P\u00e9rez was in fourth for Red Bull with Valtteri Bottas in sixth for Alfa Romeo. Kevin Magnussen back with Haas was an impressive seventh, with Fernando Alonso in eighth for Alpine. Pierre Gasly was in 10th for AlphaTauri. Esteban Ocon was in 11th for Alpine and Mick Schumacher in 12th for Haas. Lando Norris was 13th for McLaren while Alex Albon made a good return to F1 with Williams, finishing in 14th place. Guanyu Zhou, the first Chinese driver in F1, was in 14th for Alfa Romeo. Yuki Tsunoda went out in 16th for AlphaTauri, with the two Aston Martins of Nico H\u00fclkenberg and Lance Stroll in 17th and 19th. Daniel Ricciardo was a disappointing 18th for McLaren and Nicholas Latifi was 20th for Williams.",

      "bodyText": "Two weeks ago, Alani Iyanuoluwa fled Kyiv as the Russian invasion intensified. Making her way across Europe, the 24-year-old hoped to be reunited with family in London. Yet for 10 days she has been stranded in a French port \u2013 because she is Nigerian. Iyanuoluwa is among a growing number of refugees who claim the British government is ignoring black people who fled Ukraine. Their experiences have again raised the issue of race and the UK\u2019s welcome to refugees, prompting claims that ministers would never have unveiled last week\u2019s humanitarian sponsorship scheme for Ukrainians had it not been aimed at white Europeans. Critics say that while Michael Gove\u2019s scheme places no limit on numbers, it contrasts sharply with the government\u2019s visa scheme for Afghans, which promised spaces for just 5,000 people in the first year. When the scheme finally opened in January, it emerged that most of those spots would be taken by Afghans already living in Britain. A previous sponsorship scheme, launched in 2015 and largely for Syrian refugees, has been hampered by bureaucracy, managing about 700 placements in seven years compared with Gove\u2019s promise of \u201ctens of thousands\u201d for Ukrainians. Alba Kapoor, senior policy manager at the Runnymede Trust, said the UK\u2019s response to the Ukrainian crisis had thrown up questions of parity amid claims that black people fleeing the conflict tended to be \u201cdehumanised\u201d and viewed as African migrants rather than Ukrainian refugees. \u201cThere\u2019s an obvious question, which is why people of colour who are fleeing war and terror and persecution do not have the right to equal treatment to others,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are still confronted by an inability to properly conceive people from the global south as humans if they are trying to flee war and persecution. That\u2019s a sad place to be \u2013 it\u2019s not just the government, but also the press.\u201d Kapoor said no Alan Kurdi moment \u2013 the Syrian boy photographed lying dead on a Turkish beach in 2015 \u2013 had been needed to galvanise support for refugees fleeing the fighting. Jabeer Butt, chief executive of the Race Equality Foundation, said: \u201cDevastatingly, race has undoubtedly been an issue in the level of support provided by the UK government for refugees from Ukraine compared with those from Afghanistan and other places that have faced terrible conflict in recent years.\u201d The government\u2019s preoccupation with viewing refugees on the basis of where they came from needed to be re-examined. \u201cWe cannot blindly accept a tiered system whereby people\u2019s needs are prioritised based on nationality. This feels like being asked by the government to accept that in Britain we value the lives of people with a certain skin colour over others,\u201d he said. Iyanuoluwa is staying with two other Nigerian students in Boulogne-sur-Mer. All three fear returning to Nigeria because of the dangers of kidnapping and trafficking, but say that as non-Ukrainian nationals they are not eligible for the British schemes, despite two of them having family in the UK. \u201cWe\u2019re coming from war and they are telling us that without a Ukrainian passport we can\u2019t come to the UK, but the UK should consider all residents living in Ukraine when the war started,\u201d she said. Iyanuoluwa is among a large group identified by charities that appears to have been split up from other Ukrainians by authorities because they are black. They include Kevin Kanjuru, from Kenya, who was studying computer science in Kyiv when Russia invaded and has family in Britain \u2013 an uncle in Northampton with UK citizenship who is also a local councillor. They also include Nigerian Michael Uwandu who lived in Ukraine for 12 years but who was separated from his nine-year-old daughter and Ukrainian ex partner who fled before him and has lost contact with them. The 37-year-old was granted Ukrainian citizenship in late February but had to leave before collecting his passport. Uwandu should be eligible for Gove\u2019s scheme but the lack of proof of citizenship appears to have hampered his application and he has a sister, a British national, and cousin in the UK he is trying to join. Others seemingly stranded include an Afghan refugee who had refugee status in Ukraine, but is not eligible for the sponsorship scheme \u2013 despite a UK national offering to sponsor her. Clare Moseley, founder of the charity Care4Calais, said: \u201cThe UK schemes to help Ukrainian refugees come to Britain are heavily biased towards Ukrainian nationals. But they are not the only people whose homes and lives have been destroyed by the conflict.\u201d The government\u2019s nationalities and borders bill, which is to return to the House of Commons in the coming weeks, intends to criminalise anyone arriving in the UK without permission, as all asylum seekers do. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities rejected the claims as \u201cutterly baseless.\u201d A spokesperson said: \u201cWe are working as fast as possible to house refugees from across the world and are proud this country has provided homes for more than 4,000 Afghans evacuees in such a short space of time. \u201cThe \u00a310,500 provided to councils to support each [Ukranian] arrival is the same level of funding as under the Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme and we urge councils to join those who have pledged to support Afghan families, and those who can offer more housing places, to do so. \u201cThe scheme is open to Ukrainian nationals who were residents in Ukraine prior to 1 January 2022, regardless of ethnicity, and also to their immediate family members who may be of other nationalities.\u201d",

Long and complex passwords are more secure but difficult to remember, leaving many people using weak and easy-to-guess credentials. One study by the UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) revealed how millions are using <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-47974583\">their pet\u2019s name, football team names, \u2018password\u2019 and \u201c123456\u201d</a> to access online services.</p> <p>But this leaves you wide open to attack: cybercriminals can crack weak passwords in seconds using automated tools. \u201cA hacker needs roughly two seconds to crack an 11-character password made up of numbers,\u201d says Alex Balan, director of security research at security company Bitdefender. If the password is more complex, containing numbers, symbols and uppercase and lowercase letters, the time needed to break it jumps to 400 years.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It might seem daunting at first, but a password manager will make your life a lot easier</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Experts say a good password should be unique and contain a combination of letters, numbers and special characters. The key to a strong one is length, says <a href=\"https://blog.sean-wright.com/\">independent security researcher Sean Wright</a>. \u201cWhile password complexity does help, the length matters far more.\u201d Experts <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/how-long-should-my-passwords-be/\">recommend</a> a minimum of 11 characters, more if possible.</p> <p>The typical internet user has about <a href=\"https://tech.co/password-managers/how-many-passwords-average-person\">100 sets of login details</a> \u2013 memorising this number of complex passwords is well beyond most people\u2019s powers of recall.</p> <p>Password manager apps can resolve this problem by creating long and complex credentials for you, and remembering them the next time you log in. Yet <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/forecasts/985146/using-password-managers-in-the-uk\">only about one in five people in the UK use one</a>, according to recent estimates.</p> <p>Many people are put off by the hassle, while others are suspicious about allowing one company to store all of their passwords. How do you know which one is trustworthy, and what if the company is hacked?</p> <p>It might seem daunting at first, but a password manager will make your life a lot easier. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.</p> <h2><strong>Why you should join the 20% who use one</strong></h2> <p>Once you\u2019ve downloaded a password manager, such as 1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden or Dashlane, you can follow the instructions to import your logins from somewhere else such as your browser. You can also start from scratch if you want, and delete accounts you don\u2019t need any more as you go along.</p> <p>After setting it up, the app can generate strong passwords for you for any new sites you use, and these will autofill as you browse. This solves one of the toughest aspects of password security: remembering lots of complex credentials.</p> <p>\u201cSince password managers take care of the remembering part, every password can be a long, totally random selection of characters,\u201d says Jake Moore, global cybersecurity adviser at security firm ESET.</p> <p>Password managers also ensure you use a unique login for each account, rather than repeating them across services. This is crucial for preventing \u201c<a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Credential_stuffing\">credential-stuffing</a>\u201d attacks, which happen when a hacker uses your compromised password, for example from Facebook, to try to get into other well-known services you might use such as Netflix or Spotify.</p> <p>Another often overlooked benefit is that most password managers help prevent phishing attacks, where scammers will encourage you to click a link so they can steal your credentials. \u201cSince they tie the credentials to a specific web address, the autocomplete will not work on phishing sites,\u201d says <a href=\"https://blog.sean-wright.com/\"> </a>Wright.</p> <p>In some cases you can even use password managers to securely share a login with other trusted people, such as family members. They also allow you to store pin codes, credit card details and online banking credentials securely.</p> <h2><strong>Why they are trustworthy and not as much hassle as you think</strong></h2> <p>One major misconception about password managers is that having your credentials stored in one place is a risk. \u201cI am often asked: \u2018What if someone is able to access my password manager?\u2019, but using one is far better than reusing the same credentials for all accounts,\u201d Moore says.</p> <p>While there is a small risk in placing all your logins in one place, the likelihood of the password manager being breached is extremely low, says Wright.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>While they\u2019re sometimes mocked, physical password books aren\u2019t a bad idea</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Password managers keep your details secure by encrypting your logins so they can only be accessed when you enter the master password. \u201cYour plain text passwords are never stored on your device or on the password manager\u2019s servers,\u201d says Paul Bischoff, privacy advocate at Comparitech.</p> <p>Setting up a password manager is probably the biggest hurdle for those diving in, but you can do it gradually, changing passwords as you go. Once you have set up your app, it\u2019ll save you the time you spend now resetting logins you\u2019ve forgotten.</p> <p>Some see cost as an issue, but password managers are often free, or available for a few pounds a month. If you do decide to pay, the subscription will be worth it if you consider the costs of being hacked and details such as bank accounts being accessed.</p> <h2><strong>Are </strong><strong>Apple Keychain and Google </strong><strong>Password Manager </strong><strong>as good as independent password managers?</strong></h2> <p>Apple Keychain and the Google Chrome Password Manager are password managers, but they lack the features of \u201cfull-service\u201d ones. Sticking with Apple or Google means you can\u2019t easily use your password manager with other devices or browsers.</p> <p>Apple Keychain and Google Chrome help strengthen protection, but you will struggle to easily move across devices without an independent password manager, says Moore. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s better than reusing passwords, a third-party password manager usually offers more features and can be easily accessed across devices.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Steps to improve your security</strong></h2> <p>Keep in mind that the password manager will need a master password, which you\u2019ll need to be able to remember.

While they\u2019re sometimes mocked, physical password books aren\u2019t a bad idea, as long as you follow the guidelines in creating strong, unique logins, and the book is kept somewhere secure and doesn\u2019t leave the house.

The overall message is: nothing much is going on.\u201d</p> <p>Something definitely <em>is</em> going on, of course, and it\u2019s possible (if you\u2019re not in Russia) to feel overwhelmed by the relentless news of destruction and killing.

Klein, a US political journalist, has been hosting this podcast since 2015; it was co-opted by the <em>New York Times</em> at the start of 2021. Klein is a very good interviewer, because he\u2019s so well-informed and thoughtful and usually the twice-weekly show covers a variety of topics, such as Covid, the climate crisis, kindness, cryptocurrencies.

Klein asked whether Putin believes what he says in public and Gessen used the way that teenagers argue as an illustrative example: how a teen can tell a lie and then, when you challenge them, absolutely deny it \u201cand the longer the argument goes on, the more attached they will be to the thing they lied to you about, even though you both know that they were lying\u201d. I\u2019ve just started the latest episode, which features the heavyweight historian Timothy Snyder and it\u2019s impressive too, as was the episode before the Gessen one, where Klein discussed Putin\u2019s motivations with Fiona Hill, the co-author of a Putin biography. Be warned, though, that that one\u2019s pretty depressing (\u201cHe\u2019s going to double and triple down on the military side of things,\u201d said Hill).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s the shows that feature real-life Ukrainians living through this real-life hell that stick with you</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s interesting, when you search out podcasts about the war, that so many talk about Putin. All the learned information about his history and motivations seems worldly wise when you\u2019re discussing the situation from New York or London.

      "body": "<p>Writing for Observer Food Monthly has brought me lots of excitement down the years, most recently an offer of more salty liquorice than might be strictly advisable. But the adventure of which I still think most often, and most fondly, also delivered a good friend to me \u2013 \u201ca dear pal\u201d, as he would put it \u2013 in the form of the great cook <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/apr/18/my-secret-ingredient-colatura-di-alici-jeremy-lee\">Jeremy Lee</a>, with whom I first bonded halfway up a mountain in Scotland in 2004. I won\u2019t bore you with the details now (they involve an elusive stag, an enveloping mist, and a certain physical feebleness on both our parts). All I can say is that I had then never been so glad to share a Tunnock\u2019s Caramel Wafer with another human being. Eat your heart out, John Buchan.</p> <p>Jeremy is the chef at <a href=\"https://www.quovadissoho.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Quo Vadis</a> in Soho, London, and earlier this month the 10th anniversary of his arrival at that magnificent establishment was marked with a swanky dinner for friends and colleagues. It was an overwhelmingly lovely night. House cocktails were served, as pink and ineffably chic as ever, and then we feasted on some of the things, simple but marvellously good, I will always associate with his restaurant: smoked eel on toast, roast pork with mashed potato, meringues as big as the hill on which I first got to know him. All night, Jeremy moved from room to room in his trademark French-style worker\u2019s jacket: a smiling, kindly presence. For a few impossible hours, I enjoyed the illusion that all was right with the world.</p> <p>Afterwards, lying tipsily in bed, I thought about Quo Vadis: how much I love it; how much I would miss it if, God forbid, it ever disappeared. (I only came to understand fully what a taste-free fool Liz Truss truly must be when I read that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/02/liz-truss-hosted-3k-lunch-for-us-envoy-over-civil-service-objections\" title=\"\">she had refused to host a US trade representative there</a>, choosing instead to take him to some vastly more expensive private members\u2019 club for dinner.)</p> <p>I thought, too, of some other favourite long-standing London restaurants: Moro, in Clerkenwell, which is 25; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/sep/15/gospel-of-st-john-a-restaurant-should-be-an-old-friend-fergus-henderson-trevor-gulliver\" title=\"\">St John</a>, down the road, which must be approaching 30. My mind spinning on (too much \u2013 or too little \u2013 wine), I tried to picture the <a href=\"https://theoldvicarage.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Old Vicarage</a>, in Ridgeway in Derbyshire, where I celebrated getting a place at university with my dad, and <a href=\"http://www.ashoka1967.com/\" title=\"\">Ashoka</a>, which claims to be Sheffield\u2019s oldest Indian restaurant.</p> <p>There will always be fashionable, blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it restaurants, and people will always rush to eat in them. But it\u2019s the ones that last that take up residence in our hearts. All the things that can happen in one place, good and bad. The drama! At Quo Vadis, I was sitting next to Sam Clark, the co-owner of Moro, and as I told him \u2013 poor man, me droning on \u2013 so much has happened to me there, not just birthdays and the occasional career triumph. It was at Moro that a man who claimed to be in love with me left the table to go and ring his girlfriend, an experience that, at the time, I found more humiliating than I can possibly say. (It gets worse: when he returned, approximately 8 minutes and 47 seconds later, he had the temerity to be annoyed by my sudden loss of appetite, as if it was <em>me</em> who was spoiling the fun.) What I find is that the bad stuff doesn\u2019t change how fondly you feel about somewhere. A beloved restaurant is a bit like home in that sense: safe, steady, restorative. If it solemnises the highs, it absorbs the lows, too. You go back, you order your favourite dish \u2013 cardamom and rosewater ice-cream, in the case of Moro \u2013 and the sadness is soon rubbed out.</p> <p>It may be hard, sometimes, no longer to be the cool place; to watch your best customers growing older. But in the end, what you have is far, far more valuable: relationships that may be traced back many years; deep affection, even love, on the part of your regulars. Eventually, you pass into the kitchen equivalent of elder statesman territory. You have authority, and all the beautiful calm that comes with it \u2013 and of course people have children, and godchildren, and nieces and nephews. A new generation arrives, (re)discoveries are made. The circle is complete, and begins to turn again. All this was in my mind as I tried to sleep \u2013 this, and the sense that I had surely eaten one too many spoonfuls of meringue. <br></p>",

I won\u2019t bore you with the details now (they involve an elusive stag, an enveloping mist, and a certain physical feebleness on both our parts). All I can say is that I had then never been so glad to share a Tunnock\u2019s Caramel Wafer with another human being. Eat your heart out, John Buchan. Jeremy is the chef at Quo Vadis in Soho, London, and earlier this month the 10th anniversary of his arrival at that magnificent establishment was marked with a swanky dinner for friends and colleagues. It was an overwhelmingly lovely night. House cocktails were served, as pink and ineffably chic as ever, and then we feasted on some of the things, simple but marvellously good, I will always associate with his restaurant: smoked eel on toast, roast pork with mashed potato, meringues as big as the hill on which I first got to know him. All night, Jeremy moved from room to room in his trademark French-style worker\u2019s jacket: a smiling, kindly presence. For a few impossible hours, I enjoyed the illusion that all was right with the world. Afterwards, lying tipsily in bed, I thought about Quo Vadis: how much I love it; how much I would miss it if, God forbid, it ever disappeared. (I only came to understand fully what a taste-free fool Liz Truss truly must be when I read that she had refused to host a US trade representative there, choosing instead to take him to some vastly more expensive private members\u2019 club for dinner.) I thought, too, of some other favourite long-standing London restaurants: Moro, in Clerkenwell, which is 25; St John, down the road, which must be approaching 30. My mind spinning on (too much \u2013 or too little \u2013 wine), I tried to picture the Old Vicarage, in Ridgeway in Derbyshire, where I celebrated getting a place at university with my dad, and Ashoka, which claims to be Sheffield\u2019s oldest Indian restaurant. There will always be fashionable, blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it restaurants, and people will always rush to eat in them. But it\u2019s the ones that last that take up residence in our hearts. All the things that can happen in one place, good and bad. The drama! At Quo Vadis, I was sitting next to Sam Clark, the co-owner of Moro, and as I told him \u2013 poor man, me droning on \u2013 so much has happened to me there, not just birthdays and the occasional career triumph. It was at Moro that a man who claimed to be in love with me left the table to go and ring his girlfriend, an experience that, at the time, I found more humiliating than I can possibly say. (It gets worse: when he returned, approximately 8 minutes and 47 seconds later, he had the temerity to be annoyed by my sudden loss of appetite, as if it was me who was spoiling the fun.) What I find is that the bad stuff doesn\u2019t change how fondly you feel about somewhere. A beloved restaurant is a bit like home in that sense: safe, steady, restorative. If it solemnises the highs, it absorbs the lows, too. You go back, you order your favourite dish \u2013 cardamom and rosewater ice-cream, in the case of Moro \u2013 and the sadness is soon rubbed out. It may be hard, sometimes, no longer to be the cool place; to watch your best customers growing older. But in the end, what you have is far, far more valuable: relationships that may be traced back many years; deep affection, even love, on the part of your regulars. Eventually, you pass into the kitchen equivalent of elder statesman territory. You have authority, and all the beautiful calm that comes with it \u2013 and of course people have children, and godchildren, and nieces and nephews. A new generation arrives, (re)discoveries are made. The circle is complete, and begins to turn again. All this was in my mind as I tried to sleep \u2013 this, and the sense that I had surely eaten one too many spoonfuls of meringue.",

That said, the narrow losses may hurt more \u2013 particularly last time out, when they disrupted France\u2019s rhythm but could not land the killer blow. Today offers the chance to find some attacking fluency and end with a flourish against Italy, already assured of their seventh wooden spoon in succession.</p> <p>Wales could still scrape into third place with a bonus-point victory, if other results go their way. Win well today, and their 2022 campaign will go into the history books as a tough job well done. Another close-run thing might change that narrative, though, and if they were to do the unthinkable and lose, all that hard work will have been for nothing. The trophy will be won elsewhere, but the stakes are still high.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Time to sign off with Daniel Gallan\u2019s match report from the Principality Stadium. Thanks for joining me, that was quite something. For now though, it\u2019s arrivederci. It will be interesting to see where both teams go after this unforgettable afternoon. Italy have answered those persistent questions over whether they belong in the Six Nations, and with emerging stars in the team and at under-20 level, the next target will be to hand some other side the wooden spoon next year. As of right now, the most likely candidates are Wales, who will finish fifth, one year after winning the title. This is a dark day for them, completing a spectacular fall from grace \u2013 but perhaps having a point to prove and pride to recover will work for them in the long run, after a curiously flat campaign. Daniel Gallan was our man at the Principality; his match report will be here soon. You can also follow Ireland v Scotland here, with Lee Calvert. Josh Adams was awarded man of the match, for saving one try and then scoring what looked to be the winner. But after Ange Capuozzo\u2019s moment of magic, Adams gave his man-of-the-match medal to the Italian full-back. A lovely moment, and an incredible show of sportsmanship. And now the Italy coach, Kieran Crowley: \u201cI\u2019m just really proud. They were out on their feet the last 30 minutes but they kept playing, kept believing. There was a tear in my eye in the stands ... you\u2019d think we had won the World Cup but this is so important, they\u2019re a young group and they need moments like this. One game doesn\u2019t make a team, we\u2019ve got to build on this when we meet up the summer and build up to November.\u201d Wayne Pivac speaks: \u201cDiscipline wasn\u2019t great in the first half, we conceded 12 points from ill-discipline ... and then to get back in the game, and throw it away at the end, it\u2019s hugely frustrating. The Italians came here with more enthusiasm than us, which is hard to understand. We\u2019re very disappointed. We had improved throughout the competition and today we\u2019ve let ourselves down.\u201d You can sign up for our weekly rugby union newsletter, The Breakdown, here: Here\u2019s what Dan Biggar has to say after his 100th Wales cap ends in a shock defeat \u2013 and it\u2019s not good. \u201cSimply not good enough,\u201d he says. \u201cWe haven\u2019t played well, but to not finish it off, when they\u2019re 70m from their own line. It\u2019s probably the last chance for some of those players. I think we were unlucky on the [disallowed] try, but it wasn\u2019t given, so there we go. \u201cToo many boys not up to speed, we were second to loose balls, balls in the air \u2013 anything that required talent or work ethic, we came up short.\u201d Here is the Italy captain, Michele Lamaro: \u201cI just want to celebrate with my family, celebrate this moment. This is the first step of a long process we\u2019ve started \u2013 Capuozzo is the super star of our squad, that try was incredible ... [but] we couldn\u2019t celebrate that if we weren\u2019t close and hadn\u2019t conceded. \u201cBeing in the moment until the end, stay concentrating, was key to us winning.\u201d How will they celebrate tonight? \u201cWe will not celebrate,\u201d he smirks. \u201cDefinitely not.\u201d Mine\u2019s a Peroni. More on the match-winning try \u2013 Padovani collected a high kick and swung the ball to Capuozzo in midfield. The full-back skipped to the right, burst between Adams and Faletau and left another red shirt on the deck with a body-swerve. Suddenly free down the right wing, but with Dan Biggar covering, he looked up and offloaded to Padovani, who went over under the posts. A try worthy of winning any game. Wow. It\u2019s hard to know what to say after that finale \u2013 but the numbers tell a story. This is Italy\u2019s first win on Welsh soil, ever \u2013 and ends their 36-game Six Nations losing streak. It\u2019s historic \u2013 and honestly, it\u2019s deserved. The clock ticks to 80.01, Paolo Garbisi converts from under the posts \u2013 and that\u2019s it! Italy have won!!! The players collapse into a collective heap, cheering and crying. What a moment! Oh my days! Is this actually happening? A moment of absolute brilliance from Ange Capuozzo, from nowhere, sets up Edoardo Padovani to score \u2013 and if Garbisi can convert, Italy will lead with seconds to go ... 78 mins: Adams had just been awarded man-of-the-match, but escapes embarrassment as Rowlands tips the lineout away ... 76 mins: Wales want a fourth try, and a shot at finishing third in the table \u2013 but a penalty against Josh Adams for dissent allows Italy to advance downfield. 75 mins: Bradley Roberts is on for try-scorer Dewi Lake. The Ulster prop\u2019s lid is something to behold \u2013 a ginger mullet that almost looks ... permed? It\u2019s breathtaking. 73 mins: Wales produce another push downfield through Nick Tompkins, one of a number of replacements who has made a big difference in the second half. Italy\u2019s bench is now emptied, with David Sisi on for Pettinelli. 72 mins: The red wave pours forward again and under the posts, Wyn Jones belly-flops over the line with support from Faletau. Braam Steyn had his arm underneath the ball, and no try is awarded \u2013 the TMO confirms the on-field decision. 71 mins: Suddenly, Italy need a converted try to retake the lead, and Wales can sense a bonus-point victory against tiring opponents. Moriarty wins a penalty in midfield to roars from the home crowd, and Wales will push on again. Cherif Traore is on for Italy, replacing the excellent Fischetti. Wales edge upfield, with replacements Brown and Moriarty key in forcing some forward momentum. The ball is worked to Adams on the left flank \u2013 he darts infield, beats a weary challenge from Pettinelli and sprints for the line. Brilliant work from the wing, and Wales may have got out of jail here. But now Wales have found the gap, and Josh Adams, the man who denied Ioane a try with a brilliant tackle, who scores \u2013 and Biggar adds the conversion. 66 mins: Kieran Hardy, who I thought was impressive off the bench against France, is on at scrum-half for Gareth Davies. Biggar offloads to Rees-Zammit, who gets swallowed up by the blue wall. Wales must feel like they\u2019re playing France again ... This is still my gut feeling, but every change, penalty, Welsh handling error sends more seconds tumbling off the clock ... 63 mins: The Italy No 8, Toa Halahifi, is replaced by Braam Steyn, who is earning his 50th cap. Wales get away with a spilled high ball, and there\u2019s a bit of a kicking duel. Fusco claims a high ball easily \u2013 the Italy backs have looked comfortable with those all day. Missed penalty! Wales 14-15 Italy Frustratingly for Padovani, his kick has plenty of distance \u2013 but not the accuracy, drifting well wide. 61 mins: Wyn Jones is also on in the front row, and Wales\u2019 reshuffled pack gets in a mess, whistled for offside near the halfway line. It\u2019s 53m from goal, and Padovani is going to have a go ... 60 mins: Dan Biggar knocks on from an awkward pass as Alun Wyn Jones is replaced. He gets a huge ovation, but this isn\u2019t how he\u2019d want to exit the game, a point down to Italy at home. Will Rowlands replaces him, while Callum Sheedy is on for McNicholl. Italy bring on Alessandro Fusco at scrum-half, replacing Callum Braley \u2013 so the total Callum count holds steady at one. 59 mins: Italy have been really disciplined and organised today, the usual set-piece errors far less frequent today. They\u2019ve also missed nine tackles, out of 125 attempted today. An easy three points for Paolo Garbisi and Italy have edged back in front with just over 20 minutes to play. 55 mins: What a passage of play this is from Italy. Capuozzo is under huge pressure after collecting a kick behind the try-line, but he finds Ioane, who gallops away downfield. Italy kick and chase, Faletau is back to smother it \u2013 but he\u2019s penalised for sealing off, and Italy can retake the lead here ... Italy change two of their front row after being outgunned in the maul \u2013 Luca Bigi and Filippo Alongi replace Nicotera and Ceccarelli. Marco Zanon is also on, replacing centre Leonardo Marin. Wales win the lineout and try brute force one more time, Dewi Lake keeping the ball at the back of the maul, then darting for the line for a couple of metres out. And he gets there, to score his first try for Wales! Biggar\u2019s conversion hits the post, but goes over, and Wales retake the lead. 49 mins: Biggar is OK to continue, while Ross Moriarty has come on for Seb Davies as Wales look to bolster their pack. From the scrum, Fischetti is penalised \u2013 but Wales keep going for the line, Biggar kicking for touch rather than the posts ... 48 mins: Wales win the lineout but are held up again, and Dan Biggar is left crumpled in a heap after a tackle by Garbisi. Play is stopped for the captain to receive treatment. 47 mins: A Wales penalty, Marco Fuser offside, and Biggar kicks for the corner. Italy bring on Niccolo Cannone in place of Fuser in the second row. Wales lineout ... 46 mins: Nick Tompkins is on, replacing Uilisi Halaholo at centre. Wales really are fortunate to only be five points behind at this stage \u2013 their benches may be key in turning the match back in their favour. 45 mins: Italy turn it over and launch a counter attack, with danger man Ioane chipping through and collecting his own kick. Italy are two-on-one, and Ioane goes for the corner \u2013 but Josh Adams produces a superb, try-stopping tackle! 42 mins: Smart work by Navidi at the breakdown to win a penalty, which Biggar kicks downfield. Wales work through the phases but they\u2019re going backwards; Biggar launches the up-and-under, which Capuozzo collects under pressure from Rees-Zammit. 41 mins: Garbisi misjudges his kick \u2013 a rare error from the Italy fly-half \u2013 and Wales win the lineout. One change for Wales, with prop Dillon Lewis replaced by Leon Brown. Some half-time reading before Le Crunch in Paris later tonight: Italy lead by five at the half, but Wales may be relieved it isn\u2019t more after that late surge for the line. More soon ... 42 mins: Will Italy take the three points, or take the scrum? No, Garbisi taps out for a lineout \u2013 and they win the ball. Admirable aggression, but can they get over the line? No, it\u2019s a Welsh penalty \u2013 and half time. 40 mins: We\u2019re into the red, with Italy gaining a penalty advantage and Garbisi kicking out wide to Ioane. McNicholl beats him in the air, but spills behind the line, Rees-Zammit gets a hand to it ahead of Capuozzo \u2013 and Owen Watkin just grounds it before Braley can pounce. Wales are living very dangerously here \u2013 but Italy will go back for the penalty. 39 mins: A terrific break from Monty Ioane, barrelling through McNicholl and galloping clear \u2013 but he\u2019s held up and Italy don\u2019t have the numbers to force their way over the line. The ball goes out, and Italy have a scrum, 5m out ... 37 mins: Italy clear their lines, and Wales must build from the back \u2013 but Rees-Zammit is swamped by blue shirts, and soon after, the ball pops from Adam Beard\u2019s grasp, and Italy turn it over. Brex\u2019s kick downfield is gathered by Josh Adams, but Italy are standing firm here. 35 mins: Italy may have found a strategy to try and win this game without ever carrying the ball deep into Welsh territory. They manage to stall Wales in midfield again, with Biggar kicking diagonally to touch. And here\u2019s another Wales error, admittedly forced by fine work from Giacomo Nicotera at the breakdown. Padovani lines it up from 48 metres ... and nails it! An immediate response from the visitors, Garbisi getting off the floor to kick from distance after Wales are penalised. Too many errors from Wayne Pivac\u2019s side ... Italy struggle to keep pace as Wales work through the phases. Faletau offloads to Owen Watkin, who finds a gap in the blue wall, sidesteps the last man, and ends the try drought! Biggar adds the extras from an angle. 25 mins: There\u2019s a roar of anticipation as Rees-Zammit skips down the touchline, but Lamaro does well to get across and haul him down. Wales build down the opposite side, Adams darting forward and getting the hosts inside the 22 ... 23 mins: The positive for Wales is that they\u2019ve piled on the pressure since going 6-0 down; the negative is they appear to have forgotten how to score tries. Plenty of time, though. 21 mins: Rees-Zammit looks the most likely, and he cuts through Italy for the first time with a burst toward the corner. He is just about held up, and the ball worked right towards Halaholo \u2013 but again, it\u2019s spilled. Wales at least have a penalty ... but from the quick take, they knock on, and Italy survive! 19 mins: Wales try a carbon-copy move, but this time McNicholl\u2019s pass wide to Rees-Zammit is poor, the wing just unable to hold on and knocking it forward with the line in sight. 18 mins: Penalty advantage Wales in the maul, and the ball is swept out wide \u2013 but too quickly for McNicholl, whose tip on to Rees-Zammit is forward ... 17 mins: Wales immediately earn a penalty. Biggar kicks to the corner, Wales win the lineout this time and drive for the line. Italy stall them, but Fischetti goes in off his feet, and Wales will go again ... Penalty! Wales 0-6 Italy (Padovani) He slots it from close to the halfway line, and Italy extend their early lead. 15 mins: It\u2019s another Italian penalty, with Seb Davies getting isolated. It\u2019s a long-range effort, with Edoardo Padovani lining it up ... Penalty! Wales 0-3 Italy (Garbisi) The fly-half kicks the three points, and Italy lead! 12 mins: Italy come again, Juan Ignacio Brex finding a gap after a dummy pass towards Garbisi \u2013 and Wales concede the penalty ... 10 mins: The Welsh lineout is overthrown, and Paolo Garbisi can kick away. It\u2019s returned by McNicholl, who then has to scurry across to the left and collect another awkwardly bobbling ball downfield, just beyond the try-line. Back to square one. 8 mins: Italy get their first chance to push into the Wales half \u2013 but Capuozzo is quickly penalised for not releasing, and Biggar can kick towards the corner ... 6 mins: Wales run aground in midfield, and Dan Biggar sends a spiralling box kick high into the air \u2013 but the move fizzles out after a red shirt is offside. 4 mins: A couple of hopeful high kicks are dealt with comfortably by the Welsh backs, allowing the hosts to build some early pressure ... 2 mins: An awkward early moment for full-back McNicholl, caught out by the bounce from a kick downfield. He collects at the second attempt, but gets floored by Monty Ioane for his trouble. Even in bright sunshine on a Saturday afternoon, the Welsh anthem almost takes the roof off. It\u2019s game time; Dan Biggar kicks off. The players stand together in solidarity against racism, and in support of the people of Ukraine, to warm applause from around the ground. Time for the anthems ... Dan Biggar leads the hosts out as captain, earning his 100th cap today. He\u2019s followed by Alun Wyn Jones, who brings his two young daughters out on to the pitch with him. He is winning a historic 150th cap \u2013 between them, the two men have more caps than the entire Italy side put together. This is the first part of a Saturday triple-header, with Ireland v Scotland at 4.45pm and then France v England at 8pm. Here\u2019s some essential afternoon reading: The return of Louis Rees-Zammit to Wayne Pivac\u2019s starting XV could be key to Welsh hopes of racking up points today. After a breakthrough campaign and Lions squad call-up last year, it\u2019s been a tough tournament for the flying Gloucester wing, but teammate Josh Adams is among those expecting a big impact today. The big news for Wales is that Alun Wyn Jones makes an unexpected return, earning his 150th cap \u2013 the first player to reach that total for one country. Dan Biggar retains the captaincy, and will earn his 100th cap today. Jones replaces Will Rowlands in the second row, one of seven changes from the defeat to France. Johnny McNicholl, Louis Rees-Zammit, Willis Halaholo and Gareth Davies come into the backline, with Dewi Lake and Dillon Lewis joining Jones in the pack. Kieran Crowley makes two changes to his Italy side, with Ange Capuozzo earning a start after scoring twice from the bench against Scotland, and Marco Fuser brought in to the second row. Wales: J McNicholl, L Rees-Zammit, O Watkin, U Halaholo, J Adams; D Biggar (c), G Davies; G Thomas, D Lake, D Lewis, A Beard, AW Jones, S Davies, J Navidi, T Faletau. Replacements: B Roberts, W Jones, L Brown, W Rowlands, R Moriarty, K Hardy, C Sheedy, N Tompkins. Italy: A Capuozzo, E Padovani, JI Brex, L Marin, M Ioane; P Garbisi, C Braley; D Fischetti, G Nicotera, P Ceccarelli, M Fuser, F Ruzza, G Pettinelli, M Lamaro (c), T Halafihi. Replacements: L Bigi, C Traore, F Alongi, D Sisi, N Cannone, B Steyn, A Fusco, M Zanon. Wales\u2019s defence of the Six Nations title was all but over after their first game, knocked repeatedly to the canvas by Ireland in Dublin. Since then, Wayne Pivac\u2019s side have played the role of spirited spoilers in this tournament, digging deep across three bruising contests with Scotland, England and France \u2013 all settled by a margin of four points or fewer. For a team in transition, hit once again by a long list of injuries, Wales can take pride from their campaign. That said, the narrow losses may hurt more \u2013 particularly last time out, when they disrupted France\u2019s rhythm but could not land the killer blow. Today offers the chance to find some attacking fluency and end with a flourish against Italy, already assured of their seventh wooden spoon in succession. Wales could still scrape into third place with a bonus-point victory, if other results go their way. Win well today, and their 2022 campaign will go into the history books as a tough job well done. Another close-run thing might change that narrative, though, and if they were to do the unthinkable and lose, all that hard work will have been for nothing. The trophy will be won elsewhere, but the stakes are still high.",

      "bodyText": "Bad news used to arrive in a brown envelope. Now emails and PDFs keep Devon Scott up at night as soaring energy costs and other utilities force the single father of two from Birmingham to cut back. \u201cEverything is going up. The gas bill, phone bill, internet. You think, \u2018Wow. I\u2019m not getting enough money to keep paying for these\u2019, so you limit yourself on the other things you\u2019re spending on,\u201d says the 43-year-old. A former security officer who has worked nightclub doors and building foyers across the West Midlands, Scott, who is unemployed, says it is difficult to look for work with two young boys to look after. He has just \u00a360 left after paying for bills each month out of his universal credit benefits. He expects more bad news from his energy supplier this April in Britain\u2019s worsening cost of living emergency. However, Scott won\u2019t see his benefit payments increase by anywhere near as much under government plans. \u201cIt\u2019s a kick in the teeth,\u201d says Scott, who also has to pay \u00a360 a month in bedroom tax for his council home in the suburb of Stirchley. \u201cWe\u2019re not asking for handouts. There are people out there trying to get their life in order and trying to get off benefits to get a decent job. But these things make it harder.\u201d Pressure is rising on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to use his set piece spring statement on Wednesday to announce a fresh package of emergency support to help Scott and millions of others struggling to make ends meet amid the worst squeeze on living standards for decades. UK household incomes are set for the biggest annual fall since at least the mid-1970s this year, with energy bills due to rise by 54% from the start of next month. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has pushed gas prices to record levels \u2013 leading to warnings of a further jump in October. Against a backdrop of soaring wholesale energy costs, average gas and electricity bills will rise by about \u00a3700 to almost \u00a32,000 a year from April, and experts say the fallout from Vladimir Putin\u2019s war could push average bills to \u00a33,000 a year from October. Before the Russian invasion, Sunak announced a \u00a39bn package of support to deal with the crisis, offering a \u00a3150 council tax discount in April and \u00a3200 repayable loan from October. Vulnerable households eligible for the warm homes discount on their bills can get a further \u00a3150. However, campaigners say urgent further steps are required to prevent a dramatic rise in poverty this year \u2013 saying the single most effective step the chancellor could take at the spring statement would be a bigger increase in the value of universal credit benefits. Such a move would help Scott and many others in Birmingham, which has the highest benefit claimant count rate of major cities in the UK. Official figures show more than one in 10 working-age adults receive support from the state in some areas of the city, which is one of the places likely to be hardest hit by the cost of living crisis. Liam Byrne, the former Labour cabinet minister and West Midlands mayoral candidate, represents the constituency of Hodge Hill. This area of east Birmingham has the highest share of benefit claimants in the UK, leaving its citizens most exposed. \u201cWhat residents talk about is basically being able to keep the fire on in one room of the flat for a few hours a day and that\u2019s it,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re a single mum with a young kid, you\u2019re going to make sure the kid has got enough to eat. But the consequences of that is the kid is going to grow up cold.\u201d Under current plans the government will raise the value of pensions and working-age benefits by 3.1% from April, the rate of inflation recorded in September. However, the Bank of England expects inflation could reach more than double that rate \u2013 with forecasts for the annual rate of rising living costs to hit a 30-year high of 8%. For the 9m households across the UK on means-tested benefits due to low incomes \u2013 both in and out of work \u2013 the plan means an average real-terms cut of \u00a3500 a year, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. As many as 400,000 people could be pulled into poverty as a result. \u201cIt\u2019s so divorced from what\u2019s going on in the lives of poor families today.

      "body": "<p>For seasoned users of the internet, the chronology of our era divides into two ages: BG and AG \u2013 before and after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google\">Google</a>. The year 1998 marks the dividing line. Before then, as the web expanded exponentially, a host of \u201csearch engines\u201d had attempted to provide searchable indexes to it. The best of them was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltaVista\">AltaVista</a>, which launched in 1995 and provided the first searchable, full-text database of the web via a simple interface. It was the engine that I and most of my colleagues used until one fateful day in 1998 when an even starker webpage appeared with a simple text box and almost nothing else except the name Google. And from the moment you first used it, there was no going back.</p> <p>Why? Because Google used an original way of ranking the relevance of the results turned up by a query. It effectively conducted an automated peer review of websites. The more webpages linked to a particular site, the more relevant it was likely to be and so it was given a higher ranking. The algorithm, dubbed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank\">PageRank</a>, which did this was the foundation on which Google\u2019s domination of the internet search was built.</p> <p>The reason Google swept all before it was that its ranking system seemed objective: it just counted links and ranked accordingly. It could be gamed, of course, and a mini-industry of search engine optimisers evolved to try and ensure that a Google search would highly rank their clients\u2019 pages. But Google users could at least be confident that the company itself wasn\u2019t favouring some results over others. No advertising was involved.</p> <p>The company\u2019s founders were adamant that favouring advertisers\u2019 pages would undermine the integrity of their results. \u201cWe expect,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016975529800110X?via%3Dihub\">they wrote</a> in 1998, \u201cthat advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers\u2026 we believe the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it is crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm.\u201d</p> <p>Quite so. But then, after burning investors\u2019 money for two years, the founders discovered in 2000 that high-minded objectivity doesn\u2019t pay the rent and so they morphed into <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016975529800110X?via%3Dihub\">surveillance capitalists</a>, monitoring their users to glean information about them that would be of interest to advertisers.

Despite this, its position as the dominant search engine across large parts of the globe has remained stable since, well, for ever.

You already know subconsciously that Google isn\u2019t going to return a good result.\u201d This struck me as a bit patronising, even though it sparked a chorus of approval on Reddit and Hacker News and even a piece in the New Yorker. The general tenor of the discussion was that only clueless idiots would do a simple Google search rather than the complex formulae available to those who know what they\u2019re doing. Since I don\u2019t have a dog in this fight (I use Google very little and DuckDuckGo most of the time), my hunch is that this is the online equivalent of a storm in a teacup. On the occasions when I use Google, it\u2019s generally for factual stuff and so my experience may be different from that of the Reddit and Hacker News crowd. It may be, as the New Yorker suggests, that the results coming from Google are a reflection of how good the SEO-optimising crowd are at gaming PageRank. The chief executive of DuckDuckGo (who of course does have a dog in the fight) offers three other possible reasons for dissatisfaction with Google. One is users\u2019 aversion to being tracked. Another is annoyance at the way Google prioritises its own products in purchase-related search results. And the third? Simply boredom: we\u2019ve been living in AG for so long that people yearn for something different. If that\u2019s what\u2019s really bugging them, they should remember that solutions are just a click away. What I\u2019ve been reading Left hook Putin\u2019s Challenge to the American Right is a terrific blast from Andrew Sullivan on his blog. Pride before a fall Peter Savodnik\u2019s remarkable essay The Dawn of Uncivilization examines western (and particularly US) hubris post-1989. Lost cause In Preparing for Defeat, Francis Fukuyama outlines (on the American Purpose blog) why he believes Vladimir Putin is destined to lose.",

      "body": "<p>Rishi Sunak is under pressure from Tories and the opposition to make this week\u2019s spring statement into an interventionist mini-budget to tackle the cost of living and impact of the Ukraine war. Here are the key issues:</p> <h2><strong>National insurance</strong></h2> <p>Labour and Tory backbenchers are pressing for April\u2019s planned rise in national insurance to be delayed or scrapped. Announced by Sunak and Boris Johnson last autumn to raise funds for the NHS and social care, it is expected to bring in \u00a312bn. The pair used a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/29/boris-johnson-and-rishi-sunak-double-down-on-national-insurance-rise\" title=\"\">joint letter to a Sunday newspaper</a> to commit to the policy. This could make reopening the issue politically difficult. Calls to scrap it have multiplied given the UK\u2019s worsening cost-of-living crisis and a stronger than expected performance for the economy and government finances in recent months.</p> <h2><strong>Universal </strong><strong>credit</strong></h2> <p>Benefits usually increase in April by the previous September\u2019s rate of inflation, which was 3.1%. Experts say that while the system works when inflation is stable, the recent growth in living costs calls for a bigger rise. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/17/uk-interest-rates-raised-bank-of-england\" title=\"\">Bank of England</a> says inflation could hit 8% this April. </p> <p>Raising benefits by more than planned could constitute an embarrassing U-turn for the chancellor, who staked his reputation on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/sep/19/universal-credit-cut-will-push-800000-people-into-poverty-boris-johnson-warned\" title=\"\">\u00a320 a week cut in universal credit last October</a> \u2013 despite warnings of mounting pressure on households.</p> <h2><strong>Fuel duty</strong></h2> <p>Surging oil prices since the Russian invasion of Ukraine have sent the price of petrol to record highs.

      "bodyText": "Rishi Sunak is under pressure from Tories and the opposition to make this week\u2019s spring statement into an interventionist mini-budget to tackle the cost of living and impact of the Ukraine war. Here are the key issues: National insurance Labour and Tory backbenchers are pressing for April\u2019s planned rise in national insurance to be delayed or scrapped. Announced by Sunak and Boris Johnson last autumn to raise funds for the NHS and social care, it is expected to bring in \u00a312bn. The pair used a joint letter to a Sunday newspaper to commit to the policy. This could make reopening the issue politically difficult. Calls to scrap it have multiplied given the UK\u2019s worsening cost-of-living crisis and a stronger than expected performance for the economy and government finances in recent months. Universal credit Benefits usually increase in April by the previous September\u2019s rate of inflation, which was 3.1%. Experts say that while the system works when inflation is stable, the recent growth in living costs calls for a bigger rise. The Bank of England says inflation could hit 8% this April. Raising benefits by more than planned could constitute an embarrassing U-turn for the chancellor, who staked his reputation on a \u00a320 a week cut in universal credit last October \u2013 despite warnings of mounting pressure on households. Fuel duty Surging oil prices since the Russian invasion of Ukraine have sent the price of petrol to record highs. Tory backbenchers are pushing for a tax cut. Fuel duty is 57.95p a litre, plus 20% VAT. The Conservatives have frozen fuel duty for 12 years but campaigners say this clashes with net-zero ambitions. Energy production Concerns over energy security have fuelled calls for more domestic production. Some Conservatives want fresh investment in shale gas, or net zero rules relaxed for North Sea oil or coal-fired power. Labour want a windfall tax on energy producers, which have benefited from high prices, with the proceeds earmarked for supporting vulnerable families. Defence Senior Tories, including former cabinet minister Jeremy Hunt, have urged Sunak to increase defence spending after the Ukraine invasion. Germany is setting up a \u20ac100bn fund to strengthen its armed forces. The UK spent 2.3% on defence in 2021, Germany 1.5% and the US 3.5%. Business investment Bosses are pressing Sunak for tax and spending plans to encourage business investment. The UK is lagging on this: it plunged after the Brexit vote and again in the pandemic. Despite Sunak\u2019s \u201csuper deduction\u201d tax break, investment is expected to fall again in 2022.

      "body": "<p>Mesmerising work by P&amp;O Ferries, whose decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/18/mass-sacking-by-p-and-o-ferries-a-new-low-for-shipping-says-union\">sack 800 seafaring staff</a> over a Microsoft Teams meeting makes them slightly more distasteful boat owners than several people on the international sanctions list. Indeed, for the duration of the HR chief\u2019s message on Thursday, there may even have been people smugglers in the Channel who would have been more palatable. Certainly, they seem to operate some of the same routes more reliably.</p> <p>And so to how the day unfolded. On Thursday morning, P&amp;O Ferries recalled its vessels to port with the most ominous words in the shipping forecast \u2013 \u201call-colleague announcement\u201d \u2013 promising that \u201clong-term viability\u201d was about to be secured. Sounds good! At which point, the human resources guy delivered <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/video/p-o-ferries-moment-entire-p-o-ferries-crew-got-fired-12568644\">a pre-recorded message</a> from some kind of middle-management bunker, as though he were coordinating the resistance of a besieged eastern European country and not just avoiding having to look any of the staff in the eye when he tells them they\u2019re being \u201crestructured\u201d with immediate effect. The former employees were informed their jobs would be promptly taken over by cheaper agency workers. Whether this is even legal is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/mar/17/what-are-the-legal-implications-of-po-ferries-sacking-800-staff\">matter of some debate</a>; suffice to say the implications of the story continue to unfurl themselves like the petals of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia_arnoldii\">stinking corpse lily</a>.</p> <p>Having made their peace with losing out on Employers of the Year 2022, P&amp;O Ferries apparently followed up the video message by sending balaclava-wearing, handcuff-trained <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10624275/Stranded-passengers-slam-P-O-ferry-firm-cancellations-firm-sacks-crew.html\">private security guards</a> on to the boats to clear away all remaining \u2026 colleagues, is it? Some staff refused to leave their vessels but eventually dispersed when it was suggested that they were risking their severance. Justified outrage is apparently above their paygrade. Sorry \u2013 ex-paygrade.</p> <p>Even the government seems appalled, while a lot of people have a lot of questions. None of which are, \u201cOoh, is that HR guy single?\u201d For the video alone, he must be judged the worst person associated with ferries since Chris Grayling. (Although, as I know you\u2019ll recall, Chris was more associated with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/01/grayling-reaches-33m-settlement-over-brexit-ferry-fiasco-court-case-eurotunnel\">firms that didn\u2019t have any ferries</a>. That was kind of the problem.

      "bodyText": "Mesmerising work by P&amp;O Ferries, whose decision to sack 800 seafaring staff over a Microsoft Teams meeting makes them slightly more distasteful boat owners than several people on the international sanctions list. Indeed, for the duration of the HR chief\u2019s message on Thursday, there may even have been people smugglers in the Channel who would have been more palatable. Certainly, they seem to operate some of the same routes more reliably. And so to how the day unfolded. On Thursday morning, P&amp;O Ferries recalled its vessels to port with the most ominous words in the shipping forecast \u2013 \u201call-colleague announcement\u201d \u2013 promising that \u201clong-term viability\u201d was about to be secured. Sounds good! At which point, the human resources guy delivered a pre-recorded message from some kind of middle-management bunker, as though he were coordinating the resistance of a besieged eastern European country and not just avoiding having to look any of the staff in the eye when he tells them they\u2019re being \u201crestructured\u201d with immediate effect. The former employees were informed their jobs would be promptly taken over by cheaper agency workers. Whether this is even legal is a matter of some debate; suffice to say the implications of the story continue to unfurl themselves like the petals of a stinking corpse lily. Having made their peace with losing out on Employers of the Year 2022, P&amp;O Ferries apparently followed up the video message by sending balaclava-wearing, handcuff-trained private security guards on to the boats to clear away all remaining \u2026 colleagues, is it? Some staff refused to leave their vessels but eventually dispersed when it was suggested that they were risking their severance. Justified outrage is apparently above their paygrade. Sorry \u2013 ex-paygrade. Even the government seems appalled, while a lot of people have a lot of questions. None of which are, \u201cOoh, is that HR guy single?\u201d For the video alone, he must be judged the worst person associated with ferries since Chris Grayling. (Although, as I know you\u2019ll recall, Chris was more associated with firms that didn\u2019t have any ferries. That was kind of the problem. All right, all right \u2013 one of the problems.) I can tell you that a mere four months ago, a P&amp;O honcho was on LinkedIn pushing a video celebrating the company as an employer who wanted to \u201cdo things differently\u201d. As this uplifting film explained of working at the company \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s not just a job; it\u2019s a career. It\u2019s not just a job; it\u2019s the future of seafaring. It\u2019s not just a job; it\u2019s family.\u201d Righto. Unfortunately, it\u2019s the Roy family. What a crew this is.

Puzzling outburst, that one. \u201cThe first thing is to protect the players and we have mentioned that many times,\u201d he continued. \u201cPlease can we avoid the Wednesday night and the Saturday morning and travelling?\u201d Mate, you\u2019ve played at home midweek and then gone to <em>Birmingham</em>. Last week I was at a Spurs game that ended late on a Monday night and had to be in Birmingham by 10am on Tuesday morning. Do you know what? It was absolutely fine, because Birmingham isn\u2019t very far from London. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s Bucharest or Bratislava. \u201cI am not talking about Europe, I am talking about the Premier League and how we schedule the games in the Premier League,\u201d Arteta added. \u201cWhen you are in Europe it is a different story, but I am talking about the Premier League and it is very different.\u201d Well, a bit different, the main differences being that there\u2019s much less journey time to whinge about and a lot of the teams you have to play are less good. </p> <p>Anyway, and to summarise, consider Arsenal\u2019s excuses in early. </p> <p>As for Villa, not since September, when an 88th-minute Kortney Hause goal gave them victory at Old Trafford, have they beaten a current top eight side. Indeed take away Manchester United, whom they also drew with at home in January, and Villa haven\u2019t taken a single point from the top eight teams all season. </p> <p>\u201cThe teams at the top are there for a reason,\u201d said Steven Gerrard. \u201cIt\u2019s about consistency, they\u2019ve recruited well, they\u2019ve got experience and some have got managers who have been with them for some time. That\u2019s the area of the league we need to strive for, it\u2019s where we want to be operating of course. I\u2019m very much aware of the stats and those results but tomorrow gives us another opportunity to try to prove that when we\u2019re at our best we can take points off the top teams.\u201d</p> <p>So in short, Villa want to win and Arsenal want to be somewhere else. Let\u2019s see what happens, shall we?</p> </div>   </div>",

Mikel Arteta is pleased: We talked a lot before the match that we had to be sharp, and physical, and clever in what we wanted to do, and we controlled the game. We totally controlled it. The shame was we didn\u2019t score the second goal and the third one, and when you do that you\u2019re going to dig deep in the last few minutes. That\u2019s where we have to take the team. I\u2019m really pleased with the quality, how we competed in every phase of the game. I\u2019m really proud of the boys. Here\u2019s that Gerrard interview. Prickly. Steve Gerrard has an interesting chat with BT Sport. \u201cI actually thought your questions would be a little bit better. Nothing personal,\u201d he tells Des Kelly. Also: It was a tough first half because wee allowed it to be tough. I thought our performance lacked belief and it wasn\u2019t until half-time that we showed we could improve. We were much better first half, second half we deserved to be behind, I thought we were second best. We set up today to be aggressive but I thought we lacked a bit of belief in what we were doing and a few individuals lacked belief. It\u2019s hard to perform when not everybody believes in it. We managed to create three or four interesting moments in the game, but I\u2019ve got no complaints with the scoreline. Nick Ames has filed his match report from Villa Park: This was a test Arsenal needed to pass and they did so with conviction, even if the margin of victory was narrow. They had lost here in their previous two visits but this time a similar outcome was never on: a fluent and controlled performance, particularly during a first half in which they afforded Aston Villa almost nothing, ensured their claim to fourth place looks overwhelming and it was a good way to banish any hangover from Wednesday\u2019s home defeat to Liverpool. Bukayo Saka\u2019s crisp strike on the half-hour was enough to restore their momentum and, although they were visibly tired towards the end, a mainly disappointing Villa only showed occasional signs of changing the mood. Much more here: Bukayo Saka says this was \u201ca very big win. On the back of the Liverpool defeat today was even bigger\u201d. He also says why he had a chat with the referee on his way off the field: \u201cI wasn\u2019t complaining, I just wanted to let him know that\u2019s my game, I\u2019m going to run at players and sometimes I need a bit more protection when players are purposely trying to kick me.\u201d That Leno save from Coutinho\u2019s free-kick was by no means extraordinary, but he was absolutely mobbed by teammates when the final whistle sounded. This kind of spirit is just as encouraging as this kind of performance, I think. The league table looks pretty good for Arsenal, four points clear of fifth place, six points clear of sixth, and with a game in hand over both. 90+6 mins: Villa take an age to get ready before finally Coutinho curls the free-kick towards the far corner. Leno punches it clear, and the final whistle goes! 90+5 mins: With Villa out of time and ideas Pepe fouls Douglas Luiz on the left, and the home side will end the game with a dangerous free-kick. Up comes the keeper! 90+3 mins: Villa send a long cross onto Traore\u2019s head, but he heads wide instead of back across goal, and was offside anyway. 90+2 mins: Steve McManaman picks Saka as his man of the match, obeying the law of the scorer in a 1-0 game. Saka was much better in the first half (before that Mings foul) than the second, but he\u2019s a lovely player and deserves a full mantelpiece. 90+1 mins: There will be four minutes of stoppage time. 89 mins: Bailey hits a good cross from the left, but there\u2019s nobody at the far post to even try to win it. Tierney nods it behind for a corner, which Traore nods behind for a goal kick. 87 mins: \u201cThey\u2019re booing Saka this much for scoring? I don\u2019t get it,\u201d boggles Zach Neeley. He wasn\u2019t booed for scoring, he was booed for getting fouled. 87 mins: Cash runs 30 yards, ends up with Arsenal players all around him and nobody to pass to, so turns and passes the ball back 30 yards again. 86 mins: Ings sends a header looping onto the roof of the net, and Arsenal bring Rob Holding on for Odegaard. 84 mins: Arsenal\u2019s defensive organisation and commitment has been impressive, from front to back. That is not a sentence I\u2019ve been able to write for a while. Their forwards have worked like absolute hounds to deny Villa any easy possession. 81 mins: Ings replaces Watkins. There doesn\u2019t seem a lot of point replacing your striker if the rest of the team can\u2019t create a chance for them, but you never know. 79 mins: Another excellent Young cross, but again Arsenal win the header. On the bench, Ings is getting ready to come on. 77 mins: Lacazette comes off, and Nketiah comes on. 74 mins: A lovely ball from Smith Rowe to Lacazette carves the home defence wide open, but the Frenchman has a shot instead of playing Odegaard through on goal, and it\u2019s well blocked. 71 mins: For the first time in the match, Villa are building up something of a head of steam. Young runs between Soares and Pepe and goes down, but the referee isn\u2019t impressed. Then Douglas Luiz tries to find Coutinho\u2019s run, but overhits the pass. 69 mins: Bukayo Saka is booed by the home fans as he heads to the touchline as he\u2019s taken off. Nicolas Pepe is on. Villa meanwhile bring on Leon Bailey and Bertrand Traore for Ramsey and Buendia. 68 mins: Villa hit the post! Watkins cuts inside from the left and his shot skids off Tierney\u2019s thigh and into the woodwork. 66 mins: Douglas Luiz curls the free kick way over the bar. 65 mins: Partey clatters into Cash, bringing him down, earning himself a booking and presenting Villa with a shooting chance, albeit from long range. 64 mins: Saka has an almost identical shot to that McGinn one, only with his left foot. It also skids wide. 62 mins: \u201cWould Steven Gerrard enhance his prospects on landing his dream job by winning things in Scotland or grinding to 8th-12th for the next five seasons at Villa?\u201d wonders Gary Naylor. \u201cIt\u2019s a genuine question I feel.\u201d Unlike most young managers Gerrard has the advantage of having a big club that\u2019s predisposed to like him, though I suppose several others will be predisposed not to. Generally I think the only way for an English manager to get a job at one of the regular Champions League-qualifying teams is to first manage a lesser team into the Champions League and/or league title contention. Villa seems a decent place to attempt that? 60 mins: Chance for Villa! The ball rebounds to the feet of McGinn, 20 yards out, but he curls wide! That\u2019s their first shot of the game. 57 mins: Ashley Young does a nice shimmy to fool Cedric, but then goes down under absolutely no contact, wins a free kick and earns Cedric a booking. 55 mins: Arsenal are pushing for a second here. You\u2019d have thought that in the next few minutes either the scoreline will change, or Villa\u2019s team will. 53 mins: Ramsey goes down under a little bit of pressure from Saka, leaving Villa in a whole heap of trouble when the referee doesn\u2019t give a free kick. Saka runs into the area, cuts onto his right foot, but takes a slightly heavy touch and is closed down. 52 mins: Young cuts inside from the left and sends a delicious cross towards the far post, but Gabriel wins the header and sends it behind. 51 mins: Arsenal win the ball on halfway and spring forward, but Xhaka\u2019s shot hits Konsa\u2019s calf and spins behind. 48 mins: The Gunners win a corner, which is pulled back to Smith Rowe on the edge of the D, but his shot is a bit feeble and Martinez catches. 47 mins: No personnel changes at the interval, and Arsena have restarted, as they began the first half, on the front foot. 46 mins: The players are back out and the game is back on. \u201cMissed the first half (slept off, don\u2019t ask...), and just reading your posts for updates,\u201d writes Baganboy on Twitter. \u201cSeems Villa has been okay but unlucky, and Arsenal truly evil in the first half. Is that a fair reading?\u201d Not really: Arsenal were really impressive for most of the half, but it\u2019s almost like they switched once they had a league to protect from fluent attacking and entertainment to focusing a little more on provocation. 45+4 mins: The visitors deservedly lead at the break, but the game has taken a bit of a bad-spirited turn since the goal and unless there\u2019s significant cooling-off done at the break the second half could get spicy. 45+2 mins: There will be three minutes of stoppage time, or somesuch. 45 mins: Xhaka gets the booking that has been coming for a while, for a gentle push on Buendia. Taking that incident in isolation that\u2019s an absurdly harsh booking, but then I\u2019m sure Andy Madley isn\u2019t. 43 mins: Arsenal send a set piece into the Villa area. Martinez claims it, and Xhaka sprints 15 yards to get in his way and stop him releasing the ball quickly. Every bit as cynical as the tactical fouls that are now normally rewarded with a booking, and with similar intentions. 42 mins: Replays show Partey\u2019s \u201cmarking\u201d of Mings at a corner a couple of minutes ago, very much the kind of shenanigans that a VAR might have been interested in. 40 mins: \u201cWhy do referees never book players for surrounding him like the Arsenal players did there?\u201d asks Samuel of that melee. \u201cHe\u2019s given the foul is going to book Mings, everything is in control but those players go steaming in and make everything look worse. Not one of them checked to see if Saka was OK so it would seem getting someone getting sent off is more important than making sure their team mate is ok. Any wonder the respect campaign died before it started.\u201d I have had the pleasure of watching most Premier League sides beat my team this season, and have noted the ones who did so with grace and good sporstmanship (Crystal Palace impressed, unexpectedly), and those who exhibited little of either. Arsenal were very much towards the extreme end of the latter group. 38 mins: A nice Arsenal break ends with Tierney waiting a moment until Cash is upon him, and then hitting a cross straight into him. 36 mins: A pass towards Saka runs out of play, and the home fans boo the prospect of his involvement, and cheer when he doesn\u2019t reach it. 35 mins: McGinn also gets booked for something he did during that little fracas. Saka is treated on the pitch for a couple of minutes but is back on his feet and ready to play on. 32 mins: Handbags! Mings brings Saka down with the follow-through from a sliding challenge and most of the Arsenal team react angrily, most of the Villa team come over to stand up for their man, and it all gets a little pushy-shovey. The referee waits for VAR to have a good look and then shows Mings a yellow - it was a pretty good tackle until he took Saka out, certainly not two-footed or out of control. Arsenal, and Saka\u2019s low shot, find a way through! Cedric\u2019s long cross is headed down, bobbles off a few players to Saka, whose first-time half-volley isn\u2019t cleanly hit but finds a way through a posse of players, surprises a clearly unsighted Martinez, and hits the net! 27 mins: A vague sniff of something for Villa. Coutinho\u2019s nice flick lets Watkins run towards the Arsenal area, but Cedric Soares spots the danger and comes across to snuff it out. \u201cIt\u2019s been interesting charting the fall and rise of Cedric\u2019s reputation recently,\u201d says Charles Antaki. \u201cPre-Tomiyasu it was dreadful, then Tomiyasu arrived and played well and Cedric was simply forgotten. Tomiyasu got injured and there was much wailing and gnashing of teeth as Cedric re-remerged and people recalled how rotten he was \u2026 then he played Ok \u2026 then he played well ... and now it\u2019s he\u2019s commanding grudging near-respect. A bit more of this and he\u2019ll turn into an indispensable legend (before he has one dreadful game and it\u2019s down back the snake again).\u201d 23 mins: McGinn gives the ball away really poorly on the edge of his own area, but there are enough defenders around to stop Arsenal profiting. A quarter of the way through, Arsenal remain on the front foot and Villa are yet to have a shot. 21 mins: Villa nearly conjure something, McGinn sending a lovely dipping diagonal ball into the area for Watkins, but White throws out a leg and stop it reaching him. 18 mins: Big miss! Arsenal work the ball out to Saka on the right and he exchanges passes with Odegaard, pulls the ball past the keeper at the near post and across goal, where Smith Rowe makes a last-minute burst to reach it before Lacazette and send it wide! 15 mins: Jacob Ramsey is booked for bringing Smith Rowe down with a sliding challenge. 13 mins: \u201cI\u2019m fortunate to be in Edinburgh today for their summer, as today is as bright and sunny as in the photo taken outside Villa Park, and the temperature is in double figures,\u201d writes Kev. \u201cThe sunshine has brought out the Ice Cream vans and that had me wondering, will the Villa be known as Aston Vanilla if Arsenal give them a good licking today?\u201d But what if it goes the other way? Arsenalmond? 10 mins: That\u2019s a better save! Saka\u2019s left-footed cross from the right is chested by Konsa and would have gone just inside the post had Martinez not tipped it wide! That would have been a really weird own goal: that was very much a deliberate chest by Konsa, not an inadvertent deflection, and I have no idea what he was thinking when he decided it was a good idea. 9 mins: The night\u2019s first save comes from Martinez. Luckily the shot he saves comes from Partey, who from a tasty position a yard or so outside the area sidefoots straight at the keeper. 9 mins: McGinn sends in a lovely cross from the free-kick, but nobody gets on the end of it and it flicks off a defender and behind for a corner, which White heads clear. 8 mins: Soares blocks off Young\u2019s run as he attempts a one-two with Buendia, and Villa now have a free-kick just outside Arsenal\u2019s area. 7 mins: Arsenal have started the game well, repeatedly winning the ball back around halfway and keeping it impressively. We await Villa\u2019s first attack. 3 mins: Shot! Young misjudges a pass to Saka, who gets free down the right and pulls back to Odegaard. It\u2019s an almost identical pull-back to the one that led to a goal at Watford a few weeks back, and to the same player, but this time his path to goal is blocked so he lays off to Smith-Rowe, who blasts over. 2 mins: Early touches for the two keepers as McGinn\u2019s overhit pass runs through to Leno, whose overhit pass is tapped back to Martinez by Mings. 1 min: Peeeeep! The game has begun! This is true, except Ron was his grandad. \u201cThe day my mum found out she was pregnant with me was the day he died, and his name was Ron,\u201d Ramsdale said last year. \u201cHe was from Bloxwich in Birmingham and they used to say \u2018oh, we\u2019re going to go see our Ron\u2019 or \u2018our Barbara\u2019. So I\u2019m Aaron for \u2018our Ron\u2019.\u201d The players are gathering in the tunnel. As I type, Emi Martinez is giving Granit Xhaka a hug. Some injury news: Callum Chambers has \u201chad some awareness of his muscle\u201d, according to Steven Gerrard. Aaron Ramsdale \u201cwill be out for a few weeks\u201d, says Mikel Arteta. It looks a gorgeous sunny day in Birmingham, cool, bright, and generally perfect for playing, or indeed watching, a game of football. Team news is in, and here it is. Villa make three changes and Arsenal two, the visitors saying Aaron Ramsdale has a hip injury and Gabriel Martinelli is unwell: Aston Villa: Martinez, Cash, Konsa, Mings, Young, McGinn, Douglas Luiz, Ramsey, Buendia, Watkins, Coutinho. Subs: Sanson, Traore, Chambers, Ings, Olsen, Bailey, Chukwuemeka, Iroegbunam, O\u2019Reilly. Arsenal: Leno, Cedric, White, Gabriel, Tierney, Odegaard, Partey, Xhaka, Saka, Lacazette, Smith Rowe. Subs: Holding, Pepe, Tavares, Sambi Lokonga, Elneny, Nketiah, Okonkwo, Swanson, Hutchinson. Referee: Andrew Madley. Well here we are. The game Mikel Arteta complained it was \u201cnot fair\u201d for his team to play, what with also having played against Liverpool on Wednesday night. Puzzling outburst, that one. \u201cThe first thing is to protect the players and we have mentioned that many times,\u201d he continued. \u201cPlease can we avoid the Wednesday night and the Saturday morning and travelling?\u201d Mate, you\u2019ve played at home midweek and then gone to Birmingham. Last week I was at a Spurs game that ended late on a Monday night and had to be in Birmingham by 10am on Tuesday morning. Do you know what? It was absolutely fine, because Birmingham isn\u2019t very far from London. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s Bucharest or Bratislava. \u201cI am not talking about Europe, I am talking about the Premier League and how we schedule the games in the Premier League,\u201d Arteta added. \u201cWhen you are in Europe it is a different story, but I am talking about the Premier League and it is very different.\u201d Well, a bit different, the main differences being that there\u2019s much less journey time to whinge about and a lot of the teams you have to play are less good. Anyway, and to summarise, consider Arsenal\u2019s excuses in early. As for Villa, not since September, when an 88th-minute Kortney Hause goal gave them victory at Old Trafford, have they beaten a current top eight side. Indeed take away Manchester United, whom they also drew with at home in January, and Villa haven\u2019t taken a single point from the top eight teams all season. \u201cThe teams at the top are there for a reason,\u201d said Steven Gerrard. \u201cIt\u2019s about consistency, they\u2019ve recruited well, they\u2019ve got experience and some have got managers who have been with them for some time. That\u2019s the area of the league we need to strive for, it\u2019s where we want to be operating of course. I\u2019m very much aware of the stats and those results but tomorrow gives us another opportunity to try to prove that when we\u2019re at our best we can take points off the top teams.\u201d So in short, Villa want to win and Arsenal want to be somewhere else. Let\u2019s see what happens, shall we?",

      "body": "<p>Born in Brussels in 1972, Brian Molko is the frontman of alternative rock band <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/12/placebo-its-not-the-end-of-the-world-its-just-the-end-of-the-human-species\">Placebo</a>. Co-founded with Stefan Olsdal, the band released their eponymous debut album, which included breakthrough single Nancy Boy, in 1996. Over the following years they became known for their androgynous style, hedonistic lyrics and Molko\u2019s distinctive vocals, and in 1998 they appeared in Todd Haynes\u2019s film <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian/0,,44299,00.html\">Velvet Goldmine</a></em>. Placebo have released seven albums to date, including <em>Without You I\u2019m Nothing</em> and <em>Meds</em>.

When it was first released in 2000, it was the first alternative rock album I\u2019d heard about our developing relationship with computers and technology. It\u2019s fascinating to listen back now, because all the loneliness and disconnect we feel today, it\u2019s all there already. When I listen to it, it\u2019s like sadness is pouring out of the speakers like molasses or treacle. There are songs about trying to find someone you love on internet-controlled CCTV, or losing a friend in a commercial space travel accident. I can\u2019t believe how prescient it was. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8ec5c0aeb3be89281f1d33e37d9eb0a8da61bb3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ec5c0aeb3be89281f1d33e37d9eb0a8da61bb3c/0_0_1713_2560/669.jpg\" alt=\"In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts by Gabor Mat\u00e9\" width=\"669\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>2.

Modern addiction treatment hasn\u2019t really evolved much in the past 50 to 100 years \u2013 it\u2019s pretty much a one-size-fits-all approach, from my experience \u2013 but this book feels like a real gamechanger. Dr <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/nov/24/joanna-moorhead-gabriel-mate-trauma-addiction-treat\">Gabor Mat\u00e9</a> believes that most addiction is the result of unresolved and unprocessed trauma, usually from childhood, which continues to play out in our daily lives. So the question he feels we should be asking is not why the addiction; rather, why the pain? Because that\u2019s basically what most addiction is about: it\u2019s about feelings, and creating coping mechanisms to anaesthetise these feelings.</p> <h2><strong>3.

It wasn\u2019t unlike a Bill Viola exhibition: there were these massive video screens that took you through his development, training and personality to show how he grew into being the choreographer that he became.

      "bodyText": "Born in Brussels in 1972, Brian Molko is the frontman of alternative rock band Placebo. Co-founded with Stefan Olsdal, the band released their eponymous debut album, which included breakthrough single Nancy Boy, in 1996. Over the following years they became known for their androgynous style, hedonistic lyrics and Molko\u2019s distinctive vocals, and in 1998 they appeared in Todd Haynes\u2019s film Velvet Goldmine. Placebo have released seven albums to date, including Without You I\u2019m Nothing and Meds. Their eighth album, Never Let Me Go, is released on So Recordings on 25 March; they tour the UK later this year. 1. Album Grandaddy \u2013 The Sophtware Slump (20th anniversary) I love this record. When it was first released in 2000, it was the first alternative rock album I\u2019d heard about our developing relationship with computers and technology. It\u2019s fascinating to listen back now, because all the loneliness and disconnect we feel today, it\u2019s all there already. When I listen to it, it\u2019s like sadness is pouring out of the speakers like molasses or treacle. There are songs about trying to find someone you love on internet-controlled CCTV, or losing a friend in a commercial space travel accident. I can\u2019t believe how prescient it was. 2. Book In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts by Gabor Mat\u00e9 This is a really important book about addiction. Modern addiction treatment hasn\u2019t really evolved much in the past 50 to 100 years \u2013 it\u2019s pretty much a one-size-fits-all approach, from my experience \u2013 but this book feels like a real gamechanger. Dr Gabor Mat\u00e9 believes that most addiction is the result of unresolved and unprocessed trauma, usually from childhood, which continues to play out in our daily lives. So the question he feels we should be asking is not why the addiction; rather, why the pain? Because that\u2019s basically what most addiction is about: it\u2019s about feelings, and creating coping mechanisms to anaesthetise these feelings. 3. TV Preacher (Amazon Prime/AMC) If you like your TV escapist and sacrilegious and sexy and comically violent, this is your show. God has left heaven and gone walkabout; meanwhile, the spirit of creation has broken free and is zooming around the Earth trying to find a suitable host, and assassin-type angels are trying to track it down. And that\u2019s just the first episode. Ruth Negga and Joseph Gilgun get total career-defining roles in this series. It\u2019s a modern Life of Brian on psychedelics \u2013 I\u2019ve recently rewatched the whole thing and it\u2019s just as thrilling the second time round. 4. Exhibition Michael Clark: Cosmic Dancer, V&amp;A Dundee This career retrospective pretty much gathered up all the footage from Michael Clark\u2019s history. It wasn\u2019t unlike a Bill Viola exhibition: there were these massive video screens that took you through his development, training and personality to show how he grew into being the choreographer that he became. My highlight was when he started to work with the legend that is Leigh Bowery, and the ballet he created for the Fall called I Am Curious, Orange. His work had been quite calm and contemplative up until then, and then he hit his punk period and it got really fun, really noisy. 5. Film Children of Men (dir Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, 2006) This is set in a dystopian near-future in London. I rewatched it a few times, before and after Brexit kicked in, when I was making the decision to leave the UK. I felt so psychologically brutalised by what was going on that I could really relate to this film again. The police state vision of future England in this movie was slowly becoming a reality: heavily armed police patrols on the streets, refugees and immigrants locked up in camps. Julianne Moore and Clive Owen are excellent, but top prize goes to Michael Caine, who plays this long-haired hippy stoner \u2013 his performance is absolutely hilarious. 6. App Birdsong.fm I hate memes, but I did see one recently of a hipster saying: \u201cOh man, I don\u2019t listen to bands any more, they\u2019re all on major labels. I only listen to birdsong.\u201d And it made me think of me, because I don\u2019t listen to much music, I\u2019d often rather listen to birdsong.

      "body": "<p>Ruth Madeley hadn\u2019t intended to cause a commotion in the quiet carriage. She was taking the train to a script read-through on an entirely unremarkable March 2016 morning when, out of the blue, her phone started to ping at an unusual pace. She gave apologetic looks to the commuters tutting at the incessant buzzing. But once she\u2019d looked down at the screen, she stopped caring what other people thought.</p> <p>\u201cI picked up my phone and read the first Twitter post,\u201d Madeley says. \u201cBafta nominations for Best Actress: Suranne Jones, Claire Foy, Sheridan Smith\u2026 and me. I couldn\u2019t shitting believe it.\u201d</p> <p>Nine months earlier, <em>Don\u2019t Take My Baby</em>, a drama about two disabled parents fighting to keep their newborn child, had been broadcast on BBC Three. It\u2019s been estimated that thousands of babies are removed from disabled couples annually in the UK; Madeley played one such mother fighting to keep her daughter. There\u2019d been talk on set about the production being something special and, when it first aired, it received an impressive reception. Still, when Madeley saw that notification from Bafta, she was gobsmacked. It was her first leading TV role.</p> <p>\u201cI pushed the phone away and just sat there breathing deeply,\u201d Madeley remembers. \u201cHoly shit. All these women I watched on TV and thought of as powerhouses. And I was in a category with them? It still feels ridiculous to me.\u201d</p> <p>Years might have passed, but Madeley still gets a thrill reliving that moment. When she retells the story, sitting in the glam room behind an east London studio, the 34-year-old actor breaks out into an ear-to-ear grin. Madeley was born with spina bifida and uses a wheelchair. When she began acting, she wanted to tell untold stories \u2013 to be successful, disabled and visible. To her, the nomination was confirmation she\u2019d been seen. \u201cDoing this has never just been about acting for me, and it never will be,\u201d she says. \u201cI know that with every role I do, there\u2019ll be disabled teenagers at home watching TV. I\u2019d never seen anyone like me, but maybe these ones could.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"87f1c0e48190c44cbd3083753d91d487bd5fdc40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87f1c0e48190c44cbd3083753d91d487bd5fdc40/0_203_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ticket to ride: a scene from Then Barbara Met Alan, with Arthur Hughes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ticket to ride: a scene from Then Barbara Met Alan, with Arthur Hughes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Dore/BBC/Dragonfly</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We\u2019re meeting now to talk about <em>Then Barbara Met Alan</em>, Madeley\u2019s latest project. In it, she plays Barbara Lisicki, a pioneering disability rights campaigner. It follows Lisicki and her partner Alan Holdsworth (played by Arthur Hughes), who are cabaret performers and activists, in their efforts to see the passing of the 1995 Disability Discrimination Act. It\u2019s set in the early 90s when, far from being equal citizens, disabled people faced huge barriers in the workplace, often lived in poor-quality housing, had little access to accessible transport and few rights enshrined in law.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a love story first and foremost,\u201d Madeley says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not preachy or jumping on a soapbox to talk about disability policy. It\u2019s a badass way for disabled people to talk about how they had to fight for their rights to get that bill through parliament, and the legacy it left.\u201d</p> <p>Madeley was a child when the protests and riots were unfolding. In early adulthood, she began to learn a little more. \u201cIn my 20s, I researched them myself: watching documentaries, deep-diving into recent history.\u201d This project presented an opportunity to celebrate those heroes who sacrificed so much and put their bodies on the line.</p> <p>Naturally, Madeley says, she\u2019s a glass-half-full kind of person. \u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t have been,\u201d she explains, \u201cbut I was shocked at how much of what they were demanding we are still fighting for today.\u201d</p> <p>There are the practical things: so many disabled people still don\u2019t have access to public transport. \u201cBut the majority of barriers I face as a disabled person aren\u2019t physical,\u201d Madeley says. \u201cIn theory, transport is easy to get fixed if there\u2019s willing, but perceptions of what it means to be disabled are the biggest problem.\u201d You can\u2019t simply install a ramp to change people\u2019s minds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d911d466ccde5b6110149c6445f47012c366decc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d911d466ccde5b6110149c6445f47012c366decc/0_1391_5400_5727/943.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Hollywood, please!\u2019: Ruth Madeley wears velvet jacket, trousers and cotton shirt, all by gucci.com.\" width=\"943\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Hollywood, please!\u2019: Ruth Madeley <br>wears velvet jacket, trousers and cotton shirt, all by <a href=\"https://www.gucci.com/uk/en_gb/\">gucci.com</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gustavo Papaleo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just last year, a minicab driver refused to drop her outside Euston station\u2019s accessible entrance, stating that heavy traffic made it \u201ctoo difficult\u201d. He subsequently refused to return her wheelchair. When she reported the incident to the Metropolitan police, Madeley was told it wasn\u2019t a hate crime: \u201cI was shut down and made to feel as though I was making a fuss over nothing.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s why Madeley has no qualms, she explains, with being labelled a \u201cdisabled actor\u201d, or us spending time on the topic. She wants these conversations both to be had and heard. \u201cIt\u2019s why I feel in such a privileged and powerful position to be in the industry I\u2019m in,\u201d she says, with more than a hint of determination. \u201cIf you put disability at the forefront in the media and popular culture, you can change preconceptions of what disability is. That it\u2019s not a death sentence.\u201d For Madeley, it\u2019s more than just being present: \u201cIt means telling stories that change how people think.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>As childhoods go,</strong></em> much of Madeley\u2019s was blissfully ordinary. Mum was a nurse, Dad worked in customer services. Home was Bolton, where she still lives today, with her partner of nine years. But hospitals were a constant presence. Having been born with spina bifida \u2013 a condition that meant her spinal cord didn\u2019t develop fully in utero \u2013 trips to the doctor were part and parcel of daily life.</p> <p>\u201cWe always knew I\u2019d need surgery on my spine,\u201d Madeley explains. Her condition developed into neuromuscular scoliosis. \u201cBy the time I hit 11, we\u2019d started talking about a major corrective procedure where metal rods would be put into my back to straighten it.\u201d</p> <p>It was a lot for a young person to grapple with, but as much as possible Madeley didn\u2019t let it get to her. A year later, the surgeries started. \u201cIt was meant to be one operation,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it just kept going a bit pear shaped, and it ended up dragging on all the way through secondary school.\u201d In all, Madeley missed a year and a half of in-person education; she completed her GCSE coursework from a hospital bed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fd0051cb46ceb49e380dfde44e8a9196758610b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fd0051cb46ceb49e380dfde44e8a9196758610b/0_198_5940_3564/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Curtain raiser: with Daniel Monks in Teenage Dick at the Donmar Warehouse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Curtain raiser: with Daniel Monks in Teenage Dick at the Donmar Warehouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Brenner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe recovery process for any spinal surgery is boringly long,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m an incredibly impatient person. That healing kept getting delayed as things went wrong, so I felt I was wasting time.\u201d There were tough periods, but in the end, the procedures were successful. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t traumatic,\u201d she says, \u201cand honestly aside from that I had a great time: Take That, Spice Girls, Barbies. I was living the 90s dream.\u201d</p> <p>After leaving school, Madeley studied creative writing and English at Edge Hill University in Lancashire. She\u2019d contemplated being a vet and a fashion designer before settling on the idea of being a writer: both previous plans had been abandoned when Madeley accepted she wasn\u2019t particularly practical and didn\u2019t have the stomach to put down people\u2019s pets. \u201cI\u2019d always loved film and TV,\u201d Madeley says, \u201cand was very aware I never saw anyone like me in programmes. So, I thought, I\u2019ll write those characters instead.\u201d</p> <p>Just after graduation, Madeley landed herself a work placement with the BBC\u2019s script-editing team. It was interesting, but pretty quickly she added \u201cworking a 9-5 desk job\u201d to her list of \u201ccareer cannots\u201d. It was there, though, that Madeley met a producer who suggested she audition for a part in an episode of a CBBC drama on a whim. \u201cShe told me they were looking for a wheelchair user,\u201d says Madeley, \u201cand asked if I\u2019d go along.\u201d Other than her show-stealing performance as Mary in a primary school nativity, she\u2019d never considered acting. \u201cBut I\u2019m nosy, so I agreed.\u201d</p> <p>Mostly, Madeley was keen to understand the casting process. One day, she hoped, her own scripts would go through it. When asked where she\u2019d trained at the audition, Madeley shrugged and explained she just worked up the hallway. Turns out, she was a natural. Madeley bagged the part.</p> <p>\u201cI thought if I was lucky it could be a side hustle,\u201d she says. This was no everything-clicks-into-place revelatory moment. \u201cI saw it as a way to keep building contacts in the industry and while I don\u2019t want to say that I didn\u2019t think it was possible \u2013 I try to be one of those insufferable \u2018you can do anything\u2019 types \u2013 there really was nobody who looked like me making work on screen.\u201d</p> <p>Afterwards, Madeley took a job in fundraising for Whizz Kids, a charity that buys mobility equipment for disabled children; they\u2019d helped purchase her first wheelchair, aged five. Creativity took a backseat: bit parts popped up, occasionally; she wrote at the weekend. And then, the script for <em>Don\u2019t Take My Baby</em> landed on her desk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f93042f63d9582fcd97a96ab4764f3939e16a34f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f93042f63d9582fcd97a96ab4764f3939e16a34f/0_1605_5400_3241/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I\u2019m an incredibly impatient person\u2019: Ruth Madeley wears dress by Rejina Pyo (fenwick.co.uk).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019m an incredibly impatient person\u2019: Ruth Madeley wears dress by Rejina Pyo (<a href=\"https://www.fenwick.co.uk/\">fenwick.co.uk</a>).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gustavo Papaleo/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI knew right away I needed to do it,\u201d Madeley recalls, \u201cthat I would fight people in the street for it; I wasn\u2019t going to be gracious.\u201d Thankfully, none of that was necessary. Madeley, again, was cast.</p> <p>As breakout roles go, it was all-consuming. \u201cIt was hard, emotionally taxing,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not a mum, so I hadn\u2019t had the experience of having a child. Oh my God, I thought, if I have children, am I going to have the authorities knocking at my door? That was frightening.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Meanwhile, she was</strong></em> learning on the job, petrified that production would pick up on her lack of leading lady experience. It made the Bafta nomination all the more reassuring when it came.</p> <p>The day after the ceremony, however, Madeley was back in the Whizz Kids office, hitting the phones to fundraise. \u201cI just assumed it would all be over after that,\u201d she says, \u201chonestly I still think that now. I never imagined there\u2019d be longevity.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just that having a regular paycheque was comforting. \u201cI was also scared there wouldn\u2019t be enough roles,\u201d she says. \u201cDisability did play into that. Still thinking I\u2019ll only get called when they need a <em>disabled</em> actress. The industry has underestimated disabled people for so long that it\u2019s no wonder that\u2019s how I felt.\u201d</p> <p>For the next three years, Madeley only moonlighted as an actor. When parts came along, she\u2019d use annual leave or make up the hours at nights or weekends. \u201cIt was only after I took a six-month unpaid sabbatical to film Russell T Davies\u2019s <em>Years and Years</em>,\u201d Madeley says, \u201cthat something shifted.\u201d On her first day back \u2013 having already been offered her next gig \u2013 Madeley had a word with her boss. \u201cWould you mind,\u201d she asked, earnestly, \u201cif I slightly extended my sabbatical?\u201d It would only be, she assured her manager, two months tops. \u201cI remember my boss said to me: \u2018Ruth, I think you\u2019re an actress now.\u2019 That\u2019s when it hit me.

She counts herself lucky to have worked on projects where disability is at the forefront of the narrative, and others where it has barely played a part.</p> <p>She knows that hasn\u2019t always been the experience of others, both past and present. \u201cI know that for too long, and for lots of people, this was closed off,\u201d she says, \u201cthat actors would be told, explicitly, they\u2019ll only be seen for \u2018disabled\u2019 roles.\u201d</p> <p>Finding a balance, she believes, has proved important. There has been an impressive array of roles in the past six years, but this is the first time since <em>Don\u2019t Take My Baby</em> when a story about disability takes centre stage.</p> <p>\u201cFor so long, disabled actors were pigeonholed,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t want to lose those disabled stories, the ones we were only allowed to play before. Because we do need to tell them. But you want them told authentically, with disabled people in front of and behind the camera.\u201d This, she believes, is what <em>When Barbara Met Alan</em> achieves. \u201cIt\u2019s a cool, punk middle finger,\u201d she says, \u201cstrong and empowering, with disabled people at the helm.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s about far more than representation, Madeley reckons. The result sees the experiences of disabled people depicted in a way that others might not otherwise consider. How disabled bodies are seen and presented, she\u2019s clear, is an integral part.</p> <p>While making <em>Don\u2019t Take My Baby</em>, the day came where Madeley would have to shoot a shower scene. \u201cThey came in with my costume: two nipple covers and a pair of pants,\u201d she says. In retrospect it\u2019s all rather funny. \u201cBut back then I was totally petrified.\u201d She locked herself in the bathroom and phoned her sister, desperate to find an out. \u201cShe talked me down,\u201d Madeley says, still grateful, \u201ctelling me: \u2018You are doing this for 15-year-old you, and all the 15-year-old yous out there now. Who never see their bodies, their scars.\u201d Once they\u2019d wrapped for the day? \u201cIt was the best feeling in the world.\u201d</p> <p>The sex scene in <em>Then Barbara Met Alan</em> felt just as liberating. \u201cAfter we shot it,\u201d Madeley says, \u201cone of our directors stopped us and said we needed to take a moment to talk about it. I don\u2019t think it had been done before: two visibly disabled characters, played by two disabled actors, in a loving \u2013 and sexy \u2013 sex scene.\u201d For all present, it felt like a milestone. Spending time with Madeley leaves you in no doubt there\u2019ll be many more to come.</p> <p>Because, already, there\u2019s plenty in the pipeline, both her own projects and other acting jobs. She\u2019d love to tell me about them, she assures me, beaming, but sadly can\u2019t. And in the long term? \u201cHollywood, please,\u201d Madeley says, not skipping a beat, unashamedly ambitious. \u201cDisability representation in Hollywood is\u2026 really? I\u2019ll change that, why not? It\u2019s what I\u2019m aiming for. Because it filters down.\u201d She\u2019s already conquering British telly; you can\u2019t help but be convinced she\u2019ll get to Tinseltown, too. Because while in this film Madeley might only be playing an activist, the reality is she\u2019s also a change-maker. Barbara locked herself to buses; Madeley makes work that shifts the dial. There\u2019s no reason why both can\u2019t lead to the same result.</p> <p>\u201cI always thought I\u2019d go to the cinema one day and see a wheelchair user as the lead in a blockbuster,\u201d Madeley says. \u201cI never did. Still haven\u2019t. So one day, another little Ruth will go to the cinema and see me. That\u2019s the plan.\u201d </p> <p><em>Then Barbara Met Alan will be shown on BBC Two and iPlayer on 21 March at 9pm</em></p> <p><em>Stylist Hope Lawrie; photographer\u2019s assistant Joe Stone; makeup by James O\u2019Riley at Premier Hair and Makeup using MAC Cosmetics; hair by Tyler Johnston at One Represents using Oribe; nails by Jeanette Vuong at Hired Hands; shot at Shoreditch studios</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Ruth Madeley hadn\u2019t intended to cause a commotion in the quiet carriage. She was taking the train to a script read-through on an entirely unremarkable March 2016 morning when, out of the blue, her phone started to ping at an unusual pace. She gave apologetic looks to the commuters tutting at the incessant buzzing. But once she\u2019d looked down at the screen, she stopped caring what other people thought. \u201cI picked up my phone and read the first Twitter post,\u201d Madeley says. \u201cBafta nominations for Best Actress: Suranne Jones, Claire Foy, Sheridan Smith\u2026 and me. I couldn\u2019t shitting believe it.\u201d Nine months earlier, Don\u2019t Take My Baby, a drama about two disabled parents fighting to keep their newborn child, had been broadcast on BBC Three. It\u2019s been estimated that thousands of babies are removed from disabled couples annually in the UK; Madeley played one such mother fighting to keep her daughter. There\u2019d been talk on set about the production being something special and, when it first aired, it received an impressive reception. Still, when Madeley saw that notification from Bafta, she was gobsmacked. It was her first leading TV role. \u201cI pushed the phone away and just sat there breathing deeply,\u201d Madeley remembers. \u201cHoly shit. All these women I watched on TV and thought of as powerhouses. And I was in a category with them? It still feels ridiculous to me.\u201d Years might have passed, but Madeley still gets a thrill reliving that moment. When she retells the story, sitting in the glam room behind an east London studio, the 34-year-old actor breaks out into an ear-to-ear grin. Madeley was born with spina bifida and uses a wheelchair. When she began acting, she wanted to tell untold stories \u2013 to be successful, disabled and visible. To her, the nomination was confirmation she\u2019d been seen. \u201cDoing this has never just been about acting for me, and it never will be,\u201d she says. \u201cI know that with every role I do, there\u2019ll be disabled teenagers at home watching TV. I\u2019d never seen anyone like me, but maybe these ones could.\u201d We\u2019re meeting now to talk about Then Barbara Met Alan, Madeley\u2019s latest project. In it, she plays Barbara Lisicki, a pioneering disability rights campaigner. It follows Lisicki and her partner Alan Holdsworth (played by Arthur Hughes), who are cabaret performers and activists, in their efforts to see the passing of the 1995 Disability Discrimination Act. It\u2019s set in the early 90s when, far from being equal citizens, disabled people faced huge barriers in the workplace, often lived in poor-quality housing, had little access to accessible transport and few rights enshrined in law. \u201cIt\u2019s a love story first and foremost,\u201d Madeley says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not preachy or jumping on a soapbox to talk about disability policy. It\u2019s a badass way for disabled people to talk about how they had to fight for their rights to get that bill through parliament, and the legacy it left.\u201d Madeley was a child when the protests and riots were unfolding. In early adulthood, she began to learn a little more. \u201cIn my 20s, I researched them myself: watching documentaries, deep-diving into recent history.\u201d This project presented an opportunity to celebrate those heroes who sacrificed so much and put their bodies on the line. Naturally, Madeley says, she\u2019s a glass-half-full kind of person. \u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t have been,\u201d she explains, \u201cbut I was shocked at how much of what they were demanding we are still fighting for today.\u201d There are the practical things: so many disabled people still don\u2019t have access to public transport. \u201cBut the majority of barriers I face as a disabled person aren\u2019t physical,\u201d Madeley says. \u201cIn theory, transport is easy to get fixed if there\u2019s willing, but perceptions of what it means to be disabled are the biggest problem.\u201d You can\u2019t simply install a ramp to change people\u2019s minds. Just last year, a minicab driver refused to drop her outside Euston station\u2019s accessible entrance, stating that heavy traffic made it \u201ctoo difficult\u201d. He subsequently refused to return her wheelchair. When she reported the incident to the Metropolitan police, Madeley was told it wasn\u2019t a hate crime: \u201cI was shut down and made to feel as though I was making a fuss over nothing.\u201d It\u2019s why Madeley has no qualms, she explains, with being labelled a \u201cdisabled actor\u201d, or us spending time on the topic. She wants these conversations both to be had and heard. \u201cIt\u2019s why I feel in such a privileged and powerful position to be in the industry I\u2019m in,\u201d she says, with more than a hint of determination. \u201cIf you put disability at the forefront in the media and popular culture, you can change preconceptions of what disability is. That it\u2019s not a death sentence.\u201d For Madeley, it\u2019s more than just being present: \u201cIt means telling stories that change how people think.\u201d As childhoods go, much of Madeley\u2019s was blissfully ordinary. Mum was a nurse, Dad worked in customer services. Home was Bolton, where she still lives today, with her partner of nine years. But hospitals were a constant presence. Having been born with spina bifida \u2013 a condition that meant her spinal cord didn\u2019t develop fully in utero \u2013 trips to the doctor were part and parcel of daily life. \u201cWe always knew I\u2019d need surgery on my spine,\u201d Madeley explains. Her condition developed into neuromuscular scoliosis. \u201cBy the time I hit 11, we\u2019d started talking about a major corrective procedure where metal rods would be put into my back to straighten it.\u201d It was a lot for a young person to grapple with, but as much as possible Madeley didn\u2019t let it get to her. A year later, the surgeries started. \u201cIt was meant to be one operation,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it just kept going a bit pear shaped, and it ended up dragging on all the way through secondary school.\u201d In all, Madeley missed a year and a half of in-person education; she completed her GCSE coursework from a hospital bed. \u201cThe recovery process for any spinal surgery is boringly long,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m an incredibly impatient person. That healing kept getting delayed as things went wrong, so I felt I was wasting time.\u201d There were tough periods, but in the end, the procedures were successful. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t traumatic,\u201d she says, \u201cand honestly aside from that I had a great time: Take That, Spice Girls, Barbies. I was living the 90s dream.\u201d After leaving school, Madeley studied creative writing and English at Edge Hill University in Lancashire. She\u2019d contemplated being a vet and a fashion designer before settling on the idea of being a writer: both previous plans had been abandoned when Madeley accepted she wasn\u2019t particularly practical and didn\u2019t have the stomach to put down people\u2019s pets. \u201cI\u2019d always loved film and TV,\u201d Madeley says, \u201cand was very aware I never saw anyone like me in programmes. So, I thought, I\u2019ll write those characters instead.\u201d Just after graduation, Madeley landed herself a work placement with the BBC\u2019s script-editing team. It was interesting, but pretty quickly she added \u201cworking a 9-5 desk job\u201d to her list of \u201ccareer cannots\u201d. It was there, though, that Madeley met a producer who suggested she audition for a part in an episode of a CBBC drama on a whim. \u201cShe told me they were looking for a wheelchair user,\u201d says Madeley, \u201cand asked if I\u2019d go along.\u201d Other than her show-stealing performance as Mary in a primary school nativity, she\u2019d never considered acting. \u201cBut I\u2019m nosy, so I agreed.\u201d Mostly, Madeley was keen to understand the casting process. One day, she hoped, her own scripts would go through it. When asked where she\u2019d trained at the audition, Madeley shrugged and explained she just worked up the hallway. Turns out, she was a natural. Madeley bagged the part. \u201cI thought if I was lucky it could be a side hustle,\u201d she says. This was no everything-clicks-into-place revelatory moment. \u201cI saw it as a way to keep building contacts in the industry and while I don\u2019t want to say that I didn\u2019t think it was possible \u2013 I try to be one of those insufferable \u2018you can do anything\u2019 types \u2013 there really was nobody who looked like me making work on screen.\u201d Afterwards, Madeley took a job in fundraising for Whizz Kids, a charity that buys mobility equipment for disabled children; they\u2019d helped purchase her first wheelchair, aged five. Creativity took a backseat: bit parts popped up, occasionally; she wrote at the weekend. And then, the script for Don\u2019t Take My Baby landed on her desk. \u201cI knew right away I needed to do it,\u201d Madeley recalls, \u201cthat I would fight people in the street for it; I wasn\u2019t going to be gracious.\u201d Thankfully, none of that was necessary. Madeley, again, was cast. As breakout roles go, it was all-consuming. \u201cIt was hard, emotionally taxing,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not a mum, so I hadn\u2019t had the experience of having a child. Oh my God, I thought, if I have children, am I going to have the authorities knocking at my door? That was frightening.\u201d Meanwhile, she was learning on the job, petrified that production would pick up on her lack of leading lady experience. It made the Bafta nomination all the more reassuring when it came. The day after the ceremony, however, Madeley was back in the Whizz Kids office, hitting the phones to fundraise. \u201cI just assumed it would all be over after that,\u201d she says, \u201chonestly I still think that now. I never imagined there\u2019d be longevity.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just that having a regular paycheque was comforting. \u201cI was also scared there wouldn\u2019t be enough roles,\u201d she says. \u201cDisability did play into that. Still thinking I\u2019ll only get called when they need a disabled actress. The industry has underestimated disabled people for so long that it\u2019s no wonder that\u2019s how I felt.\u201d For the next three years, Madeley only moonlighted as an actor. When parts came along, she\u2019d use annual leave or make up the hours at nights or weekends. \u201cIt was only after I took a six-month unpaid sabbatical to film Russell T Davies\u2019s Years and Years,\u201d Madeley says, \u201cthat something shifted.\u201d On her first day back \u2013 having already been offered her next gig \u2013 Madeley had a word with her boss. \u201cWould you mind,\u201d she asked, earnestly, \u201cif I slightly extended my sabbatical?\u201d It would only be, she assured her manager, two months tops. \u201cI remember my boss said to me: \u2018Ruth, I think you\u2019re an actress now.\u2019 That\u2019s when it hit me. Maybe I am. Never had I been struck by so much fear.\u201d Much has changed for disabled actors, Madeley says, even since she stumbled into the industry. She counts herself lucky to have worked on projects where disability is at the forefront of the narrative, and others where it has barely played a part. She knows that hasn\u2019t always been the experience of others, both past and present. \u201cI know that for too long, and for lots of people, this was closed off,\u201d she says, \u201cthat actors would be told, explicitly, they\u2019ll only be seen for \u2018disabled\u2019 roles.\u201d Finding a balance, she believes, has proved important. There has been an impressive array of roles in the past six years, but this is the first time since Don\u2019t Take My Baby when a story about disability takes centre stage. \u201cFor so long, disabled actors were pigeonholed,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t want to lose those disabled stories, the ones we were only allowed to play before. Because we do need to tell them. But you want them told authentically, with disabled people in front of and behind the camera.\u201d This, she believes, is what When Barbara Met Alan achieves. \u201cIt\u2019s a cool, punk middle finger,\u201d she says, \u201cstrong and empowering, with disabled people at the helm.\u201d It\u2019s about far more than representation, Madeley reckons. The result sees the experiences of disabled people depicted in a way that others might not otherwise consider. How disabled bodies are seen and presented, she\u2019s clear, is an integral part. While making Don\u2019t Take My Baby, the day came where Madeley would have to shoot a shower scene. \u201cThey came in with my costume: two nipple covers and a pair of pants,\u201d she says. In retrospect it\u2019s all rather funny. \u201cBut back then I was totally petrified.\u201d She locked herself in the bathroom and phoned her sister, desperate to find an out. \u201cShe talked me down,\u201d Madeley says, still grateful, \u201ctelling me: \u2018You are doing this for 15-year-old you, and all the 15-year-old yous out there now. Who never see their bodies, their scars.\u201d Once they\u2019d wrapped for the day? \u201cIt was the best feeling in the world.\u201d The sex scene in Then Barbara Met Alan felt just as liberating. \u201cAfter we shot it,\u201d Madeley says, \u201cone of our directors stopped us and said we needed to take a moment to talk about it. I don\u2019t think it had been done before: two visibly disabled characters, played by two disabled actors, in a loving \u2013 and sexy \u2013 sex scene.\u201d For all present, it felt like a milestone. Spending time with Madeley leaves you in no doubt there\u2019ll be many more to come. Because, already, there\u2019s plenty in the pipeline, both her own projects and other acting jobs. She\u2019d love to tell me about them, she assures me, beaming, but sadly can\u2019t. And in the long term? \u201cHollywood, please,\u201d Madeley says, not skipping a beat, unashamedly ambitious. \u201cDisability representation in Hollywood is\u2026 really?

Still haven\u2019t. So one day, another little Ruth will go to the cinema and see me. That\u2019s the plan.\u201d Then Barbara Met Alan will be shown on BBC Two and iPlayer on 21 March at 9pm Stylist Hope Lawrie; photographer\u2019s assistant Joe Stone; makeup by James O\u2019Riley at Premier Hair and Makeup using MAC Cosmetics; hair by Tyler Johnston at One Represents using Oribe; nails by Jeanette Vuong at Hired Hands; shot at Shoreditch studios",

      "body": "<p>The Balkan condiment ajvar is made of roasted, pureed red peppers. It is the sticky centre of Kosovan writer-director Blerta Basholli\u2019s feminist drama, based on a true story, about an enterprising single mother in the strictly patriarchal village of Krush\u00eb e Madhe whose decision to start her own ajvar business has everyone talking.</p> <p>Basholli\u2019s agile handheld camera aligns itself with the steely Fahrije (Yllka Gashi), hovering close by as she anticipates her husband\u2019s return from the Kosovan war. \u201cIf he ever comes back, he will understand,\u201d she tells her naysayers. Deep down, she knows that the chances of his homecoming are heartbreakingly slim. Disapproving men throw stones at her car, but the local women, who also await their missing men, rally around (the straight-talking Nazmije, played by Kumrije Hoxha, is a particular highlight). Soon, Fahrije\u2019s home becomes a hub or, rather, a hive, buzzing with joy, connection and purpose. Basholli understands that healing is possible, even if closure isn\u2019t.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGx8RsQO4Bk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gGx8RsQO4Bk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGx8RsQO4Bk\">Watch a trailer for Hive.</a></figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "The Balkan condiment ajvar is made of roasted, pureed red peppers. It is the sticky centre of Kosovan writer-director Blerta Basholli\u2019s feminist drama, based on a true story, about an enterprising single mother in the strictly patriarchal village of Krush\u00eb e Madhe whose decision to start her own ajvar business has everyone talking. Basholli\u2019s agile handheld camera aligns itself with the steely Fahrije (Yllka Gashi), hovering close by as she anticipates her husband\u2019s return from the Kosovan war. \u201cIf he ever comes back, he will understand,\u201d she tells her naysayers. Deep down, she knows that the chances of his homecoming are heartbreakingly slim. Disapproving men throw stones at her car, but the local women, who also await their missing men, rally around (the straight-talking Nazmije, played by Kumrije Hoxha, is a particular highlight). Soon, Fahrije\u2019s home becomes a hub or, rather, a hive, buzzing with joy, connection and purpose. Basholli understands that healing is possible, even if closure isn\u2019t.",

We tried it out on a few locations and it suggested some great-looking growers including <a href=\"http://www.londonflowerfarmer.co.uk/\">the London Flower Farmer</a> in Walthamstow, east London, <a href=\"https://www.clemsgarden.co.uk/\">Clem\u2019s Garden</a>, a social enterprise based in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, and <a href=\"https://www.flowersfromthefarm.co.uk/members/flowers-at-forty-hall-farm/\">Flowers at Forty Hall Farm</a> in Enfield, north London.</p> <p>With some of the UK growers, bear in mind that as it is still March, it may be a little early in the season for them, so you may have to try elsewhere for this coming Mother\u2019s Day.</p> <p>Clare Cook runs <a href=\"https://www.theflowerproject.uk/\">the Flower Project</a>, a small independent florist in Cambridge, and delivers all her flowers and house plants locally by bicycle. She says she often receives online and telephone orders from customers outside Cambridge who want to send flowers or plants to someone who lives in her delivery area. Prices start at \u00a335 for a medium-sized seasonal bouquet of tulips, alstroemeria, narcissi and hyacinths, and she charges \u00a33.75 for delivery.</p> <p>\u201cSupporting an independent local business is really important, especially at the moment,\u201d Cook says. \u201cA lot of independent florists use other local businesses as well, so it creates that chain effect.\u201d The money goes into the local economy and the local community of the person you are buying flowers for: \u201cYou\u2019re not just supporting me, you\u2019re supporting a whole ecosystem.\u201d</p> <p>She thinks local florists also provide a more personal service: \u201cI think you get a better selection and different varieties, and if you spoke to your local florist, you could probably get a bouquet that\u2019s more custom-designed or special.\u201d</p> <p>Cook tries to ensure her flowers are environmentally friendly by buying from local farmers and making deliveries by bicycle, and says a big advantage of using a local florist is that the person who makes up the bouquet is often the person who delivers the flowers to the recipient\u2019s door. \u201cYou\u2019re not going through a big courier like DPD. So if anything goes wrong, we know what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f9f74242c04c00ca965ec79904ffefc98042038\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f9f74242c04c00ca965ec79904ffefc98042038/46_0_5965_3703/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Flower Project in Cambridge gets puts deliveries in a bike ready to go out \" width=\"1000\" height=\"621\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Flower Project in Cambridge delivers flowers and house plants locally by bicycle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Eales for Indie Cambridge</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.interflora.co.uk/\">Interflora</a> is the best-known network of local florists (it works with about 900 in the UK and Ireland), although other players have muscled into this space \u2013 notably <a href=\"https://www.floom.com/\">Floom</a>, which launched in 2016.</p> <p>Cook says that if you place an order directly with the local florist, as opposed to using a brand such as Interflora, all the money goes to the florist..</p> <h2><strong>Consider </strong><strong>\u2018letterbox flowers</strong><strong>\u2019</strong></h2> <p>If you want your flowers to be a surprise and are not sure when your chosen recipient will be home to accept delivery, consider sending \u201cletterbox flowers\u201d. With this option, a bouquet is posted \u2013 often via Royal Mail \u2013 in a long cardboard box that can typically fit easily through a letterbox.</p> <p>Bloom &amp; Wild pioneered this method of delivery, and Gelbard says it offers particularly good value for money for consumers. \u201cWe are able to offer our best prices on letterbox bouquets. They cost a bit less to produce because we don\u2019t have to hand-tie them in our studio, and their box and packaging costs are smaller.\u201d Prices start at \u00a322, including delivery, for 12 British tulips. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec04ba1588cf7393610ad0cae3a785d87f105f41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec04ba1588cf7393610ad0cae3a785d87f105f41/18_0_6668_4474/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bloom & Wild flowers in a box\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bloom &amp; Wild says letterbox flowers \u2018cost a bit less to produce\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloom &amp; Wild</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Choose multi</strong><strong>stemmed blooms</strong></h2> <p>In general, if you want to maximise value for money, it\u2019s a good idea to opt for a multistemmed flower.</p> <p>\u201cA multistemmed flower is going to have more heads on it, and then when they open, it really fills the vase,\u201d says Dani Turner, a spokesperson for the online florists <a href=\"https://www.bunches.co.uk/\">Bunches</a>. She particularly recommends chrysanthemums and spray carnations, which are usually cheaper than roses and often last longer.</p> <p>Another tip is to look for a bouquet with a good range of different flowers and foliage, as this can also give a bouquet volume. Gelbard says: \u201cFreesias stick out sideways and help create a sense of width.\u201d </p> <h2><strong>Take out a subscription</strong></h2> <p>One growth area is flower subscription services. Many florists offer these, although what you get and how much it costs varies greatly.</p> <p>Bloom &amp; Wild offers a range of subscriptions you can buy for yourself or as a gift. For \u00a370 you can get three bouquets delivered over the next three months (so \u00a323.33 a bouquet). <a href=\"https://www.freddiesflowers.com/\">Freddie\u2019s Flowers</a> delivers regular boxes of blooms to people\u2019s doors. The standard price is \u00a325 a box, although you will find offers and codes online. Other firms doing subscriptions include the London florist Appleyard.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"af8bf8a9f9dc376dcb674de1d7c1e309d223a199\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af8bf8a9f9dc376dcb674de1d7c1e309d223a199/13_0_2018_2048/985.jpg\" alt=\"Love Delivered flowers.\" width=\"985\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Love Delivered has taken steps to reduce the impact on the environment of growing flowers commercially in the UK.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Taran Thompson/Matte Black Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, Interflora sells annual delivery passes. For \u00a312 a year you get unlimited, free next-day delivery for a year.</p> <h2><strong>Look for cashback offers and discount codes</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s often possible to get cashback when you make purchases from flower retailers at this time of year, and then use a discount code on top to reduce the price even further.</p> <p>At the time of writing, Santander and Lloyds current account holders could get up to 15% cashback on purchases made with their debit cards at <a href=\"https://www.flyingflowers.co.uk/\">Flying Flowers</a> by activating this specific reward on their account. Prices at Flying Flowers start at \u00a319.99 for a bouquet of 12 mixed alstroemeria, including delivery by post, and you can include free Lindor milk chocolates with the code FREECHOCS.</p> <p>Cashback websites also currently have some good offers available. Quidco was this week offering between 13.5% and 18% cashback at Eflorist, and between 11.25% and 20% cashback at Bloom &amp; Wild, depending on what you order and the delivery date.</p> <p>TopCashback is offering all members 25% cashback at Bloom &amp; Wild on Tuesday 22 March, and if you are new to the site, you can claim \u00a310 cashback on top of that.</p> <p>To find a discount code, Google the name of the retailer you would like to buy from and the words \u201cdiscount code\u201d or \u201cvoucher code\u201d to see what comes up. At the time of writing, there is a good selection of codes available on websites such as vouchercloud and VoucherCodes.</p> <p>Many of the big flower retailers Guardian Money spoke to have also provided discount codes for Guardian readers. The discount code Mum10 will give you a 10% discount at Love Delivered until 25 March, while Guardian20 will give you a 20% discount on most purchases at Bloom &amp; Wild and Bunches.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec04ba1588cf7393610ad0cae3a785d87f105f41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec04ba1588cf7393610ad0cae3a785d87f105f41/18_0_6668_4474/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bloom & Wild\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bloom &amp; Wild is among the online florists offering discounts to Guardian Money readers. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloom &amp; Wild</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>What if there\u2019s a problem?</strong></h2> <p>\u201cIf your flowers arrive in a sorrowful state, such as wilting or with browning petals or leaves, they are not of satisfactory quality and you should be entitled to a refund,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/advice/i-m-unhappy-with-flowers-bought-online-what-are-my-rights-aBs4Q8H4tf4W\">says the consumer organisation Which?</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is likely the retailer will only discuss, rectify or refund an order with the person who made the purchase</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Adam French, a consumer rights expert at the body, says: \u201cTake a photo of the flowers upon arrival, and grab a picture and description of the flowers from the retailer\u2019s website as well if you can \u2013 as this evidence will be helpful when lodging your complaint.\u201d</p> <p>If the flowers were a gift, speak to the person who sent them and let them know you think they have been let down by the retailer, he adds. It is likely the retailer will only discuss, rectify or refund an order with the person who made the purchase.</p> <h2><strong>\u2026 </strong><strong>Or buy a plant?</strong></h2> <p>Instead of buying flowers on Mother\u2019s Day, why not get a gift that is more sustainable and will last longer?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always found it strange that we celebrate the important people in our lives by giving them cut flowers \u2013 dead flowers that might last a matter of days, leaving a puddle of browning water and a stained vase behind them,\u201d Stephen Folwell says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f34c6eb49861f50a2880d9b34de8a14523ed6a1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f34c6eb49861f50a2880d9b34de8a14523ed6a1a/1474_0_5743_5489/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plants on sale at the Flower Project, Cambridge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"956\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plants on sale at the Flower Project, Cambridge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Eales for Indie Cambridge</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His company, <a href=\"https://www.muddytrowel.com/\">Muddy Trowel</a>, works with British nurseries and growers to create plant kits that can be delivered in three to five working days. Each kit consists of seasonal flowers and plants, planted loosely in a pot, with a separate bag of soil for planting them properly in a pot outside so that they last until at least autumn. Prices start at \u00a315 for a Japanese alpine cherry planted in a 23cm wide pot, plus \u00a35 delivery.</p> <p>Alternatively, the website <a href=\"https://plants4presents.co.uk/\">Plants4Presents</a> has a wide range of house plants it promises it can deliver on Mother\u2019s Day. Prices start at \u00a322 for a colourful gerbera, and a pot and card are included. Delivery by DPD courier normally costs \u00a36 \u2013 but on Mother\u2019s Day this rises to \u00a311.</p> <p>If you want an \u201calmost unkillable\u201d houseplant to send to someone by post, there is a good range for sale on the website of <a href=\"https://www.patchplants.com/gb/en/\">Patch</a>, a plants and gardening firm, with prices starting at \u00a312 for a snake plant. However, you must spend at least \u00a325 to be able to check out, and delivery costs \u00a35 on Mother\u2019s Day.</p> <p>Bear in mind that a local florist is likely to sell plants, too, and should be able to provide advice on how to look after the plant and, for example, the size of pot it will need. \u201cWhen you phone an independent shop, they can give you all their knowledge and expertise,\u201d Cook says. All her plants are British-grown and bought locally in Cambridgeshire or Lincolnshire. \u201cPlants are a nice gift to give because they can last indefinitely,\u201d she says, \u201cas long as they\u2019re well looked-after\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Best buds: which florists are top rated?</strong></h2> <p>When you look at which florists and delivery firms are rated the best by the likes of the ethical comparison website <a href=\"https://thegoodshoppingguide.com/\">The Good Shopping Guide</a> and the big-selling lifestyle magazines, there are some names that keep popping up.</p> <p><strong>Arena Flowers</strong> is joint top (along with <strong>Prestige Flowers</strong>) of The Good Shopping Guide\u2019s <a href=\"https://thegoodshoppingguide.com/subject/ethical-flower-delivery-companies/\">ethical rating table</a>, and is also number one in BBC<strong> </strong>Gardeners\u2019 World Magazine\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gardenersworld.com/product-guides/accessories/best-online-flower-delivery/\">latest list of the best online flower delivery services</a>.

Buy seasonal flowers For those keen to buy blooms when they are in season, at the moment Annabel Lamb recommends opting for classic British springtime flowers such as tulips, hyacinths, irises, scented narcissi and daffodils: \u201cThey are our British beauties.\u201d Lamb and her family have been growing flowers in Lincolnshire for 40 years. Just over a year ago she decided to start selling the farm\u2019s own produce directly to the public, and set up an online nationwide delivery service for her flowers called Love Delivered. All the flowers sold on it are grown in Britain, either at Lamb\u2019s nurseries or those of a smaller British grower, and are hand-picked the same morning they are sent out. Cutting out intermediaries enables the family-run farm to keep its costs down. She has also taken steps to reduce the impact on the environment of growing flowers commercially in the UK: her nurseries are heated by biomass and irrigated with rainwater collected from gutters and stored in reservoirs. \u201cIt\u2019s all ethically done.

The cost of next-day, timed DPD courier delivery on a weekday is included in those prices but if you want delivery on Mother\u2019s Day itself, expect to pay an extra \u00a35. At the budget end of the spectrum, many of the big supermarkets, including Waitrose, Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s, are currently selling small bunches of UK-grown daffodils for only \u00a31 a pop. These will often have been grown in Cornwall. Give it a few weeks and the UK\u2019s tulip season will be in full swing in many locations. Buy local Instead of buying flowers from a nationwide company online, you may wish to use a local florist or grower. Many people will have a local florist they already use regularly or wish to support, although these may not always deliver to someone who lives some way away. A good website to try for locally grown British blooms is that of Flowers from the Farm, a membership association for cut flower growers in the UK. It has members from Cornwall to the Scottish Highlands, and its website lets you key in your town or postcode to find the nearest flower growers to you. We tried it out on a few locations and it suggested some great-looking growers including the London Flower Farmer in Walthamstow, east London, Clem\u2019s Garden, a social enterprise based in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, and Flowers at Forty Hall Farm in Enfield, north London. With some of the UK growers, bear in mind that as it is still March, it may be a little early in the season for them, so you may have to try elsewhere for this coming Mother\u2019s Day. Clare Cook runs the Flower Project, a small independent florist in Cambridge, and delivers all her flowers and house plants locally by bicycle. She says she often receives online and telephone orders from customers outside Cambridge who want to send flowers or plants to someone who lives in her delivery area. Prices start at \u00a335 for a medium-sized seasonal bouquet of tulips, alstroemeria, narcissi and hyacinths, and she charges \u00a33.75 for delivery. \u201cSupporting an independent local business is really important, especially at the moment,\u201d Cook says. \u201cA lot of independent florists use other local businesses as well, so it creates that chain effect.\u201d The money goes into the local economy and the local community of the person you are buying flowers for: \u201cYou\u2019re not just supporting me, you\u2019re supporting a whole ecosystem.\u201d She thinks local florists also provide a more personal service: \u201cI think you get a better selection and different varieties, and if you spoke to your local florist, you could probably get a bouquet that\u2019s more custom-designed or special.\u201d Cook tries to ensure her flowers are environmentally friendly by buying from local farmers and making deliveries by bicycle, and says a big advantage of using a local florist is that the person who makes up the bouquet is often the person who delivers the flowers to the recipient\u2019s door. \u201cYou\u2019re not going through a big courier like DPD. So if anything goes wrong, we know what\u2019s happened.\u201d Interflora is the best-known network of local florists (it works with about 900 in the UK and Ireland), although other players have muscled into this space \u2013 notably Floom, which launched in 2016. Cook says that if you place an order directly with the local florist, as opposed to using a brand such as Interflora, all the money goes to the florist.. Consider \u2018letterbox flowers\u2019 If you want your flowers to be a surprise and are not sure when your chosen recipient will be home to accept delivery, consider sending \u201cletterbox flowers\u201d. With this option, a bouquet is posted \u2013 often via Royal Mail \u2013 in a long cardboard box that can typically fit easily through a letterbox. Bloom &amp; Wild pioneered this method of delivery, and Gelbard says it offers particularly good value for money for consumers. \u201cWe are able to offer our best prices on letterbox bouquets. They cost a bit less to produce because we don\u2019t have to hand-tie them in our studio, and their box and packaging costs are smaller.\u201d Prices start at \u00a322, including delivery, for 12 British tulips. Choose multistemmed blooms In general, if you want to maximise value for money, it\u2019s a good idea to opt for a multistemmed flower. \u201cA multistemmed flower is going to have more heads on it, and then when they open, it really fills the vase,\u201d says Dani Turner, a spokesperson for the online florists Bunches. She particularly recommends chrysanthemums and spray carnations, which are usually cheaper than roses and often last longer. Another tip is to look for a bouquet with a good range of different flowers and foliage, as this can also give a bouquet volume. Gelbard says: \u201cFreesias stick out sideways and help create a sense of width.\u201d Take out a subscription One growth area is flower subscription services. Many florists offer these, although what you get and how much it costs varies greatly. Bloom &amp; Wild offers a range of subscriptions you can buy for yourself or as a gift. For \u00a370 you can get three bouquets delivered over the next three months (so \u00a323.33 a bouquet). Freddie\u2019s Flowers delivers regular boxes of blooms to people\u2019s doors. The standard price is \u00a325 a box, although you will find offers and codes online. Other firms doing subscriptions include the London florist Appleyard. Meanwhile, Interflora sells annual delivery passes. For \u00a312 a year you get unlimited, free next-day delivery for a year. Look for cashback offers and discount codes It\u2019s often possible to get cashback when you make purchases from flower retailers at this time of year, and then use a discount code on top to reduce the price even further. At the time of writing, Santander and Lloyds current account holders could get up to 15% cashback on purchases made with their debit cards at Flying Flowers by activating this specific reward on their account. Prices at Flying Flowers start at \u00a319.99 for a bouquet of 12 mixed alstroemeria, including delivery by post, and you can include free Lindor milk chocolates with the code FREECHOCS. Cashback websites also currently have some good offers available. Quidco was this week offering between 13.5% and 18% cashback at Eflorist, and between 11.25% and 20% cashback at Bloom &amp; Wild, depending on what you order and the delivery date. TopCashback is offering all members 25% cashback at Bloom &amp; Wild on Tuesday 22 March, and if you are new to the site, you can claim \u00a310 cashback on top of that. To find a discount code, Google the name of the retailer you would like to buy from and the words \u201cdiscount code\u201d or \u201cvoucher code\u201d to see what comes up. At the time of writing, there is a good selection of codes available on websites such as vouchercloud and VoucherCodes. Many of the big flower retailers Guardian Money spoke to have also provided discount codes for Guardian readers. The discount code Mum10 will give you a 10% discount at Love Delivered until 25 March, while Guardian20 will give you a 20% discount on most purchases at Bloom &amp; Wild and Bunches. What if there\u2019s a problem? \u201cIf your flowers arrive in a sorrowful state, such as wilting or with browning petals or leaves, they are not of satisfactory quality and you should be entitled to a refund,\u201d says the consumer organisation Which?. Adam French, a consumer rights expert at the body, says: \u201cTake a photo of the flowers upon arrival, and grab a picture and description of the flowers from the retailer\u2019s website as well if you can \u2013 as this evidence will be helpful when lodging your complaint.\u201d If the flowers were a gift, speak to the person who sent them and let them know you think they have been let down by the retailer, he adds. It is likely the retailer will only discuss, rectify or refund an order with the person who made the purchase. \u2026 Or buy a plant? Instead of buying flowers on Mother\u2019s Day, why not get a gift that is more sustainable and will last longer? \u201cI\u2019ve always found it strange that we celebrate the important people in our lives by giving them cut flowers \u2013 dead flowers that might last a matter of days, leaving a puddle of browning water and a stained vase behind them,\u201d Stephen Folwell says. His company, Muddy Trowel, works with British nurseries and growers to create plant kits that can be delivered in three to five working days. Each kit consists of seasonal flowers and plants, planted loosely in a pot, with a separate bag of soil for planting them properly in a pot outside so that they last until at least autumn. Prices start at \u00a315 for a Japanese alpine cherry planted in a 23cm wide pot, plus \u00a35 delivery. Alternatively, the website Plants4Presents has a wide range of house plants it promises it can deliver on Mother\u2019s Day. Prices start at \u00a322 for a colourful gerbera, and a pot and card are included. Delivery by DPD courier normally costs \u00a36 \u2013 but on Mother\u2019s Day this rises to \u00a311. If you want an \u201calmost unkillable\u201d houseplant to send to someone by post, there is a good range for sale on the website of Patch, a plants and gardening firm, with prices starting at \u00a312 for a snake plant. However, you must spend at least \u00a325 to be able to check out, and delivery costs \u00a35 on Mother\u2019s Day. Bear in mind that a local florist is likely to sell plants, too, and should be able to provide advice on how to look after the plant and, for example, the size of pot it will need. \u201cWhen you phone an independent shop, they can give you all their knowledge and expertise,\u201d Cook says. All her plants are British-grown and bought locally in Cambridgeshire or Lincolnshire. \u201cPlants are a nice gift to give because they can last indefinitely,\u201d she says, \u201cas long as they\u2019re well looked-after\u201d. Best buds: which florists are top rated? When you look at which florists and delivery firms are rated the best by the likes of the ethical comparison website The Good Shopping Guide and the big-selling lifestyle magazines, there are some names that keep popping up. Arena Flowers is joint top (along with Prestige Flowers) of The Good Shopping Guide\u2019s ethical rating table, and is also number one in BBC Gardeners\u2019 World Magazine\u2019s latest list of the best online flower delivery services. Arena Flowers claims to be \u201cthe UK\u2019s most ethical florist\u201d and was also recently named \u201cbest for socially-conscious shopping\u201d by Good Housekeeping. In second and third place respectively on the Gardeners\u2019 World list are Bunches and Bloom &amp; Wild. The latter was named best flower delivery service by Good Housekeeping, while the publication named the former as best for next-day delivery, and Prestige Flowers as best for supporting charities. Last year Which? did a pre-Mother\u2019s Day quality test and said its two top picks were The Great British Florist and Marks &amp; Spencer.",

      "body": "<p>Before the pandemic hit, I had read that the future of higher education would involve a shift from the university as a physical location of learning to a digital offering that came to you, wherever you were. I remember thinking: well, that will never happen! Even with the popularity of distance learning and digital education platforms to support in-person learning, I couldn\u2019t imagine a world in which the campus didn\u2019t feature as the hub of resources, networking and socialising. Yet that was exactly the world the pandemic brought us.</p> <p>In September 2020, my colleagues at Brunel University London and I lamented (over a video call) how hard the coming term was going to be, how our students were losing out, how our teaching wouldn\u2019t translate online. The main pedagogy of my subject, creative writing, is the writing workshop, by which students read and offer feedback on each other\u2019s work. For students new to this discipline, being in a room together, engaging in what can be a nerve-racking activity, felt very important. No online version could replace real human connection, surely?</p> <p>University is not just a place where teaching and learning happens \u2013 it is where young people transition from teenage to adult life, where they feed themselves, do their own laundry, manage their money, find their adult friendship groups. It is where they learn to take charge of their lives.</p> <p>This was my experience of university, 25 years ago.

      "bodyText": "Before the pandemic hit, I had read that the future of higher education would involve a shift from the university as a physical location of learning to a digital offering that came to you, wherever you were. I remember thinking: well, that will never happen! Even with the popularity of distance learning and digital education platforms to support in-person learning, I couldn\u2019t imagine a world in which the campus didn\u2019t feature as the hub of resources, networking and socialising. Yet that was exactly the world the pandemic brought us. In September 2020, my colleagues at Brunel University London and I lamented (over a video call) how hard the coming term was going to be, how our students were losing out, how our teaching wouldn\u2019t translate online. The main pedagogy of my subject, creative writing, is the writing workshop, by which students read and offer feedback on each other\u2019s work. For students new to this discipline, being in a room together, engaging in what can be a nerve-racking activity, felt very important. No online version could replace real human connection, surely? University is not just a place where teaching and learning happens \u2013 it is where young people transition from teenage to adult life, where they feed themselves, do their own laundry, manage their money, find their adult friendship groups. It is where they learn to take charge of their lives. This was my experience of university, 25 years ago. But, at Brunel, many of the students were already having very different experiences from mine. Some lived at home and commuted across London to classes. Some balanced studying with part-time or not-so-part-time work. Crucially, most had a sophisticated digital literacy, which, in some ways, meant they were far more prepared for online learning than I was. Here are some of the things that happened in the past two years. Student attendance improved \u2013 in some cases, significantly. With no commute to face, more students logged in to classes \u2013 often, I suspect, from bed. Why don\u2019t I know whether or not they were in bed? Because, in the first weeks, many kept their cameras off \u2013 until my team decided that talking into an abyss of black screens was awful and introduced a \u201ccameras on\u201d policy. The chat function in Zoom is an interesting place \u2013 students who might be shy to talk in class might not be shy in chat. Sometimes, I struggled to keep up with the speed of their responses. My day became full of new language: \u201cLet\u2019s Zoom\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ll just screen-share\u201d, \u201cSee you on Teams!\u201d On good days, I had 40 students attending fruitful online discussions, giving many responses to my questions and sensitive feedback about each other\u2019s work.

At the time, neither of us knew much about the sport. The British driver Lewis Hamilton had crossed over into mainstream celebrity. But who was he racing? Who ran their teams and made their cars? Where did they compete? The details, beyond the obvious ones \u2013 that there is a famous circuit in Monaco, that there is a team owned by Ferrari \u2013 escaped me. It seemed distant and alien \u2013 a circus going on far away.</p> <p>At the time, this was a common experience. Formula One may be a major sport but it has often struggled for a broad audience. But <em>Drive to Survive</em>, which transforms the twists and turns of a regular season into captivating melodrama, and makes heroes and villains out of its drivers and team owners, many of whom seem made for screen, has shifted public perception. In this dramatised version, F1 becomes less about the cars and more about the men who drive them: not just their egos and terrible ambition, but the tangled issues of contract disputes and parts partnerships and race-day bust-ups and of billionaire owners installing their offspring in coveted driving seats.</p> <p>What could have been a buttoned-up docuseries about technical precision instead became an examination of the sloppier aspects of the human condition. Rage, disloyalty, jealousy, striving \u2013 it\u2019s all there. In its first season, which aired in 2019, the show\u2019s producers failed to gain access to Mercedes and Ferrari, F1\u2019s leading teams. No bother. Instead, they created stories out of the enterprise of lesser competitors \u2013 the little-known teams battling for scraps \u2013 which turned out to offer its own, no less exhilarating kind of television.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d3f42de74cfed142605f013e2f836d9ad6d65a9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3f42de74cfed142605f013e2f836d9ad6d65a9e/120_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christian Horner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christian Horner, Red Bull team boss.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Part of <em>Drive to Survive</em>\u2019s success lies in its use of its given cast \u2013 the people, most of them men, that make up the sport.

Of course not. Though in one new episode viewers watch him ogle a live-feed of Hamilton and mutter: \u201cCan\u2019t he shut the fuck up?\u201d</p> <p><em>Drive to Survive</em>\u2019s fourth season, which follows the ups and downs of 2021\u2019s racing, was released on Netflix in the past couple of weeks, and has been eagerly anticipated, not least because this past season was a humdinger. At the time of writing, five days after it came out, viewers had already screened 28 million hours of the new series, according to Netflix, and within a week it had become one of service\u2019s top 10 TV shows in 50 countries, including the UK and Ukraine.</p> <p>The show\u2019s success has had knock-on effects for Formula One itself. In 2021, the sport\u2019s cumulative <a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.formula-1-announces-tv-race-attendance-and-digital-audience-figures-for-2021.1YDpVJIOHGNuok907sWcKW.html#:~:text=Globally%2C%20the%20average%20audience%20per,the%20highest%20figure%20since%202013.\" title=\"\">TV audience was up 4%</a> from the previous year, reaching 1.55 billion.

(That\u2019s a 29% increase on 2020\u2019s equivalent.) My son and I watched that race \u2013 the actual race, not a heavily dramatised Netflix version of it, though we will watch that as well. Until that point, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever watched an entire grand prix from start to finish.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e62c9d2a6957026d4cdef95097399734f8c7068a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e62c9d2a6957026d4cdef95097399734f8c7068a/120_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton will be hoping to regain his world title after losing it in the final race of the 2021 season to Max Verstappen of Red Bull.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 2021 finale prompted questions about the uneasy marriage between professional sport and its broadcast partners, including Netflix. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2021/dec/12/f1-abu-dhabi-grand-prix-formula-one-max-verstappen-lewis-hamilton-title-live-updates\" title=\"\">Controversial decisions were made mid-race</a>, live on television, creating tension that is still simmering now. At the time, not a few people wondered if those decisions had been made for the benefit of the drivers or the viewers, many of whom were new to the sport and expecting from live races similar levels of drama created by Netflix\u2019s editors. Fans were right to ask: what is real, and what is constructed?</p> <p>In a recent interview, Toto Wolff, team principal at Mercedes, said of Netflix: \u201cIt\u2019s scary how much we let them in,\u201d adding, \u201cThey create a spin to the narrative. They put scenes together that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Verstappen has refused to give further interviews to the series\u2019 producers, questioning their integrity. (\u201cIt\u2019s just not my thing, faking rivalries,\u201d he said recently.) A few days ago, the British driver <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/16/lando-norris-now-i-need-to-show-i-can-go-up-against-lewis-and-max\" title=\"\">Lando Norris </a>worried that audio recordings from one 2021 race had been paired with action from another, creating a false narrative. Sometimes you wonder whether the drivers signed up to the distraction of having cameras invade their personal and professional spaces so brazenly (reportedly, F1 went to Netflix with the show\u2019s original idea). Though even Norris is susceptible to the series\u2019 charm. \u201cThere are things which may be a bit too much,\u201d he said. \u201cBut on the whole, it think it\u2019s just exciting.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77a8d29e6d4fc70537bed4369fc1a22f3d71feba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77a8d29e6d4fc70537bed4369fc1a22f3d71feba/120_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Formula One race\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Drive to Survive aims to bring grand prix racing to a wider audience, as \u2018F1 becomes less about the cars and more about the men who drive them\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But is any of this terrible for F1? Not all viewers think so. Even the show\u2019s mishandling of the sport\u2019s reaction to the BLM movement \u2013 a few minutes of race-related footage tagged on to one episode \u2013 didn\u2019t seem to dent new interest. In the aftermath of the 2021 season, one tweet read: \u201cBetter to be a controversial sport than a boring one.\u201d In the first episode of season four, F1\u2019s CEO Stefano Domenicali announces: \u201cI have the duty to maximise the value of Formula One,\u201d in a tone that suggests he will do anything to make that happen, Netflix docuseries being just the beginning.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/13/six-things-that-will-change-in-formula-one-this-season\">F1 2022: six things to look forward to in the new season</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When we started watching <em>Drive to Survive</em>, my son was three, too young to pick up on the details, I thought. Because the characters of Formula One swear liberally and sometimes completely out of the blue, episodes often played in the background, on mute. But soon I realised that he, too, had become caught up in the drama. Whenever we went out in our sensible family car, he would expect us to reach impressive and illegal speeds. I remember him once making reference to Daniel Ricciardo, a charming Australian driver who features heavily in the first series. \u201cWe\u2019re Ricciardo, Dad,\u201d he said, while we were driving down an A-road at the legal limit. And then, pointing to a car in front of us: \u201cThat\u2019s Leclerc. Catch him!\u201d It was an example of how F1 had infiltrated our life. In the end we did catch him \u2013 not Charles Leclerc, the Ferrari driver, but a middle-aged woman, her own kids in the back \u2013 and as we drove away my son seemed pleased.

(That\u2019s a 29% increase on 2020\u2019s equivalent.) My son and I watched that race \u2013 the actual race, not a heavily dramatised Netflix version of it, though we will watch that as well. Until that point, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever watched an entire grand prix from start to finish. The 2021 finale prompted questions about the uneasy marriage between professional sport and its broadcast partners, including Netflix. Controversial decisions were made mid-race, live on television, creating tension that is still simmering now. At the time, not a few people wondered if those decisions had been made for the benefit of the drivers or the viewers, many of whom were new to the sport and expecting from live races similar levels of drama created by Netflix\u2019s editors. Fans were right to ask: what is real, and what is constructed? In a recent interview, Toto Wolff, team principal at Mercedes, said of Netflix: \u201cIt\u2019s scary how much we let them in,\u201d adding, \u201cThey create a spin to the narrative. They put scenes together that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Verstappen has refused to give further interviews to the series\u2019 producers, questioning their integrity. (\u201cIt\u2019s just not my thing, faking rivalries,\u201d he said recently.) A few days ago, the British driver Lando Norris worried that audio recordings from one 2021 race had been paired with action from another, creating a false narrative. Sometimes you wonder whether the drivers signed up to the distraction of having cameras invade their personal and professional spaces so brazenly (reportedly, F1 went to Netflix with the show\u2019s original idea). Though even Norris is susceptible to the series\u2019 charm. \u201cThere are things which may be a bit too much,\u201d he said. \u201cBut on the whole, it think it\u2019s just exciting.\u201d But is any of this terrible for F1? Not all viewers think so. Even the show\u2019s mishandling of the sport\u2019s reaction to the BLM movement \u2013 a few minutes of race-related footage tagged on to one episode \u2013 didn\u2019t seem to dent new interest. In the aftermath of the 2021 season, one tweet read: \u201cBetter to be a controversial sport than a boring one.\u201d In the first episode of season four, F1\u2019s CEO Stefano Domenicali announces: \u201cI have the duty to maximise the value of Formula One,\u201d in a tone that suggests he will do anything to make that happen, Netflix docuseries being just the beginning. When we started watching Drive to Survive, my son was three, too young to pick up on the details, I thought. Because the characters of Formula One swear liberally and sometimes completely out of the blue, episodes often played in the background, on mute. But soon I realised that he, too, had become caught up in the drama. Whenever we went out in our sensible family car, he would expect us to reach impressive and illegal speeds. I remember him once making reference to Daniel Ricciardo, a charming Australian driver who features heavily in the first series. \u201cWe\u2019re Ricciardo, Dad,\u201d he said, while we were driving down an A-road at the legal limit. And then, pointing to a car in front of us: \u201cThat\u2019s Leclerc. Catch him!\u201d It was an example of how F1 had infiltrated our life. In the end we did catch him \u2013 not Charles Leclerc, the Ferrari driver, but a middle-aged woman, her own kids in the back \u2013 and as we drove away my son seemed pleased. But the thrill of that moment didn\u2019t come close to those we had been granted access to on television.",

And, true to form, the man has come up with a genius way to end Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. (The United Nations, I hope you\u2019re listening!) Here we go \u2026 he wants to fight Vladimir Putin. Just him and Putin, man-to-man, battling it out.</p> <p>\u201cI hereby challenge [Vladimir Putin] to single combat,\u201d Musk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1503327421839417344\">tweeted</a> on Monday. \u201cStakes are [Ukraine].\u201d</p> <p>Putin was a little too busy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/vladimir-putin-war-criminal-ukraine-russia-president-justice\">committing war crimes</a> to reply but, don\u2019t worry, Musk still got the attention he so desperately craves. On Tuesday, the billionaire <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1503828461235982339?s=20&amp;t=YU7zvn8eybGFJDEEi67bTA\">shared a post</a> from the messaging app Telegram written by Ramzan Kadyrov, the pro-Putin head of the Chechen Republic. Kadyrov told Musk that he was in a completely different league from Putin and needed to \u201cpump up those muscles in order to change from the gentle (effeminate) Elona into the brutal Elon you need to be\u201d. Not one to let a humanitarian crisis distract him from a bit of banter Musk then changed his display name on Twitter from \u201cElon Musk\u201d to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/culture/internet/elon-musk-now-goes-by-elona-musk-on-twitter-heres-why/\">ElonaMusk</a>\u201c. (He has since changed it back.)</p> <p>All of this is completely idiotic, of course, but I have to admit that Musk is on to something here. Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if we replaced wars with wrestling matches between world leaders? Instead of killing innocent civilians, leaders could just duke it out among themselves. They get to stroke their egos and feel like Real Men\u2122 without everyone else paying for it.</p> <p>It\u2019s a nice idea but, of course, it\u2019s impossible to imagine it ever actually happening. You know what else is impossible to imagine? A real life Elona Musk. There could simply never be a female version of Musk. A woman could never act the childish way that Musk acts and still be revered as a brilliant entrepreneur. A female CEO could never get away with spending half her day <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/08/confusion-after-bbc-podcasts-attempt-to-define-shitposting-laura-kuenssberg\">shitposting</a> on Twitter and cracking juvenile jokes in the way that Musk does. People wouldn\u2019t take her seriously.</p> <p>That\u2019s not just my hypothesis \u2013 research shows that women are routinely held to far higher standards than men.<em> </em>A Rockefeller Foundation-commissioned <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2016/10/26/ceo-blame-woman-crisis/\">study</a>, for example, found 80% of news reports about female CEOs involved in a crisis cited the CEO as the problem. When a man was CEO, however, only 31% of stories blamed him for the company\u2019s issues. In a similar vein, a<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2016/06/02/480487259/women-held-to-higher-ethical-standard-than-men-study-shows\">2016 study</a> found female lawyers receive far harsher punishments than their male counterparts for ethical violations at work. The study looked at disciplinary punishments <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2016/06/02/480487259/women-held-to-higher-ethical-standard-than-men-study-shows\">handed out by the American Bar Association</a> and found that women had a 106% higher likelihood of being disbarred than a man for committing the same ethical infraction. And even women in prison get held to higher standards than men in prison: across the US women are <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/10/15/647874342/in-prison-discipline-comes-down-hardest-on-women\">disciplined at higher rates</a> than men for smaller infractions of prison rules.</p> <p>Even if a hypothetical Elona Musk didn\u2019t spend half her time insulting people with names like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/03/elon-musk-defamation-trial-begins-in-case-brought-by-british-diver\">\u201cpedo guy\u201d</a>, engaging in possible <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jun/02/elon-musk-tweets-tesla-sec-settlement\">violations of securities law</a>, and firing off <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-sexist-joke-tweets\">sexist tweets about \u201cTITS\u201d</a>, it\u2019s unlikely she\u2019d be lauded as a genius in the way Elon is. We are socially conditioned to think of brilliance and genius as male traits. Indeed a 2017 study found that girls as young as six are more likely to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/jan/26/girls-believe-brilliance-is-a-male-trait-research-into-gender-stereotypes-shows\">associate brilliance with the opposite sex</a>. That builds on previous research which found parents and teachers attribute good marks in maths to hard work for girls, but to natural ability for boys.</p> <p>A certain sort of person is constantly going on about how it would be great to have more women in power, but it\u2019s really important <em><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/paologaudiano/2017/10/23/how-to-increase-diversity-without-lowering-the-bar/\">not to lower the bar</a>. </em>Here\u2019s the thing: the bar is a hell of a lot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/24/rudy-giuliani-borat-slip-up-powerful-white-men\">lower</a> for men than it is for women. It\u2019s easier to imagine Mars being colonized in our lifetimes than an Elona Musk being taken seriously.</p> <h2>Idaho wants to let people profit from rape</h2> <p>Last year, Texas introduced an extreme abortion law that gave private citizens the right to sue anyone who aided or abetted an abortion for at least $10,000 in \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/02/sonia-sotomayor-dissent-texas-abortion-ban-law-supreme-court\">statutory damages</a>\u201d. Since then, a number of Republican-led states have seemingly been in competition to try to come up with even more dystopian legislation. Leading the charge is Idaho, which has <a href=\"https://www.rawstory.com/watch-idaho-bill-sponsor-admits-a-rapists-brother-or-sister-could-sue-doctor-who-performs-abortion/\">just passed a bill</a> that would effectively allow certain family members of a \u201cpreborn child\u201d to veto an abortion and sue anyone who aids or abets an abortion for damages starting at $20,000. As <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/03/idahos-anti-abortion-law-takes-a-page-from-texas-playbook.html\">Slate reports</a>: \u201cThe bill\u2019s sponsor, Republican state Representative Steven Harris, has confirmed that if a rapist has 10 siblings, each can sue for $20,000.\u201d Essentially then, the legislation financially incentivizes rape. And this wasn\u2019t even seen as particularly controversial: the bill was passed in the Idaho House of Representatives in a <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/idaho-texas-abortion-ban-rapists_n_6232b8bae4b046c938d6ac96\">51-to-14 vote</a>. The governor is expected to sign it into a law, and it may go into effect next month.</p> <h2>Avowed \u2018anti-feminist\u2019 elected next president of South Korea</h2> <p>Yoon Suk-yeol exploited the country\u2019s heated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/south-koreas-poisonous-gender-politics-a-test-for-next-president\">gender wars</a> in order to gain support from angry young male voters. It worked: he won a tightly contested election <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/south-korea-gender-equality-anti-feminist-president-yoon-suk-yeol\">last week</a>. However, Yoon might not be able to turn back the clock on women\u2019s rights as he much as he had hoped. One of the president-elect\u2019s big campaign promises was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/03/12/south-korea-election-yoon-suk-yeol-anti-feminism-gender-wars/\">abolishing</a> the government\u2019s ministry of gender equality and family \u2013 however, that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/skorea-president-elects-pledge-shutter-gender-ministry-stirs-debate-2022-03-18/\">requires approval from parliament</a>, which is controlled by the Democratic party. And they\u2019ve just appointed as its new interim leader a 26-year-old feminist who has been very critical of Yoon\u2019s policies.</p> <h2>Is there a \u2018romance gap\u2019? Bumble thinks so</h2> <p>According to a YouGov survey commissioned by the dating app, <a href=\"https://thebeehive.bumble.com/the-romance-gap\">74% of adults</a> think that, when it comes to romantic relationships and dating, different behaviours are expected based on your gender identity. People still expect men to take the lead, for example.

      "bodyText": "Could there ever be a real-life Elona Musk? Elon Musk may not be a diplomat but, as everyone knows, he is a genius. And, true to form, the man has come up with a genius way to end Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. (The United Nations, I hope you\u2019re listening!) Here we go \u2026 he wants to fight Vladimir Putin. Just him and Putin, man-to-man, battling it out. \u201cI hereby challenge [Vladimir Putin] to single combat,\u201d Musk tweeted on Monday. \u201cStakes are [Ukraine].\u201d Putin was a little too busy committing war crimes to reply but, don\u2019t worry, Musk still got the attention he so desperately craves. On Tuesday, the billionaire shared a post from the messaging app Telegram written by Ramzan Kadyrov, the pro-Putin head of the Chechen Republic. Kadyrov told Musk that he was in a completely different league from Putin and needed to \u201cpump up those muscles in order to change from the gentle (effeminate) Elona into the brutal Elon you need to be\u201d. Not one to let a humanitarian crisis distract him from a bit of banter Musk then changed his display name on Twitter from \u201cElon Musk\u201d to \u201cElonaMusk\u201c. (He has since changed it back.) All of this is completely idiotic, of course, but I have to admit that Musk is on to something here. Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if we replaced wars with wrestling matches between world leaders? Instead of killing innocent civilians, leaders could just duke it out among themselves. They get to stroke their egos and feel like Real Men\u2122 without everyone else paying for it. It\u2019s a nice idea but, of course, it\u2019s impossible to imagine it ever actually happening. You know what else is impossible to imagine? A real life Elona Musk. There could simply never be a female version of Musk. A woman could never act the childish way that Musk acts and still be revered as a brilliant entrepreneur. A female CEO could never get away with spending half her day shitposting on Twitter and cracking juvenile jokes in the way that Musk does. People wouldn\u2019t take her seriously. That\u2019s not just my hypothesis \u2013 research shows that women are routinely held to far higher standards than men. A Rockefeller Foundation-commissioned study, for example, found 80% of news reports about female CEOs involved in a crisis cited the CEO as the problem. When a man was CEO, however, only 31% of stories blamed him for the company\u2019s issues. In a similar vein, a 2016 study found female lawyers receive far harsher punishments than their male counterparts for ethical violations at work. The study looked at disciplinary punishments handed out by the American Bar Association and found that women had a 106% higher likelihood of being disbarred than a man for committing the same ethical infraction. And even women in prison get held to higher standards than men in prison: across the US women are disciplined at higher rates than men for smaller infractions of prison rules. Even if a hypothetical Elona Musk didn\u2019t spend half her time insulting people with names like \u201cpedo guy\u201d, engaging in possible violations of securities law, and firing off sexist tweets about \u201cTITS\u201d, it\u2019s unlikely she\u2019d be lauded as a genius in the way Elon is. We are socially conditioned to think of brilliance and genius as male traits. Indeed a 2017 study found that girls as young as six are more likely to associate brilliance with the opposite sex. That builds on previous research which found parents and teachers attribute good marks in maths to hard work for girls, but to natural ability for boys. A certain sort of person is constantly going on about how it would be great to have more women in power, but it\u2019s really important not to lower the bar. Here\u2019s the thing: the bar is a hell of a lot lower for men than it is for women. It\u2019s easier to imagine Mars being colonized in our lifetimes than an Elona Musk being taken seriously. Idaho wants to let people profit from rape Last year, Texas introduced an extreme abortion law that gave private citizens the right to sue anyone who aided or abetted an abortion for at least $10,000 in \u201cstatutory damages\u201d. Since then, a number of Republican-led states have seemingly been in competition to try to come up with even more dystopian legislation. Leading the charge is Idaho, which has just passed a bill that would effectively allow certain family members of a \u201cpreborn child\u201d to veto an abortion and sue anyone who aids or abets an abortion for damages starting at $20,000. As Slate reports: \u201cThe bill\u2019s sponsor, Republican state Representative Steven Harris, has confirmed that if a rapist has 10 siblings, each can sue for $20,000.\u201d Essentially then, the legislation financially incentivizes rape. And this wasn\u2019t even seen as particularly controversial: the bill was passed in the Idaho House of Representatives in a 51-to-14 vote. The governor is expected to sign it into a law, and it may go into effect next month. Avowed \u2018anti-feminist\u2019 elected next president of South Korea Yoon Suk-yeol exploited the country\u2019s heated gender wars in order to gain support from angry young male voters. It worked: he won a tightly contested election last week. However, Yoon might not be able to turn back the clock on women\u2019s rights as he much as he had hoped. One of the president-elect\u2019s big campaign promises was abolishing the government\u2019s ministry of gender equality and family \u2013 however, that requires approval from parliament, which is controlled by the Democratic party. And they\u2019ve just appointed as its new interim leader a 26-year-old feminist who has been very critical of Yoon\u2019s policies. Is there a \u2018romance gap\u2019? Bumble thinks so According to a YouGov survey commissioned by the dating app, 74% of adults think that, when it comes to romantic relationships and dating, different behaviours are expected based on your gender identity. People still expect men to take the lead, for example. And 33% of women said they had changed their behaviour to make someone feel more powerful while dating or in a relationship The week in pawtriarchy Time for some good mews, I reckon! So, please meet Stepan: a 13-year-old tabby cat with more than a million followers on TikTok. Stepan and his owner, Anna, are Ukrainian but recently managed to escape to safety in France. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got that many followers you can use them as a network to provide aid, find shelter or even help find escape routes in a war zone,\u201d a humanitarian expert told the Washington Post. \u201cHaving an online network will help you survive difficult times.\u201d Someone should probably tell the kids in Yemen that if they just get an Instagram-famous cat the world might give more of a damn about them, eh?

The 20-year-old vocalist, whose real name was Timothy Starks, was arrested by Miami-Dade officers at 2am in Opa-locka, Florida on Tuesday after they pulled him over for driving with an obscured number plate. On searching his car, police found a fully loaded Glock 32 pistol. He was released on bond on a gun charge and left the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center at 2pm on Wednesday. He was picked up by a friend, Dante Collins Banks, in a red Nissan car. When they turned on to the Palmetto expressway, a gunman in another vehicle opened fire on them in the middle of traffic. Starks was shot in the head and died at the scene. Banks was wounded in the stomach and transported to the Jackson Memorial hospital where he remains in a stable condition. Detectives have not identified a suspect but told the Miami Herald that \u201ca dark-coloured vehicle was seen fleeing the area at a high rate of speed\u201d. Starks was only identified on Friday as the victim of the shooting. On hearing of his death, one fan wrote on Twitter: \u201cDamn they killed baby cino soon as he got out.\u201d Another posted: \u201cThats crazy how Baby Cino died smh, someone was watching his ass leaving jail.\u201d \u201cDetectives are looking at every motive or every bit of information based on the evidence they have here at the scene,\u201d the Miami-Dade police detective Angel Rodriguez told the local TV channel WPLG. \u201cAs you can see, the car has a significant amount of bullet holes.\u201d Law-enforcement sources told the Herald that the shooting was being investigated for links to a series of public ambushes in recent months that are thought to be connected to Miami street gangs. Starks was believed to be associated with a gang known as \u201cBoss Life\u201d in the Little Haiti area of Miami. His best-known song, a track titled Big Haiti Shottas, features him and an entourage rapping about violence at a local apartment building. The lyrics include the lines: \u201cSpot \u2019em, I got \u2019em/If it\u2019s an issue or a problem, we\u2019ll pull up with them choppers/We\u2019ll leave him dead on the scene/Hell na he ain\u2019t making it to the doctor.\u201d The accompanying music video was dedicated to Gary \u201cMelo\u201d Laguerre, an 18-year-old murdered in a drive-by shooting in 2020. \u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 20 March 2022 to clarify that Baby Cino had been released from jail, not prison.",

There are 90 Barbadians who have played Test cricket on the list and eight more have won white-ball caps alone. Add the four players to cross the Atlantic and represent England \u2013 Roland Butcher, Gladstone Small, Chris Jordan and Jofra Archer \u2013 and its bat is already raised before getting to its 15 West Indies women and the 11 men to have played for associate nations.</p> <p>\u201cEverything suggests that it is highly likely the most verdant place in the history of the sport,\u201d says Andrew Samson, the leading cricket statistician, after he and the local journalist David Harris helped confirm the numbers. \u201cIf not in terms of square miles then at least per capita.

The numbers fluctuate and have dropped in the current side \u2013 four of the most recent XI \u2013 but they are still led by Kraigg Brathwaite, boast a world-class all-rounder in Jason Holder and have Kemar Roach, a fast bowler who went into the second Test 15 wickets away from becoming the sixth West Indian to reach the 250 mark.</p> <p>\u201cIt really just comes back to the love the people have for the game,\u201d says Roland Butcher, who grew up in St Philip on the eastern side of the island. He went on to become the first black cricketer to represent England when he made his Test debut at this storied ground in 1981 and the local headline read \u201cOur boy, their bat\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cCricket is in the blood of Barbadians, it just became a natural thing to us like football is in Brazil. In the past black people were limited in the sports they could do and for me, growing up in the country, all that was available was cricket and track and field. Most of the great players came out of informal cricket, kids playing among themselves. There wasn\u2019t coaching, the game itself was the teacher.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aa369d0e6ced21691a17728f72df9a615362451e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa369d0e6ced21691a17728f72df9a615362451e/0_130_1969_3444/572.jpg\" alt=\"The Barbados and West Indies legend Malcolm Marshall in full flow in 1986\" width=\"572\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Barbados and West Indies legend Malcolm Marshall in full flow in 1986.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Murrell/Picture library</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Theories abound as to why this came to be. Certainly the island had a head start, with St Ann\u2019s Garrison south of Bridgetown the first club formed in the Caribbean in 1806. Some have noted the influence of the military in integrating the sport into society or the club scene, others the island\u2019s porous coral rock and abundant sunshine, which combine to make ideal surfaces for fast bowling and stroke play. For Butcher it also comes down to early heroes and the sharpening of skills in those more rustic settings.</p> <p>\u201cI think the rest of the region recognises the role Barbados has played in West Indies cricket,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I agree with the saying that when Barbados is strong, West Indies is strong, but we\u2019ve had such a rich history and legacy of great players here, we\u2019ve always had people to look up to here. That breeds more.</p> <p>\u201cI would only see the great players on film once a month when a van came to our school with a big screen and they showed maybe an old Test match along with films like Laurel and Hardy. But ultimately it was about playing the sport.</p> <p>\u201cWe played anywhere and everywhere.

      "bodyText": "West Indies v England at Kensington Oval is a special occasion that takes place on sacred ground; a country so lush by way of cricketing talent per head over the years, Barbados stands out as one of world sport\u2019s most remarkable hotspots. Before the roll call of great Barbadian cricketers spools down the page, first consider the numbers: with a population of 287,000, the new republic would sit fourth bottom were it ranked alongside England\u2019s 48 counties, tucked between Herefordshire and Northumberland (with more palm trees than either). And yet this 21-miles-by-14-miles island, the most easterly in the Lesser Antilles, is the first in the Caribbean to produce more than a century of international cricketers. Of the 385 men to play for West Indies since they first took the field at Lord\u2019s in 1928, 98 (25.45%) hail from Barbados, with the far more populous Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago next on 83. There are 90 Barbadians who have played Test cricket on the list and eight more have won white-ball caps alone. Add the four players to cross the Atlantic and represent England \u2013 Roland Butcher, Gladstone Small, Chris Jordan and Jofra Archer \u2013 and its bat is already raised before getting to its 15 West Indies women and the 11 men to have played for associate nations. \u201cEverything suggests that it is highly likely the most verdant place in the history of the sport,\u201d says Andrew Samson, the leading cricket statistician, after he and the local journalist David Harris helped confirm the numbers. \u201cIf not in terms of square miles then at least per capita. And I would imagine it would be in the conversation for any international sport, not just cricket.\u201d As England\u2019s cricketers and their sun-seeking supporters have taken in their surroundings during the second Test they will have noted that this is not just quantity but quality, whether walking past the statue of Sir Garfield Sobers, reading the names of Wes Hall, Charlie Griffith, Everton Weekes, Frank Worrell, Clyde Walcott, Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes adorning the stands or spying the two ends, Malcolm Marshall and Joel Garner. This isn\u2019t just a nostalgia trip either; when West Indies routed England here three years ago, six of the XI were Bajan. The numbers fluctuate and have dropped in the current side \u2013 four of the most recent XI \u2013 but they are still led by Kraigg Brathwaite, boast a world-class all-rounder in Jason Holder and have Kemar Roach, a fast bowler who went into the second Test 15 wickets away from becoming the sixth West Indian to reach the 250 mark. \u201cIt really just comes back to the love the people have for the game,\u201d says Roland Butcher, who grew up in St Philip on the eastern side of the island. He went on to become the first black cricketer to represent England when he made his Test debut at this storied ground in 1981 and the local headline read \u201cOur boy, their bat\u201d. \u201cCricket is in the blood of Barbadians, it just became a natural thing to us like football is in Brazil. In the past black people were limited in the sports they could do and for me, growing up in the country, all that was available was cricket and track and field. Most of the great players came out of informal cricket, kids playing among themselves. There wasn\u2019t coaching, the game itself was the teacher.\u201d Theories abound as to why this came to be. Certainly the island had a head start, with St Ann\u2019s Garrison south of Bridgetown the first club formed in the Caribbean in 1806. Some have noted the influence of the military in integrating the sport into society or the club scene, others the island\u2019s porous coral rock and abundant sunshine, which combine to make ideal surfaces for fast bowling and stroke play. For Butcher it also comes down to early heroes and the sharpening of skills in those more rustic settings. \u201cI think the rest of the region recognises the role Barbados has played in West Indies cricket,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I agree with the saying that when Barbados is strong, West Indies is strong, but we\u2019ve had such a rich history and legacy of great players here, we\u2019ve always had people to look up to here. That breeds more. \u201cI would only see the great players on film once a month when a van came to our school with a big screen and they showed maybe an old Test match along with films like Laurel and Hardy. But ultimately it was about playing the sport. \u201cWe played anywhere and everywhere. Playing on the beach, the edge of the surf, the ball skids on from the surface and your reactions have to be quicker. When we played on turf we prepared the pitches ourselves, picking out stones, wetting it and rolling it. But the ball still deviated and you needed sharp reflexes. These may seem like disadvantages but they became advantages to us.\u201d Butcher has worked as a coach and an administrator in Barbados since his playing days, recently retiring from the island\u2019s first-class selection panel but still a board director and on the Cricket West Indies cricket strategy committee. Contrary to the notion that the region was left behind when professionalism took hold elsewhere, he wonders whether modern coaching has in fact been too regimented and conformist for this part of the world, ironing out some of the instinct rather than enhancing it. \u201cThese days the players don\u2019t find out so much for themselves,\u201d says the 68-year-old. \u201cBefore, we were different from the rest of the world, playing free and spirited cricket. But we joined the bandwagon of restrictive coaching and it doesn\u2019t always allow for players to play naturally, they get caught between two stalls.\u201d It makes an interesting counterpoint as English cricket, blessed with enviable resources and numbers, launches its latest corporate response to defeat in Australia with a game-wide review into structures, elite pathways, competitions and the like.

If it doesn\u2019t say that the bulbs are pesticide-free, you can be assured they have been grown with chemicals, which is not good for the soil, rivers and wildlife where they came from (mostly the Netherlands) \u2013 and not good for yours either. Whereas Organic Bulbs and Natural Bulbs both offer organically grown corms at good prices, so please consider supporting them.",

The year is 1933 and, while his celebrity and his wealth are unassailable, Picasso\u2019s marriage to the Russian ballerina Olga Khokhlova has entered its bitter endgame. Meanwhile, his relationship with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jul/02/unseen-picasso-portrait-muse-marie-therese-walter-sothebys-auction\" title=\"\">ma\u00eetresse-en-titre Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter</a>, tucked away in the country, is beginning to pall even before it has properly hit its stride.

The increasingly despised Olga appears in a series of nightmare images \u2013 as a hideously toothy horse, as a wonky ballerina straining to hold her arms above her head and, worst of all, as a disappointed bride whose veil is slipping off the end of her nose. Earth mother Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, meanwhile, is transposed into what Richardson describes as \u201ca kinky cluster of boxed vaginas, beehive breasts, and turdlike fingers\u201d. Then there is glamorous Dora, depicted famously in The Weeping Woman with a green face, stringy hair and sausage fingers. As Richardson pithily puts it: \u201cPicasso Picassified people.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t only women who were fighting over Picasso. The surrealists, that group of Paris-based painters and writers who reached deep into the newly fashionable unconscious for inspiration, were eager to claim the most famous artist of the day for themselves. The figurative but distorted forms that Picasso was producing resonated powerfully with the dreamscapes that paid-up surrealists such as Salvador Dal\u00ed and Andr\u00e9 Breton were producing. While Picasso was not generally a joiner, he agreed to design the cover for the first issue of Minotaure, the influential magazine of the movement that was launched in 1933.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/mar/12/sir-john-richardson-obituary\">Sir John Richardson obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The mythical figure of the minotaur \u2013 part-man, part-bull \u2013 functioned more personally as an alter ego for Picasso, representing all his lasciviousness, guilt and despair. His identification emerged out of a renewed relationship with his native Spain and its cult of the bullfight. With Franco in power, and the country at war with itself, it no longer felt possible for Picasso to maintain his previous position of studied political neutrality. In 1937 he embarked on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/26/pablo-picasso-guernica-spain-war\" title=\"\">Guernica</a>, the massive painting that dramatised the apocalyptic destruction of a Basque village by the Nazi Luftwaffe. The tangle of mangled limbs, weeping women and dead children remains the single most powerful anti-war painting ever produced, and cemented Picasso\u2019s status as the greatest artist of the 20th century.</p> <p>What has always made Richardson\u2019s biographical work on Picasso so alive is the fact of his personal friendship with the artist. It is thrilling to read a narrative in which scholarly prose is regularly interrupted with the phrase \u201cPicasso once told me \u2026 \u201d followed by an entirely fresh anecdote. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/mar/12/sir-john-richardson-obituary\" title=\"\">Richardson died in 2019</a> at the age of 95 before finishing this book, and there are signs in the later chapters, completed by his research associates, of a slackening of pace.

Meanwhile, his relationship with ma\u00eetresse-en-titre Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter, tucked away in the country, is beginning to pall even before it has properly hit its stride. Waiting in the wings is Dora Maar, the surrealist photographer who will dominate Picasso\u2019s life, mostly painfully, for the next eight years. Richardson shows himself as deft as ever at making connections between Picasso\u2019s tumultuous private life and his art. The increasingly despised Olga appears in a series of nightmare images \u2013 as a hideously toothy horse, as a wonky ballerina straining to hold her arms above her head and, worst of all, as a disappointed bride whose veil is slipping off the end of her nose. Earth mother Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, meanwhile, is transposed into what Richardson describes as \u201ca kinky cluster of boxed vaginas, beehive breasts, and turdlike fingers\u201d. Then there is glamorous Dora, depicted famously in The Weeping Woman with a green face, stringy hair and sausage fingers. As Richardson pithily puts it: \u201cPicasso Picassified people.\u201d It wasn\u2019t only women who were fighting over Picasso. The surrealists, that group of Paris-based painters and writers who reached deep into the newly fashionable unconscious for inspiration, were eager to claim the most famous artist of the day for themselves. The figurative but distorted forms that Picasso was producing resonated powerfully with the dreamscapes that paid-up surrealists such as Salvador Dal\u00ed and Andr\u00e9 Breton were producing. While Picasso was not generally a joiner, he agreed to design the cover for the first issue of Minotaure, the influential magazine of the movement that was launched in 1933. The mythical figure of the minotaur \u2013 part-man, part-bull \u2013 functioned more personally as an alter ego for Picasso, representing all his lasciviousness, guilt and despair. His identification emerged out of a renewed relationship with his native Spain and its cult of the bullfight. With Franco in power, and the country at war with itself, it no longer felt possible for Picasso to maintain his previous position of studied political neutrality. In 1937 he embarked on Guernica, the massive painting that dramatised the apocalyptic destruction of a Basque village by the Nazi Luftwaffe. The tangle of mangled limbs, weeping women and dead children remains the single most powerful anti-war painting ever produced, and cemented Picasso\u2019s status as the greatest artist of the 20th century. What has always made Richardson\u2019s biographical work on Picasso so alive is the fact of his personal friendship with the artist. It is thrilling to read a narrative in which scholarly prose is regularly interrupted with the phrase \u201cPicasso once told me \u2026 \u201d followed by an entirely fresh anecdote. Richardson died in 2019 at the age of 95 before finishing this book, and there are signs in the later chapters, completed by his research associates, of a slackening of pace. How lucky we are, though, that Richardson lived long enough to get this far, even if he departed leaving Picasso with three decades of life and art yet to live. \u2022 A Life of Picasso: The Minotaur Years 1933-43 by John Richardson is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a335).

After recording a more than 7% primary vote swing towards it across the state, Labor was on track to win 26 seats and form majority government, ending Steven Marshall\u2019s Liberal government after just one term. This would be the worst result for the Liberal party since the 2006 \u201cRannslide\u201d victory to Mike Rann in 2006. The premier conceded defeat to the opposition leader, Peter Malinauskas, at around 9pm on Saturday night. Premier-elect Malinauskas began his victory speech with an acknowledgment to country, and pledging to progress a state-based treaty and voice for the Aboriginal people of SA. \u201cI would like to take this opportunity to thank the people of South Australia \u2013 it is not lost on me the significance of the privilege and the size of the responsibility that you have invested in me and my team,\u201d he said. Malinauskas said that while election nights were often about the elation of victory for Labor, \u201ctrue satisfaction for us comes in realising our ambition, our ideal, of delivering a fairer, better, society and more opportunities for those that need it most.\u201d \u201cI do believe that we have the policy and the plan to realise that ambition, but more than that I know that I lead the team to deliver it,\u201d he said. Malinauskas also thanked the Liberal party, saying \u201cthey may be our adversaries, but they are not our enemies,\u201d acknowledging Liberal MPs who had lost their seats and the service of Marshall for the past four years.

He said it had been an \u201chonour and privilege\u201d to serve as premier. The ABC election analyst Antony Green said there was \u201cno doubt\u201d that Labor would form government with swings towards Labor across the state. The likely loss for the Liberal party after just one term makes it the first incumbent government to lose an election since the beginning of the Covid pandemic. Premier Steven Marshall\u2019s own seat of Dunstan \u2013 held on a margin of 7.4% \u2013 was also at risk of falling to the Labor party where there was a 6.2% swing against him in early voting. The deputy premier, Dan Van Holst Pelekaan, was also likely to lose his safe regional seat of Stuart after a redistribution put former Labor-aligned independent Geoff Brock\u2019s hometown of Port Pirie into the electorate. Labor has won the marginal seats of Elder, Newland and Adelaide, and is also likely to win the seat of Davenport. It was also ahead in the other key marginal seat of King. Labor holds 19 seats in the 47 seat House of Assembly while the Liberal party holds 22. Labor needed to win four seats to form majority government. As of 5pm on Sunday figures from the Electoral Commission of SA showed the Labor party had received 40.4% of first preference votes, the Liberal Party 34.6% and the Greens 9.6%.

      "body": "<p>Last week, we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/11/facebook-and-instagram-let-users-call-for-death-to-russian-soldiers-over-ukraine\">learned</a> that Meta \u2013 the parent company of Facebook and Instagram \u2013 has temporarily changed its rules and will allow certain posts calling for violence to remain on its platforms. Users of Facebook and Instagram who live in countries close to Ukraine will be permitted to post calls for violence against Russian soldiers and even for the deaths of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko \u2013 though without specifics of location or method, the company stipulated.</p> <p>\u201cAs a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine we have temporarily made allowances for forms of political expression that would normally violate our rules, like violent speech such as \u2018death to the Russian invaders\u2019. We still won\u2019t allow credible calls for violence against Russian civilians,\u201d Meta said in a statement.</p> <p>Meta may be the biggest social media company to make changes to its operations, though it\u2019s hardly the only one. You won\u2019t find any Russian state-funded media videos on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/11/youtube-blocks-russian-state-funded-media\">YouTube</a> any longer, as Google, YouTube\u2019s parent company, has blocked access to any channel that hosts those videos. TikTok, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/07/tiktok-restricts-service-in-russia-netflix-stops-streaming-ukraine\">announced</a> that it would block livestreaming and uploading of new content in Russia after the Kremlin passed a new law criminalizing what it considers to be \u201cfake\u201d news about its invasion of Ukraine. But Meta\u2019s announcement, which has the company allowing more content rather than less, sets it apart from the others.</p> <p>In some ways, this brazen announcement is a welcome one, but not for its encouragement of violence. (The use of violence here is at bottom a moral question, though the right to armed resistance against a belligerent occupation is generally <a href=\"https://www.icrc.org/en/doc/assets/files/other/law9_final.pdf\">recognized under international law</a>.) Meta\u2019s statement is welcome because it clarifies something that many of us have already known for some time. When it comes to political speech, Facebook\u2019s policies have never been applied evenly.</p> <p>Palestinians know this double standard better than most. Last May, when the Israeli government was seeking to forcibly uproot Palestinian families from their homes in Sheikh Jarrah, protests broke out on the streets of Jerusalem and on screens across the world. Facebook and Instagram were hardly neutral spaces for information-sharing during this period, and Facebook was definitely not on the side of the occupied in that situation. </p> <p>\u201cFacebook has suppressed content posted by Palestinians and their supporters speaking out about human rights issues in Israel and Palestine,\u201d Human Rights Watch wrote in <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/10/08/israel/palestine-facebook-censors-discussion-rights-issues\">a scathing report</a> issued in October 2021. The suppressed speech that Human Rights Watch refers to was not even violent speech. Often, it was simply \u201creposts of content from mainstream news organizations\u201d by Palestinians.</p> <p>\u201cIn one instance,\u201d the report says, \u201cInstagram removed a screenshot of headlines and photos from three New York Times opinion articles for which the Instagram user added commentary that urged Palestinians to \u2018never concede\u2019 their rights. The post did not transform the material in any way that could reasonably be construed as incitement to violence or hatred.\u201d</p> <p>All in all, social media watchdog groups found more than 700 examples of content being deleted, hashtags being hidden, accounts being closed, archived content being deleted, and more. Facebook and Instagram, the report notes, accounted for 85% of those restrictions.</p> <p>Palestinians have become accustomed to fighting against this type of national erasure, though that doesn\u2019t make it any less exhausting to confront. With its latest move, however, Facebook is not only acknowledging that it plays an important role in directing global politics, but is also now taking a very public position against foreign military occupation. This is an excellent development. Is Facebook now committing to transparency and to the principles of international law? Surely, we must hope so. Otherwise, the internet behemoth will come off merely as a corporate partisan of American and Western European positions rather than as a potential vehicle to uphold universally agreed-upon values. Therein lies the difference between Facebook\u2019s Ukraine and Palestine stances.</p> <p>In other words, Facebook\u2019s announcement could and should help us make the connections between besieged and occupied people everywhere and increase the desire to fight for them equally, and we should and will now be expecting Facebook to do the same. That\u2019s why pointing out Facebook\u2019s double standard between Ukraine and Palestine is about more than exposing a hypocritical past. It\u2019s about raising the bar on everyone\u2019s behavior. As such, it\u2019s also the opposite of \u201cwhataboutism.\u201d</p> <p>In case you\u2019re not familiar with \u201cwhataboutism,\u201d this is a term that refers to a rhetorical strategy of skillful deflection. Whataboutism aims to move the subject of conversation away from one party\u2019s evil actions by pointing out the sins of another. Let\u2019s say you are angry about what Russia is doing in Ukraine. Then, someone asks you, \u201cbut what about what the US is doing in Somalia?\u201d Soon, the conversation is no longer about Russia and only about the United States. Whataboutism = deflect, distract, demobilize.</p> <p>Whataboutism has permeated so much of today\u2019s discourse around Russia\u2019s invasion, and often at Russia\u2019s behest. Perhaps you saw that map circulating on social media the day Russia began its most recent invasion of Ukraine. The graphic, titled \u201cAirstrikes in the last 48 Hours,\u201d purported to show areas around the world that had recently been bombed by various powers on the same day of Russia\u2019s incursion.

      "bodyText": "Last week, we learned that Meta \u2013 the parent company of Facebook and Instagram \u2013 has temporarily changed its rules and will allow certain posts calling for violence to remain on its platforms. Users of Facebook and Instagram who live in countries close to Ukraine will be permitted to post calls for violence against Russian soldiers and even for the deaths of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko \u2013 though without specifics of location or method, the company stipulated. \u201cAs a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine we have temporarily made allowances for forms of political expression that would normally violate our rules, like violent speech such as \u2018death to the Russian invaders\u2019. We still won\u2019t allow credible calls for violence against Russian civilians,\u201d Meta said in a statement. Meta may be the biggest social media company to make changes to its operations, though it\u2019s hardly the only one. You won\u2019t find any Russian state-funded media videos on YouTube any longer, as Google, YouTube\u2019s parent company, has blocked access to any channel that hosts those videos. TikTok, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, announced that it would block livestreaming and uploading of new content in Russia after the Kremlin passed a new law criminalizing what it considers to be \u201cfake\u201d news about its invasion of Ukraine. But Meta\u2019s announcement, which has the company allowing more content rather than less, sets it apart from the others. In some ways, this brazen announcement is a welcome one, but not for its encouragement of violence. (The use of violence here is at bottom a moral question, though the right to armed resistance against a belligerent occupation is generally recognized under international law.) Meta\u2019s statement is welcome because it clarifies something that many of us have already known for some time. When it comes to political speech, Facebook\u2019s policies have never been applied evenly. Palestinians know this double standard better than most. Last May, when the Israeli government was seeking to forcibly uproot Palestinian families from their homes in Sheikh Jarrah, protests broke out on the streets of Jerusalem and on screens across the world. Facebook and Instagram were hardly neutral spaces for information-sharing during this period, and Facebook was definitely not on the side of the occupied in that situation. \u201cFacebook has suppressed content posted by Palestinians and their supporters speaking out about human rights issues in Israel and Palestine,\u201d Human Rights Watch wrote in a scathing report issued in October 2021. The suppressed speech that Human Rights Watch refers to was not even violent speech. Often, it was simply \u201creposts of content from mainstream news organizations\u201d by Palestinians. \u201cIn one instance,\u201d the report says, \u201cInstagram removed a screenshot of headlines and photos from three New York Times opinion articles for which the Instagram user added commentary that urged Palestinians to \u2018never concede\u2019 their rights. The post did not transform the material in any way that could reasonably be construed as incitement to violence or hatred.\u201d All in all, social media watchdog groups found more than 700 examples of content being deleted, hashtags being hidden, accounts being closed, archived content being deleted, and more. Facebook and Instagram, the report notes, accounted for 85% of those restrictions. Palestinians have become accustomed to fighting against this type of national erasure, though that doesn\u2019t make it any less exhausting to confront. With its latest move, however, Facebook is not only acknowledging that it plays an important role in directing global politics, but is also now taking a very public position against foreign military occupation. This is an excellent development. Is Facebook now committing to transparency and to the principles of international law? Surely, we must hope so. Otherwise, the internet behemoth will come off merely as a corporate partisan of American and Western European positions rather than as a potential vehicle to uphold universally agreed-upon values. Therein lies the difference between Facebook\u2019s Ukraine and Palestine stances. In other words, Facebook\u2019s announcement could and should help us make the connections between besieged and occupied people everywhere and increase the desire to fight for them equally, and we should and will now be expecting Facebook to do the same. That\u2019s why pointing out Facebook\u2019s double standard between Ukraine and Palestine is about more than exposing a hypocritical past. It\u2019s about raising the bar on everyone\u2019s behavior. As such, it\u2019s also the opposite of \u201cwhataboutism.\u201d In case you\u2019re not familiar with \u201cwhataboutism,\u201d this is a term that refers to a rhetorical strategy of skillful deflection. Whataboutism aims to move the subject of conversation away from one party\u2019s evil actions by pointing out the sins of another. Let\u2019s say you are angry about what Russia is doing in Ukraine. Then, someone asks you, \u201cbut what about what the US is doing in Somalia?\u201d Soon, the conversation is no longer about Russia and only about the United States. Whataboutism = deflect, distract, demobilize. Whataboutism has permeated so much of today\u2019s discourse around Russia\u2019s invasion, and often at Russia\u2019s behest. Perhaps you saw that map circulating on social media the day Russia began its most recent invasion of Ukraine. The graphic, titled \u201cAirstrikes in the last 48 Hours,\u201d purported to show areas around the world that had recently been bombed by various powers on the same day of Russia\u2019s incursion. The image, shared thousands of times on social media, was distributed by the Berlin-based media group Redfish in a classic example of whataboutism. (And, as it turns out, Redfish is sponsored by none other than the Kremlin.) In an article about this specific map, Vice quoted Idrees Ahmad, a lecturer in digital journalism at the University of Stirling, who explained that in cases of Whataboutism, \u201cthe hypocrisy being alluded to is often real, and can trigger righteous fury in the audience.\u201d But people, Ahmad said, \u201care duped because the aim is not to generate greater sympathy for a different conflict but to deflect attention from the one at hand.\u201d Facebook\u2019s announcement of its newfound political bravery should awaken us to the fact that we need new terminologies that connect - rather than misdirect us from \u2013 the common human struggles for liberty that we see and experience around us. \u201cAnd-also-ism\u201d is my (admittedly poor) candidate for a term that captures this idea, but I recognize that there may be a simpler way around the issue. Come to think of it, how\u2019s this for a word: Freedom. Freedom for Ukrainians. Freedom for Palestinians. Freedom from invasion. Freedom from occupation. Freedom for one. Freedom for all. Freedom.

      "body": "<p>Is this bag too heavy? Do my boots pinch? Am I fit enough? Do I look a complete anorak in this cagoule? There is nothing like the prospect of a multi-day, long-distance footpath to rouse lurking anxieties and keep you awake at night for weeks beforehand. And there is always the helpful soul who insists you must take a particular item: a thick hardback volume on the benefits of walking? Lovely.</p> <p>A selection of artisanal cheeses and a bottle of fizz? I\u2019ll squeeze them in somehow. Once for me, in Yemen, it was a pistol, presented with the comforting words: \u201cTake this \u2013 you\u2019re going to need it.\u201d</p> <p>Then, finally, you begin. You are moving and eventually comes the realisation that, assuming you manage the feat of placing one foot in front of the other, you will make it. You dump the hardback book and pistol, scoff the food, quaff the drink; your bag gets significantly lighter. The sun comes out and all the mountains stand before you. With luck, there are no more cars, no power lines or pavements for a long time to come.</p> <p>Within a few hours you are looking back and saying, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve walked so far already!\u201d Within a few days, you say, \u201cI just want to keep going forever.\u201d (There will be moments when you bitterly regret that one.) You have entered the real world, the one you now prefer. You are a long-distance European mountain walker. So here are some ideas, some real walks to be considered.</p> <h2><strong>The Malerweg (Painters\u2019 Path)</strong><strong>, Germany</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a9c42a4c4d4ccd4695dd75020a53c7ae3ee7a53b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9c42a4c4d4ccd4695dd75020a53c7ae3ee7a53b/0_279_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sandstone mountains on the Malerweg route.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sandstone mountains on the Malerweg route.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: mauritius images GmbH/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1766 two Dresden art teachers, Anton Graff and Adrian Zingg, set off on a trip into Saxony, heading through the town of Pirna, south-east of their home, into a region of mountains, mists and deep valleys that now straddles the border of Germany and the Czech Republic. Other painters, including Caspar David Friedrich, soon followed, triggering a romantic art movement and a love of hiking.</p> <p>In 2006 a new path, the Malerweg or Painters\u2019 Path, opened, a 71-mile circuit that has quickly become a German classic. Normally done over eight days, the walk takes in highlights such as sandstone outcrops and massifs such as the Schrammtor and Schrammsteine, where the trail burrows up narrow canyons, often on ladders, to magnificent views. Don\u2019t bring a massive, wide backpack \u2013 you will get stuck \u2013 but come with sketching gear. There is plenty of accommodation in guesthouses along the path, but there are some campsites, too, and pitching under rock overhangs is tolerated.<br><strong>More details</strong> on the official website: <a href=\"https://www.saechsische-schweiz.de/en/home-malerweg.html\" title=\"\">Malerweg</a>. <a href=\"https://hiking-navigator.com/malerweg/\" title=\"\">Hiking Navigator</a> has a very useful stage-by-stage guide<br><strong>Tours</strong> <a href=\"https://www.thenaturaladventure.com/tours/saxon-switzerland-malerweg-trail-classic-route/\" title=\"\">The Natural Adventure Company</a> offers a great self-guided walk of the Malerweg from \u00a3765pp, which includes nine nights in hotels, luggage transfers and breakfasts</p> <h2><strong>Alta Via 1, the Dolomites</strong><strong>, Italy</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f3806be58b5a77b6c1a7ed9a251715a1eb57eb65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3806be58b5a77b6c1a7ed9a251715a1eb57eb65/0_1109_3024_2392/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lago di Braies in the Dolomites\" width=\"1000\" height=\"791\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lago di Braies in the Dolomites, surrounded by limestone peaks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Eger/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was on the Alta Via 1 that I first experienced the magic of the Dolomites. We had hiked up the trail to the <a href=\"https://www.caicortina.org/rifugio-nuvolau/\" title=\"\">Rifugio Nuvolau</a> mountain hut in broad sunshine, but as the day ended clouds came rolling in from the Adriatic Sea, blossoming above the 3,000-metre peaks in dramatic thunderheads that were then slowly torn apart by the wind in the dying rays of a ripening red sun. In many years of mountain walking and climbing I had never witnessed anything like it. Eventually we went inside the hut for a hearty, home-cooked dinner and asked the manager if he\u2019d seen the spectacle outside: he nodded, grinning, \u201cYes, every night.\u201d</p> <p>The Dolomites, named after an 18th-century French mineralogist, are an Italian extension of the Alps that regularly pull in the Adriatic clouds to adorn their stunning peaks and rock formations. Cinque Torri, the Five Towers, is just one clutch of crags that lies on the Alta Via 1, a north-south hiking route that also passes valleys (decked with flowers in season), waterfalls, epic ridges and some fascinating first world war history. Most walkers start in the north at Lago di Braies (spend a night there if possible \u2013 it\u2019s beautiful) and take 10 days to reach the finish at La Pissa, 74 miles away, but there is no reason you couldn\u2019t do it the other way around. It can be done faster, but the terrain is tough \u2013 don\u2019t underestimate it. Some via ferrata (steel climbing fixtures) can be included, which are great fun, but you\u2019ll need a harness and a lanyard.</p> <p>There is no wild camping allowed, but the accommodation is a prime attraction on this route: the stop before Nuvolau (only accessible on foot) is <a href=\"https://www.rifugiolagazuoi.com/index_en.php\" title=\"\">Rifugio Lagazuoi</a>, a larger but equally enjoyable place that sits on an escarpment above a complex network of first world war tunnels. The hut can sleep about 70 and is accessible by a cable car, so it is a lot busier than others, but the atmosphere and panoramas are as good as anywhere. Allow a day to explore the tunnels and trenches. Outside this short honeypot section, you will encounter only a few other hikers and climbers.<br><strong>More details</strong> <a href=\"https://www.visitdolomites.com/page2/alta-via-delle-dolomiti-no-1/?lang=en\" title=\"\">Visit Dolomites</a>; maps: use the <a href=\"https://www.stanfords.co.uk/Italy-Tabacco-25K-Walking-Maps-of-the-Dolomites-and-North-Eastern-Italy_SI00000379\" title=\"\">Tabacco</a> editions; books: <a href=\"https://www.cicerone.co.uk/trekking-in-the-dolomites-fourth\" title=\"\">Trekking in the Dolomites</a> by Gillian Price; <a href=\"https://rockfax.com/climbing-guides/books/the-dolomites-rock-climbs-and-via-ferrata/\" title=\"\">The Dolomites: Rock Climbs and Via Ferrata</a> by James Rushforth<br><strong>Accommodation</strong> Booking at the <a href=\"https://www.dolomiti.org/en/cortina/accommodation/mountain-huts?pageseed=1620661903&amp;amp;page=2\" title=\"\">rifugio</a> is essential<br><strong>Tours</strong> <a href=\"https://www.colletts.co.uk/where/dolomites-i/\" title=\"\">Collett\u2019s Mountain Holidays</a> specialises in the area. <a href=\"https://www.alpineexploratory.com/holidays/dolomites-alta-via-1.html\" title=\"\">Alpine Exploratory</a> does self-guided and guided versions of the complete 74-mile ute</p> <h2><strong>Mount Triglav, Slovenia</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"95a53ca16d3917487b306dca8b3e77c4a43baf72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95a53ca16d3917487b306dca8b3e77c4a43baf72/0_401_6144_3686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mount Triglav in Slovenia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Slovenia\u2019s Mount Triglav \u2013 \u2018a serious lump of rock\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: photography by Enrique Ugarte/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At a mere 2,863 metres, Triglav might seem like an Alpine pimple, but be warned: this is a serious lump of rock, requiring careful preparation, and also home to several of Europe\u2019s most incredible walks. All routes require at least two days for normal mortals; more if you actually want to enjoy the experience. The most demanding ascent is called the Bamberg, and requires nerves of steel on the iron cables. Head for the top of the Vrata Valley and a night in the Alja\u017eev Dom hut. Ahead stands Triglav\u2019s legendary North Face, a near-vertical kilometre of karstic limestone.</p> <p>The Prag route to Krederica hut is easier than the Bamberg, but still requires steady hands up some vertical sections \u2013 all well protected as long as you use the via ferrata correctly. Triglav is a very dry place (except during summer thunderstorms), so bring lots of water. The Bamberg itself takes you through a series of tough vertical pitches, narrow canyons and plenty of exposure, as climbers call it, popping out on a rocky plateau that takes you to Planika Hut for a possible overnight before the final ascent.</p> <p>If you really don\u2019t like the prospect of a via ferrata \u2013 and they\u2019re not everyone\u2019s bag of wire \u2013 try the Krma route, which starts from Kovinarska Ko\u010da hut, rising up to the Krederica hut at 2,515 metres. The final ridge does involve some via ferrata<em> </em>cables, but the summit is in sight and is worth it.<br><strong>More details</strong> <a href=\"https://www.tnp.si/en/visit/\" title=\"\">Triglav national park</a><br><strong>Trips (tours)</strong> <a href=\"https://www.muchbetteradventures.com/\" title=\"\">Much Better Adventures</a> runs various two-night trips to Triglav from \u00a3392, including guides, via ferrata equipment, meals, accommodation and airport transfers</p> <h2><strong>Turnov to Ji\u010d\u00edn, Bohemian Paradise, Czech Republic</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"729c59fb8133a7af901eded5bafa72ff61767020\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/729c59fb8133a7af901eded5bafa72ff61767020/0_257_7700_4622/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Prachovsk\u00e9 Sk\u00e1ly rocks on the Bohemian Paradise route\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Prachovsk\u00e9 Sk\u00e1ly rocks on the Bohemian Paradise route.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Madeleine Steinbach/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Czech Republic has some fine walking routes, but none beats the exquisite labyrinth of sandstone rock towers in the east known as Bohemian Paradise. From the start in the town of Turnov, this feels like moving into a Mitteleuropa of a slower, more ancient vintage: villages that cluster around castles are dotted across a landscape of mountains, meadows and forests. The path heads south and soon begins to bump into isolated rock towers and natural grottoes that become more and more grandiose and dramatic. If they were the fanciful rock follies of some deranged Austro-Hungarian princeling, it would be no surprise, but they are completely natural.</p> <p>At <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jan/26/czech-republic-bohemia-magical-britannia-tv-series-location\" title=\"\">Prachovsk\u00e9 Sk\u00e1ly</a> the geological eccentricity reaches its apogee: this is a baffling playground of towers, canyons and stairways (humans have played a minor role here) that is difficult to leave \u2013 partly because it is so delightful and partly because it\u2019s hard to find the way out. No wonder film location scouts looking for a gothic or medieval fantasy hideout often end up here. Walking north to south is preferable, because you finish in Ji\u010d\u00edn, an imposing old city with a beautiful square and market. However, going in the other direction does open up the possibility of connecting with the <a href=\"https://www.era-ewv-ferp.org/e-paths/\" title=\"\">E3</a> long-distance path.<br><strong>More details </strong><a href=\"https://www.visitczechrepublic.com/en-US/Things-to-Do/Places/Landmarks/UNESCO/c-bohemian-paradise-unesco-geopark\" title=\"\">Visit Czech Republic</a><br><strong>Tours</strong> <a href=\"https://www.onfootholidays.co.uk/routes/bohemian-paradise/?tab=itinerary\" title=\"\">On Foot Holidays</a> does a six-night trip from \u00a3635pp including breakfasts and luggage transfers</p> <h2><strong>France and Spain: </strong><strong>GR10 and GR11, the Pyrene</strong><strong>es</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e994bb7ab8b900b70a4ac07026f85ba6ac06e25e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e994bb7ab8b900b70a4ac07026f85ba6ac06e25e/0_462_7360_4415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The GR11 path in the Spanish Pyrenees\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The GR11 path in the Spanish Pyrenees.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Treadway/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Having warmed up on short hikes like the other five mentioned here, you may be ready to really stride out. For this I suggest the GR10, which traverses the entire length of the Pyrenees, a distance of around 900km. At the end of your 50- to 60-day walk, you will have climbed the equivalent of more than five Everests (about 48,000 metres of ascent). I have done a few sections and it is superb high-country hiking. There are in fact two paths: on the French side of the border is the GR10, the <em>Sentier des Pyr\u00e9</em><em>n\u00e9es</em>, and on the Spanish, GR11, the <em>Senda Pirenaica</em>.</p> <p>Overall, the French side is a slightly easier option: there are more mountain huts and more walkers, while its altitude is slightly lower.

      "bodyText": "Is this bag too heavy? Do my boots pinch? Am I fit enough? Do I look a complete anorak in this cagoule? There is nothing like the prospect of a multi-day, long-distance footpath to rouse lurking anxieties and keep you awake at night for weeks beforehand. And there is always the helpful soul who insists you must take a particular item: a thick hardback volume on the benefits of walking? Lovely. A selection of artisanal cheeses and a bottle of fizz? I\u2019ll squeeze them in somehow. Once for me, in Yemen, it was a pistol, presented with the comforting words: \u201cTake this \u2013 you\u2019re going to need it.\u201d Then, finally, you begin. You are moving and eventually comes the realisation that, assuming you manage the feat of placing one foot in front of the other, you will make it. You dump the hardback book and pistol, scoff the food, quaff the drink; your bag gets significantly lighter. The sun comes out and all the mountains stand before you. With luck, there are no more cars, no power lines or pavements for a long time to come. Within a few hours you are looking back and saying, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve walked so far already!\u201d Within a few days, you say, \u201cI just want to keep going forever.\u201d (There will be moments when you bitterly regret that one.) You have entered the real world, the one you now prefer. You are a long-distance European mountain walker. So here are some ideas, some real walks to be considered. The Malerweg (Painters\u2019 Path), Germany In 1766 two Dresden art teachers, Anton Graff and Adrian Zingg, set off on a trip into Saxony, heading through the town of Pirna, south-east of their home, into a region of mountains, mists and deep valleys that now straddles the border of Germany and the Czech Republic. Other painters, including Caspar David Friedrich, soon followed, triggering a romantic art movement and a love of hiking. In 2006 a new path, the Malerweg or Painters\u2019 Path, opened, a 71-mile circuit that has quickly become a German classic. Normally done over eight days, the walk takes in highlights such as sandstone outcrops and massifs such as the Schrammtor and Schrammsteine, where the trail burrows up narrow canyons, often on ladders, to magnificent views. Don\u2019t bring a massive, wide backpack \u2013 you will get stuck \u2013 but come with sketching gear. There is plenty of accommodation in guesthouses along the path, but there are some campsites, too, and pitching under rock overhangs is tolerated. More details on the official website: Malerweg. Hiking Navigator has a very useful stage-by-stage guide Tours The Natural Adventure Company offers a great self-guided walk of the Malerweg from \u00a3765pp, which includes nine nights in hotels, luggage transfers and breakfasts Alta Via 1, the Dolomites, Italy It was on the Alta Via 1 that I first experienced the magic of the Dolomites. We had hiked up the trail to the Rifugio Nuvolau mountain hut in broad sunshine, but as the day ended clouds came rolling in from the Adriatic Sea, blossoming above the 3,000-metre peaks in dramatic thunderheads that were then slowly torn apart by the wind in the dying rays of a ripening red sun. In many years of mountain walking and climbing I had never witnessed anything like it. Eventually we went inside the hut for a hearty, home-cooked dinner and asked the manager if he\u2019d seen the spectacle outside: he nodded, grinning, \u201cYes, every night.\u201d The Dolomites, named after an 18th-century French mineralogist, are an Italian extension of the Alps that regularly pull in the Adriatic clouds to adorn their stunning peaks and rock formations. Cinque Torri, the Five Towers, is just one clutch of crags that lies on the Alta Via 1, a north-south hiking route that also passes valleys (decked with flowers in season), waterfalls, epic ridges and some fascinating first world war history. Most walkers start in the north at Lago di Braies (spend a night there if possible \u2013 it\u2019s beautiful) and take 10 days to reach the finish at La Pissa, 74 miles away, but there is no reason you couldn\u2019t do it the other way around. It can be done faster, but the terrain is tough \u2013 don\u2019t underestimate it. Some via ferrata (steel climbing fixtures) can be included, which are great fun, but you\u2019ll need a harness and a lanyard. There is no wild camping allowed, but the accommodation is a prime attraction on this route: the stop before Nuvolau (only accessible on foot) is Rifugio Lagazuoi, a larger but equally enjoyable place that sits on an escarpment above a complex network of first world war tunnels. The hut can sleep about 70 and is accessible by a cable car, so it is a lot busier than others, but the atmosphere and panoramas are as good as anywhere. Allow a day to explore the tunnels and trenches. Outside this short honeypot section, you will encounter only a few other hikers and climbers. More details Visit Dolomites; maps: use the Tabacco editions; books: Trekking in the Dolomites by Gillian Price; The Dolomites: Rock Climbs and Via Ferrata by James Rushforth Accommodation Booking at the rifugio is essential Tours Collett\u2019s Mountain Holidays specialises in the area. Alpine Exploratory does self-guided and guided versions of the complete 74-mile ute Mount Triglav, Slovenia At a mere 2,863 metres, Triglav might seem like an Alpine pimple, but be warned: this is a serious lump of rock, requiring careful preparation, and also home to several of Europe\u2019s most incredible walks. All routes require at least two days for normal mortals; more if you actually want to enjoy the experience. The most demanding ascent is called the Bamberg, and requires nerves of steel on the iron cables. Head for the top of the Vrata Valley and a night in the Alja\u017eev Dom hut. Ahead stands Triglav\u2019s legendary North Face, a near-vertical kilometre of karstic limestone. The Prag route to Krederica hut is easier than the Bamberg, but still requires steady hands up some vertical sections \u2013 all well protected as long as you use the via ferrata correctly. Triglav is a very dry place (except during summer thunderstorms), so bring lots of water. The Bamberg itself takes you through a series of tough vertical pitches, narrow canyons and plenty of exposure, as climbers call it, popping out on a rocky plateau that takes you to Planika Hut for a possible overnight before the final ascent. If you really don\u2019t like the prospect of a via ferrata \u2013 and they\u2019re not everyone\u2019s bag of wire \u2013 try the Krma route, which starts from Kovinarska Ko\u010da hut, rising up to the Krederica hut at 2,515 metres. The final ridge does involve some via ferrata cables, but the summit is in sight and is worth it. More details Triglav national park Trips (tours) Much Better Adventures runs various two-night trips to Triglav from \u00a3392, including guides, via ferrata equipment, meals, accommodation and airport transfers Turnov to Ji\u010d\u00edn, Bohemian Paradise, Czech Republic The Czech Republic has some fine walking routes, but none beats the exquisite labyrinth of sandstone rock towers in the east known as Bohemian Paradise. From the start in the town of Turnov, this feels like moving into a Mitteleuropa of a slower, more ancient vintage: villages that cluster around castles are dotted across a landscape of mountains, meadows and forests. The path heads south and soon begins to bump into isolated rock towers and natural grottoes that become more and more grandiose and dramatic. If they were the fanciful rock follies of some deranged Austro-Hungarian princeling, it would be no surprise, but they are completely natural. At Prachovsk\u00e9 Sk\u00e1ly the geological eccentricity reaches its apogee: this is a baffling playground of towers, canyons and stairways (humans have played a minor role here) that is difficult to leave \u2013 partly because it is so delightful and partly because it\u2019s hard to find the way out. No wonder film location scouts looking for a gothic or medieval fantasy hideout often end up here. Walking north to south is preferable, because you finish in Ji\u010d\u00edn, an imposing old city with a beautiful square and market. However, going in the other direction does open up the possibility of connecting with the E3 long-distance path. More details Visit Czech Republic Tours On Foot Holidays does a six-night trip from \u00a3635pp including breakfasts and luggage transfers France and Spain: GR10 and GR11, the Pyrenees Having warmed up on short hikes like the other five mentioned here, you may be ready to really stride out. For this I suggest the GR10, which traverses the entire length of the Pyrenees, a distance of around 900km. At the end of your 50- to 60-day walk, you will have climbed the equivalent of more than five Everests (about 48,000 metres of ascent). I have done a few sections and it is superb high-country hiking. There are in fact two paths: on the French side of the border is the GR10, the Sentier des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, and on the Spanish, GR11, the Senda Pirenaica. Overall, the French side is a slightly easier option: there are more mountain huts and more walkers, while its altitude is slightly lower. Both paths are spectacular, with stunning scenery including the A\u00f1isclo Canyon and the Cirque du Gavarnie. For those without time for the entire hike, these two highlights can be done as day walks. The wildlife is special: chamois, marmots and bears (although you are very unlikely to see one), plus wonderful birdlife, especially during migration periods. As both paths rise above 2,500 metres, they may not open until late June, or even into July, whereupon thunderstorms become a danger.

      "body": "<p>At the beginning of the pandemic, one romantic comedy setup I heard repeatedly (from fellow authors, hoping to wrangle a book deal out of the situation) was the one about the couple who meet on Tinder and have one date in real life, before (for a variety of complicated and tenuous reasons) they have no choice but to move in together because of lockdown. It\u2019s easy to see why this idea was so attractive: it was a ready-made romcom plot. Take two fish, remove them from their water and watch hilarity ensue.</p> <p>Of course, no one ever suggested a happily married couple for this kind of scenario because what fun would that be to read? And yet, over the past two years, I\u2019ve found myself living in a gentle romantic comedy of sorts \u2013 less <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/10/when-harry-met-sally-rerelease-film-review-nora-ephron\">When Harry Met Sally</a>, and more I\u2019d Always Thought You Were My Favourite Human Being But Thanks to Two Years of Covid, I Now Know This for a Fact.</p> <p>In the first lockdown, social media came into its own. When I wasn\u2019t on FaceTime with friends, I was Zooming them, and when I wasn\u2019t doing either of those we would be catching up via <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/10/houseparty-is-over-video-app-that-boomed-in-lockdown-meets-its-end\">Houseparty</a> (remember that?). As the weeks rolled on, however, it became clear that not going anywhere or doing anything was something of a conversation-killer. By the time we had clocked up the first month, barely anyone was interested in talking at all.</p> <p>My wife Claire and I, meanwhile, always seemed to have something to discuss, whether it was guesstimates as to how long this whole thing would go on for, or telling each other anecdotes we had already shared many times across our 25 years together. We even took to conversing at length about the size, shape and solidity (or lack thereof) of our rescue greyhound\u2019s poo (I\u2019m sure fellow dog owners will understand). Unlike when speaking with friends, no topic, no matter how prosaic, was out of bounds with my wife. It was almost as if, unconsciously, we\u2019d both decided that it wasn\u2019t so much what we said in this often-terrifying situation that was important, but rather the fact that we were communicating at all, letting the other know that we were in this together.</p> <p>I know that single male friends of mine found lockdown particularly difficult to handle. So much of our remote communication is functional in nature (Me: Pub? Mate: thumbs-up emoji) and we only really warm up to back-and-forth conversation in person, which, of course, wasn\u2019t allowed. It certainly made me grateful that I had my wife to laugh, cry and yell at the TV with.</p> <p>It was funny how quickly she and I adapted to a world that had changed overnight. Suddenly, date night wasn\u2019t dinner and drinks but rather a walk around the block after dark. A romantic getaway wasn\u2019t a mini-break in Paris, but heading up to bed early several nights in a row to make our way through back-to-back episodes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2009/apr/14/spiral-wire-tv\">Spiral</a>.</p> <p>Several times during the various lockdowns, it occurred to me that perhaps this was a little bit of a glimpse into what our retirement might look like. I\u2019ve always hated the idea of becoming one of those men who take up golf to avoid being around their partner. The pandemic, then, has at the very least shown me two things: that it\u2019s highly likely I\u2019ll spend much of my twilight years in front of the TV or reading books, rather than working on my golf swing \u2013 and that the person I\u2019ll be doing this with will be my wife.</p> <p><em>Mike Gayle is an author and journalist</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "At the beginning of the pandemic, one romantic comedy setup I heard repeatedly (from fellow authors, hoping to wrangle a book deal out of the situation) was the one about the couple who meet on Tinder and have one date in real life, before (for a variety of complicated and tenuous reasons) they have no choice but to move in together because of lockdown. It\u2019s easy to see why this idea was so attractive: it was a ready-made romcom plot. Take two fish, remove them from their water and watch hilarity ensue. Of course, no one ever suggested a happily married couple for this kind of scenario because what fun would that be to read? And yet, over the past two years, I\u2019ve found myself living in a gentle romantic comedy of sorts \u2013 less When Harry Met Sally, and more I\u2019d Always Thought You Were My Favourite Human Being But Thanks to Two Years of Covid, I Now Know This for a Fact. In the first lockdown, social media came into its own. When I wasn\u2019t on FaceTime with friends, I was Zooming them, and when I wasn\u2019t doing either of those we would be catching up via Houseparty (remember that?). As the weeks rolled on, however, it became clear that not going anywhere or doing anything was something of a conversation-killer. By the time we had clocked up the first month, barely anyone was interested in talking at all. My wife Claire and I, meanwhile, always seemed to have something to discuss, whether it was guesstimates as to how long this whole thing would go on for, or telling each other anecdotes we had already shared many times across our 25 years together. We even took to conversing at length about the size, shape and solidity (or lack thereof) of our rescue greyhound\u2019s poo (I\u2019m sure fellow dog owners will understand). Unlike when speaking with friends, no topic, no matter how prosaic, was out of bounds with my wife. It was almost as if, unconsciously, we\u2019d both decided that it wasn\u2019t so much what we said in this often-terrifying situation that was important, but rather the fact that we were communicating at all, letting the other know that we were in this together. I know that single male friends of mine found lockdown particularly difficult to handle. So much of our remote communication is functional in nature (Me: Pub? Mate: thumbs-up emoji) and we only really warm up to back-and-forth conversation in person, which, of course, wasn\u2019t allowed. It certainly made me grateful that I had my wife to laugh, cry and yell at the TV with. It was funny how quickly she and I adapted to a world that had changed overnight. Suddenly, date night wasn\u2019t dinner and drinks but rather a walk around the block after dark. A romantic getaway wasn\u2019t a mini-break in Paris, but heading up to bed early several nights in a row to make our way through back-to-back episodes of Spiral. Several times during the various lockdowns, it occurred to me that perhaps this was a little bit of a glimpse into what our retirement might look like. I\u2019ve always hated the idea of becoming one of those men who take up golf to avoid being around their partner. The pandemic, then, has at the very least shown me two things: that it\u2019s highly likely I\u2019ll spend much of my twilight years in front of the TV or reading books, rather than working on my golf swing \u2013 and that the person I\u2019ll be doing this with will be my wife.

She herself, she once said on stage, grew up with many names, and didn\u2019t know she was called Elizabeth until her first day at school.</p> <p>We Need New Names, published in 2013, was shortlisted for the Booker prize, making Bulawayo the first Black African woman and the first Zimbabwean to feature in the final six. Earlier, what became its opening chapter had won the Caine prize for African writing under the title Hitting Budapest, a reference to the nickname given to a wealthy area by the group of hungry children who go there, from the shantytown called Paradise, to steal guavas. The novel moved from Zimbabwe to its protagonist\u2019s new home in the American midwest, a geographical and cultural journey mirrored by its author, who studied in Michigan and Texas before earning a master\u2019s at Cornell University and being awarded the Truman Capote Fellowship, both in creative writing. Having left Zimbabwe at 18, to join an aunt, it would be 13 years before she visited her home country again, due to her studies and the instability in the country. In previous interviews, she has talked about the beginning of her life in the US as a time of silence, where previously she had been a noisy, gregarious child.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f17271c04b9cc926c003e76af5cd448058e2cf42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f17271c04b9cc926c003e76af5cd448058e2cf42/0_207_4403_2643/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A demonstration in Harare against the Mugabe regime in November, 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A demonstration in Harare against the Mugabe regime in November, 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bulawayo went on to teach at Stanford and elsewhere, but 2017 provided her with an exceptional and pressing reason to return to the country of her birth: the end of Mugabe\u2019s rule, following a coup d\u2019etat that ended with his former deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa, being installed in his place. \u201cBecause it was so momentous, I knew right from the start that there was a story there,\u201d she remembers.

There\u2019s an extraordinary, electrifying moment in Glory when a group of animals, waiting for the results of what is ironically called the #freefairncredible election, are galvanised by news from afar, and gather round a phone to watch footage of a brutal murder carried out by officers of the law in another country: \u201cWe see them talking, the murdered Black body at their feet like a reaped harvest, like a big black bundle of nothing.\u201d The page resolves into the repetition of a single phrase: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p> <p>The murder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/24/george-floyd-death-police-officers-guilty-civil-rights\" title=\"\">George Floyd</a> and the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\" title=\"\"> global protests </a>that followed it prompted Bulawayo to reflect on the links between abuses of power across countries and societies, and on her own responsibility as a writer. \u201cThis is a point in my work where I have to pause and consider how I position myself in relation to the world, and what is happening; to push my art to do more, to be engaged, and to continue to be in solidarity with struggles for all kinds of freedom everywhere.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Western women are also going through their own stuff.

The seismic events of the last few years there, she says, felt disheartening in the sense that they reminded her how \u201cwhat happens in one part of the world can easily happen even to those other parts that think they are better because they have this democracy thing figured out\u201d. But she remains committed to retaining her dual identity. \u201cI fiercely love both countries. It took me a while to own America as home, because it\u2019s a complicated business. I\u2019m an immigrant, I\u2019m not from there. There is a way in which the country, especially during the Trump years \u2013 and really before, but it was certainly amplified then \u2013 can remind you of your otherness, of your foreignness. And that can certainly create a tension in how you see yourself in terms of belonging. But the reality is that I\u2019ve lived in both countries for more or less equal years now. I\u2019ve made my life in both countries, and my life continues to be in both countries. So, it is no longer an option to be detached from one place or the other, no matter how maddening they can be.\u201d</p> <p>Glory is dedicated to \u201call Jidadas, everywhere\u201d, and it is undeniably a powerful celebration of the strength of a united citizenry, of a moment when those living under tyranny decide that they have had enough \u2013 a sentiment that has particular force as we speak, in the immediate aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But it\u2019s also impossible to read it without an awareness of Zimbabwe\u2019s post-Mugabe challenges and, indeed, it is a novel filled with pain and loss. What does Bulawayo feel the future looks like from the present moment? She considers carefully. \u201cAs a writer and as a Zimbabwean, there is a feeling of despair, in the sense that nothing is working,\u201d she says. \u201cI know that\u2019s a totalising way of framing it, but the reality is that the future is not encouraging. And understandably, because those who are in charge of the country are inefficient, they are inept, they are corrupt, they do not care about the lives of ordinary Zimbabweans. And, given what just happened in the last election, it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s going to be easy to remedy the situation. That\u2019s where the despair comes from. That said, it is always important to hope, to be optimistic. I am encouraged by this new generation that wants better, and I think that\u2019s really going to be an important component of us figuring out the way forward, because for you to go somewhere you have to want better.\u201d</p> <p>And what will she be up to? She smiles. \u201cWhat I\u2019m doing next is a whole bunch of relaxing. I\u2019ve been writing since 2017. And this book drained me. I think it\u2019s one of the hardest things I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d And, mindful of the drain not only on her but on her generator, we say goodbye.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Glory by NoViolet Bulawayo is published by Chatto &amp; Windus (\u00a318.99).

      "bodyText": "On the day I talk over Zoom with NoViolet Bulawayo in Zimbabwe, she is relying on a generator to power her internet connection; when she has a tickle in her throat and excuses herself to fetch water, she returns laughing, having forgotten that there is none today, and relieved that her sister has furnished her with a bottle. Ahead of travelling to the US for the publication of her second novel, Glory, she is in Bulawayo, the home city that provides half of her pen name; the other half, NoViolet, links the Ndebele word for \u201cwith\u201d to the name of her mother, who died when her daughter was 18 months old. It was an early loss that, she says, means her writing will always have a strong awareness of how personal lives intersect with larger historical and political forces. \u201cSome of these things that we carry, we don\u2019t sign up for. But we\u2019re here and, you know, everything and anything can happen to us. It\u2019s part of my story. But it also doesn\u2019t define me or define who I am and where I\u2019m going.\u201d Born Elizabeth Zandile Tshele in 1981, the year after Southern Rhodesia became Zimbabwe and Robert Mugabe its first prime minister, Bulawayo has used her work to explore the importance of naming as an act of self-possession, so much so that her debut novel was entitled We Need New Names. She herself, she once said on stage, grew up with many names, and didn\u2019t know she was called Elizabeth until her first day at school. We Need New Names, published in 2013, was shortlisted for the Booker prize, making Bulawayo the first Black African woman and the first Zimbabwean to feature in the final six. Earlier, what became its opening chapter had won the Caine prize for African writing under the title Hitting Budapest, a reference to the nickname given to a wealthy area by the group of hungry children who go there, from the shantytown called Paradise, to steal guavas. The novel moved from Zimbabwe to its protagonist\u2019s new home in the American midwest, a geographical and cultural journey mirrored by its author, who studied in Michigan and Texas before earning a master\u2019s at Cornell University and being awarded the Truman Capote Fellowship, both in creative writing. Having left Zimbabwe at 18, to join an aunt, it would be 13 years before she visited her home country again, due to her studies and the instability in the country. In previous interviews, she has talked about the beginning of her life in the US as a time of silence, where previously she had been a noisy, gregarious child. Bulawayo went on to teach at Stanford and elsewhere, but 2017 provided her with an exceptional and pressing reason to return to the country of her birth: the end of Mugabe\u2019s rule, following a coup d\u2019etat that ended with his former deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa, being installed in his place. \u201cBecause it was so momentous, I knew right from the start that there was a story there,\u201d she remembers.

Bulawayo would wake in the morning, turn on the news, and see that reality was moving more quickly than she could hope to take account of; every new development would complicate or render obsolete a plot line or character. At the same time, she says, Zimbabweans were making frequent use of George Orwell\u2019s Animal Farm to discuss the political situation. Blending that with her memories of her grandmother\u2019s animal-led stories, she decided to forsake the human world entirely. The result is a novel that opens with the citizens of the imaginary Jidada gathering in sweltering heat to celebrate Independence Day under the eye of the Old Horse and his wife, Marvellous the Donkey, their security assured by a retinue of Chosen Ones and a ferocious pack of dogs, the Defenders.

I think I\u2019ve learned that I will never be satisfied; I get to one goal and it becomes irrelevant and I want to do the complete opposite.\u201d</p> <p>Wanting to do the complete opposite is actually the real reason Aitchison is embracing artifice, pretence and naked business-mindedness. She says she is rebelling against what she sees as a recent trend towards authenticity in pop: \u201cOver the past four or five years there\u2019s been this desperate craving of realness from pop stars \u2013 of needing pop stars to be human.\u201d She doesn\u2019t think social media is to blame, though admits that \u201cobviously the more an artist is active on social media, the more \u2018real\u2019 they become, and fans feel like they know who they are\u201d.</p> <p>Instead, she sees it mainly \u201cfrom the media and artists themselves: if I\u2019m not seen as authentic or real, I\u2019m not going to be able to be connected with, or they\u2019re not going to believe me\u201d. It\u2019s a trend that not only encourages a down-to-earth persona among the megastars (see: Ed Sheeran, Adele), but also requires artists to have written their own material in order to be seen to be communicating something of themselves in their work. You only have to witness the recent furore when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/24/taylor-swift-damon-albarn-write-own-songs\" title=\"\">Damon Albarn claimed</a> Taylor Swift didn\u2019t write her own songs to realise how important this is to modern pop; Swift responded that it was \u201cfucked up to try and discredit my writing\u201d, and Albarn issued a grovelling apology.</p> <p>As somebody concerned with pushing pop into the future \u2013 and also something of a contrarian \u2013 Aitchison feels as if she is over this. \u201cI\u2019ve already been authentic for a very long time and I\u2019m interested in the opposite of that, to take songs that have been written for me, to play into this hypersexualised character.

I\u2019ve seen a lot of commentary [online] of \u2018She\u2019s taken it too far \u2013 she really has sold out!\u2019 But people who take it too far are better than people who don\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to feel safe in the hands of musicians I admire, I want to feel like: fuck, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do next.\u201d</p> <p>Aitchison\u2019s previous album, 2020\u2019s Mercury prize-nominated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/16/charli-xcx-how-im-feeling-now-review-show-and-tell-turned-up-to-11\" title=\"\">How I\u2019m Feeling Now</a>, could be said to have gone too far in the \u201cauthentic\u201d direction. Made at her LA home in just six weeks over the first lockdown, it was created DIY-style with help from PC Music founder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/sep/16/ag-cook-the-nutty-producer-behind-the-decades-most-divisive-music\" title=\"\">AG Cook</a> and Bon Iver producer BJ Burton \u2013 and also her fans, who were invited to give feedback on songs as they were being made. She workshopped lyrics with them on Instagram Live and invited them to submit artwork and video ideas. And she chronicled the whole exhausting process with great candour on her social media feeds (a documentary about the process, Alone Together, is coming to UK cinemas next month).</p> <p>Aitchison says collaborating with her fans was a very easy process \u201cbecause I have always really respected their taste. I genuinely feel that there are a lot of similarities between us: we grew up on the internet, my fans are also outsiders a little bit and I feel very much like that. We are very much inspired by queer culture and have been embraced by that community or, in some cases, are part of that community.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes the way you can have the loudest voice as a fan is by being negative about the artist</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She talks about her fans as if she knows each and every one of them personally \u2013 which, considering she has 3.9 million Instagram followers, is clearly impossible. How difficult is it to navigate this large-scale, internet-based relationship? \u201cWhat are you trying to ask? I feel like you\u2019re trying to ask something but you\u2019re not fully asking it,\u201d she shoots back.</p> <p>I am not entirely sure what she means, but it\u2019s clearly a delicate subject. I try again, more delicately. Does she think much about the unusual nature of these fan relationships \u2013 sometimes referred to as parasocial relationships \u2013 where one party has an intimate but completely one-sided knowledge of the other? \u201cTotally, and I\u2019m very much aware that comes with the territory, I think it would be extremely naive to not understand that.\u201d Aitchison knows she is both the focus and also merely a convenient meeting point for like-minded people. \u201cThe artist is the common ground. I\u2019ve had some fans tell me \u2018I found my friend through your music\u2019 or \u2018We met at a show\u2019 or whatever, so there is that connective tissue of me in their relationships.\u201d</p> <p>Still, being at the centre of a huge social media community is \u2013 famously \u2013 not all a bed of roses. With passionate devotion comes a sense of ownership and with that comes criticism \u2013 most vehemently directed at detractors, but also sometimes the artist in question, too. Aitchison admits this discourse can \u201csometimes cause pressure \u2013 well, not pressure, that\u2019s the wrong word \u2013 but sometimes the way you can have the loudest voice in a fan community is by saying something negative about the artist. Unfortunately, we live in a world where positive isn\u2019t really rewarded that much, especially online.\u201d</p> <p>In February, Aitchison wrote a post on Twitter telling her followers that she was stepping back from the platform. \u201cI can\u2019t really handle it on here right now,\u201d she explained, having noticed \u201clately that a few people seem quite angry at me \u2013 for the choices of songs I\u2019ve chosen to release, for the way I\u2019ve decided to roll out my campaign, for the things I need to do to fund what will be the greatest tour I\u2019ve ever done, for things I say, things I do\u201d. Some of the criticism was directed at her new music and some was prompted by her decision to play at the exclusive Las Vegas music festival Afterparty, where tickets are linked to the ownership<strong> </strong>of NFTs \u2013 an event she has since pulled out of.</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t particularly want to talk about the statement, she says, but gamely gives what sounds like a well-rehearsed overview. \u201cI have felt really, really low for the majority of this year so far and that\u2019s actually unrelated to my career, it\u2019s just a general feeling I\u2019ve been trying to deal with. And obviously when you\u2019re feeling low, things that sometimes aren\u2019t really very triggering to you suddenly become triggering. Therefore, reading comments on social media, no matter what they\u2019re about, is sometimes just hard to deal with when you\u2019re already in a low space. It\u2019s not that deep \u2013 if you feel sad don\u2019t read bad things about yourself \u2013 but it\u2019s also so instinctual of humans to focus on the negative and the danger and try and protect yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Has she stayed off social media? \u201cI stuck to it for a week but now I\u2019m very much back on,\u201d she admits. This becomes very apparent in the days after we speak, when she makes headlines for replying to a critical fan. \u201cBitch BYE. I will NEVER understand what possesses people to be such C*NTS online,\u201d went one since-deleted tweet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d00f162827024dd1b9c183c9bee4e906291469b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d00f162827024dd1b9c183c9bee4e906291469b/0_62_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charli XCX\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Born to do it \u2026 an early TV appearance in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Kim/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ultimately, though, Aitchison\u2019s social media break is symbolic of a much bigger shift she dreams of making in her life. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this since I was 16 years old \u2013 I\u2019m going to be 30 in August. I feel like I need to just take time to be a human being and live and maybe not constantly be thinking about music.\u201d Is that something she\u2019s been able to start doing yet? She practically scoffs at the suggestion. \u201cNo, not right now because I\u2019m obviously about to release the album. Maybe after this album.\u201d She muses on the practicalities. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible, because it\u2019s all I\u2019ve done in my life \u2013 this is my life, it\u2019s not something I can dip in and out of.\u201d</p> <p>She may be a self-confessed workaholic, but Aitchison is aware that a golden opportunity to pause is approaching. She describes the conclusion of her Atlantic deal as \u201cthe end of an era, it\u2019s very comparable to completing school\u201d as well as an \u201cin limbo time. I\u2019m not just saying this because I don\u2019t want to tell you: I genuinely don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do next: whether I\u2019m going to sign another deal with Atlantic, whether I\u2019m going to sign with a different major, whether I\u2019m going to go independent.\u201d</p> <p>It is also a chance to look back at the 16-year-old her, who made inroads into the industry by uploading her songs to Myspace, where they gained impressive traction for the time. Now, of course, the sorts of numbers required to get the attention of labels are vastly different: \u201cI did have online success, not really at the level that artists who are signed young now have \u2013 like a million TikTok followers or whatever.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/18/making-music-is-about-making-assets-for-social-media-pop-stars-battle-digital-burnout\">\u2018Making music is about making assets for social media\u2019: pop stars battle digital burnout</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Aitchison is not nostalgic for that less complicated time \u2013 in fact, she welcomes TikTok wholeheartedly, delighted by its power to resurrect older songs and take away some of pop\u2019s blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it time-sensitivity. Last year, her 2017 track Unlock It, overlooked at the time of release, went through a mini resurgence on the platform. \u201cIt felt really cool that Unlock It had that moment because I\u2019ve always loved that song,\u201d she enthuses. \u201cAnd for the record I really love TikTok. In ways, I wish I had only just started my career because I feel like I would absolutely crush on TikTok at<strong> </strong>16; I\u2019d be making TikToks every single day, doing dance routines constantly.\u201d</p> <p>You don\u2019t doubt the teenage Aitchison would have known exactly what to do with 2022\u2019s technology if she\u2019d been handed it in 2008: this restless, pioneering pop star has always been ahead of her time.</p> <p><em>Crash is out now.

As somebody concerned with pushing pop into the future \u2013 and also something of a contrarian \u2013 Aitchison feels as if she is over this. \u201cI\u2019ve already been authentic for a very long time and I\u2019m interested in the opposite of that, to take songs that have been written for me, to play into this hypersexualised character. I\u2019m just interested in doing what is not really wanted right now, which is probably my flaw,\u201d she laughs. It may not be a surefire path to popularity, but isn\u2019t that how artists move culture forward? \u201cTo be honest I think it is and there are a lot of people who are annoyed at me for that. I\u2019ve seen a lot of commentary [online] of \u2018She\u2019s taken it too far \u2013 she really has sold out!\u2019 But people who take it too far are better than people who don\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to feel safe in the hands of musicians I admire, I want to feel like: fuck, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do next.\u201d Aitchison\u2019s previous album, 2020\u2019s Mercury prize-nominated How I\u2019m Feeling Now, could be said to have gone too far in the \u201cauthentic\u201d direction. Made at her LA home in just six weeks over the first lockdown, it was created DIY-style with help from PC Music founder AG Cook and Bon Iver producer BJ Burton \u2013 and also her fans, who were invited to give feedback on songs as they were being made. She workshopped lyrics with them on Instagram Live and invited them to submit artwork and video ideas. And she chronicled the whole exhausting process with great candour on her social media feeds (a documentary about the process, Alone Together, is coming to UK cinemas next month). Aitchison says collaborating with her fans was a very easy process \u201cbecause I have always really respected their taste. I genuinely feel that there are a lot of similarities between us: we grew up on the internet, my fans are also outsiders a little bit and I feel very much like that. We are very much inspired by queer culture and have been embraced by that community or, in some cases, are part of that community.\u201d She talks about her fans as if she knows each and every one of them personally \u2013 which, considering she has 3.9 million Instagram followers, is clearly impossible. How difficult is it to navigate this large-scale, internet-based relationship? \u201cWhat are you trying to ask? I feel like you\u2019re trying to ask something but you\u2019re not fully asking it,\u201d she shoots back. I am not entirely sure what she means, but it\u2019s clearly a delicate subject. I try again, more delicately. Does she think much about the unusual nature of these fan relationships \u2013 sometimes referred to as parasocial relationships \u2013 where one party has an intimate but completely one-sided knowledge of the other? \u201cTotally, and I\u2019m very much aware that comes with the territory, I think it would be extremely naive to not understand that.\u201d Aitchison knows she is both the focus and also merely a convenient meeting point for like-minded people. \u201cThe artist is the common ground. I\u2019ve had some fans tell me \u2018I found my friend through your music\u2019 or \u2018We met at a show\u2019 or whatever, so there is that connective tissue of me in their relationships.\u201d Still, being at the centre of a huge social media community is \u2013 famously \u2013 not all a bed of roses. With passionate devotion comes a sense of ownership and with that comes criticism \u2013 most vehemently directed at detractors, but also sometimes the artist in question, too. Aitchison admits this discourse can \u201csometimes cause pressure \u2013 well, not pressure, that\u2019s the wrong word \u2013 but sometimes the way you can have the loudest voice in a fan community is by saying something negative about the artist. Unfortunately, we live in a world where positive isn\u2019t really rewarded that much, especially online.\u201d In February, Aitchison wrote a post on Twitter telling her followers that she was stepping back from the platform. \u201cI can\u2019t really handle it on here right now,\u201d she explained, having noticed \u201clately that a few people seem quite angry at me \u2013 for the choices of songs I\u2019ve chosen to release, for the way I\u2019ve decided to roll out my campaign, for the things I need to do to fund what will be the greatest tour I\u2019ve ever done, for things I say, things I do\u201d. Some of the criticism was directed at her new music and some was prompted by her decision to play at the exclusive Las Vegas music festival Afterparty, where tickets are linked to the ownership of NFTs \u2013 an event she has since pulled out of. She doesn\u2019t particularly want to talk about the statement, she says, but gamely gives what sounds like a well-rehearsed overview. \u201cI have felt really, really low for the majority of this year so far and that\u2019s actually unrelated to my career, it\u2019s just a general feeling I\u2019ve been trying to deal with. And obviously when you\u2019re feeling low, things that sometimes aren\u2019t really very triggering to you suddenly become triggering. Therefore, reading comments on social media, no matter what they\u2019re about, is sometimes just hard to deal with when you\u2019re already in a low space. It\u2019s not that deep \u2013 if you feel sad don\u2019t read bad things about yourself \u2013 but it\u2019s also so instinctual of humans to focus on the negative and the danger and try and protect yourself.\u201d Has she stayed off social media? \u201cI stuck to it for a week but now I\u2019m very much back on,\u201d she admits. This becomes very apparent in the days after we speak, when she makes headlines for replying to a critical fan. \u201cBitch BYE. I will NEVER understand what possesses people to be such C*NTS online,\u201d went one since-deleted tweet. Ultimately, though, Aitchison\u2019s social media break is symbolic of a much bigger shift she dreams of making in her life. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this since I was 16 years old \u2013 I\u2019m going to be 30 in August. I feel like I need to just take time to be a human being and live and maybe not constantly be thinking about music.\u201d Is that something she\u2019s been able to start doing yet? She practically scoffs at the suggestion. \u201cNo, not right now because I\u2019m obviously about to release the album. Maybe after this album.\u201d She muses on the practicalities. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible, because it\u2019s all I\u2019ve done in my life \u2013 this is my life, it\u2019s not something I can dip in and out of.\u201d She may be a self-confessed workaholic, but Aitchison is aware that a golden opportunity to pause is approaching. She describes the conclusion of her Atlantic deal as \u201cthe end of an era, it\u2019s very comparable to completing school\u201d as well as an \u201cin limbo time. I\u2019m not just saying this because I don\u2019t want to tell you: I genuinely don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do next: whether I\u2019m going to sign another deal with Atlantic, whether I\u2019m going to sign with a different major, whether I\u2019m going to go independent.\u201d It is also a chance to look back at the 16-year-old her, who made inroads into the industry by uploading her songs to Myspace, where they gained impressive traction for the time. Now, of course, the sorts of numbers required to get the attention of labels are vastly different: \u201cI did have online success, not really at the level that artists who are signed young now have \u2013 like a million TikTok followers or whatever.\u201d Aitchison is not nostalgic for that less complicated time \u2013 in fact, she welcomes TikTok wholeheartedly, delighted by its power to resurrect older songs and take away some of pop\u2019s blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it time-sensitivity. Last year, her 2017 track Unlock It, overlooked at the time of release, went through a mini resurgence on the platform. \u201cIt felt really cool that Unlock It had that moment because I\u2019ve always loved that song,\u201d she enthuses. \u201cAnd for the record I really love TikTok. In ways, I wish I had only just started my career because I feel like I would absolutely crush on TikTok at 16; I\u2019d be making TikToks every single day, doing dance routines constantly.\u201d You don\u2019t doubt the teenage Aitchison would have known exactly what to do with 2022\u2019s technology if she\u2019d been handed it in 2008: this restless, pioneering pop star has always been ahead of her time. Crash is out now. Alone Together is in cinemas for one night only on 14 April and shows at BFI Flare, London, 19 March.",

At that time, I wanted to write a new encyclopedia to elucidate new concepts and thoughts that emerge with rapid urbanisation, and to form a new language.

      "bodyText": "What is the energy security strategy? Soaring energy prices are helping to create a cost-of-living crisis, with the average family\u2019s energy bill rising by 54%. The energy price cap has been raised to \u00a31,971 and a further increase is expected later this year, which would take the average household bill to about \u00a32,300. The government has responded by offering a one-off \u00a3200 discount on bills from October, to be paid back over five years. The UK is not alone: energy prices are rising around the world as industries struck by Covid-19 lockdowns resume operations, and energy supplies still need to ramp up after plunging two years ago during the first lockdowns. The war in Ukraine is adding to the problem: Vladimir Putin has used his dominance over EU energy supplies (Russia supplies 40% of Europe\u2019s gas, and 60% of Germany\u2019s) as a weapon of war, and turned down the gas taps by a quarter before the invasion. Putin could tighten supplies still further, and in any case the EU wants to move away from Russian fossil fuels to stem the flow of money to the Kremlin war machine \u2013 Europe has paid more than \u20ac15bn (\u00a312.6bn) for Russian gas, oil and coal since the invasion began. The UK relies less on Russian fuel, which makes up only 3% of UK gas supplies and about 8% of oil, but British consumers will be hit anyway as the price of gas is set by international markets that are badly affected by the war. Now the government is publishing a strategy to secure the UK\u2019s energy supplies and try to dampen soaring costs for consumers and industry. What will be in it? Renewable energy will play a significant role, with the government planning to rapidly increase the goal for offshore wind generation, and relax the planning rules that have prevented onshore windfarms being built in England for most of the last decade. Nuclear power will get a boost, with the government seeking to help investors expand the UK\u2019s reactor fleet. Keeping the UK\u2019s existing nuclear power stations open as long as possible will help provide stability through the current crisis and beyond, but any new reactors are likely to take more than a decade to start producing power. Fossil fuels will also be a big focus for the strategy, with the government seeking to expand the UK\u2019s supplies of gas and oil, pumping more from the North Sea and making overtures to big Middle Eastern suppliers such as Saudi Arabia. New licences for the North Sea, already under way, will be brought forward. What about fracking? The government is leaving the door open to fracking, saying that it could be allowed if health and safety conditions are met, but few in Whitehall see any real future for fracking in the UK. Fracking at scale would require the industrialisation of swathes of the UK\u2019s landscape, would face huge local opposition, would be expensive and would take years to produce any gas. It is not a solution to the current crisis and the carbon dioxide emissions it would generate make it unsuitable for any future crisis. Could we go back to coal? Coal, the dirtiest form of electricity generation, is to be phased out in the UK by 2024. But the government is understood to have made informal contacts to the UK\u2019s remaining coal operators \u2013 EDF, Uniper and Drax, which has converted its boilers to biomass but could feasibly return to coal \u2013 as a contingency. Whitehall sources claim this is only a question of sensibly keeping options open in case of deepening crisis, rather than overtures to a coal renaissance. What will not be in the strategy?

Labour and the Liberal Democrats have also called for one in the UK. Unfreezing the fuel duty escalator would raise billions that could be recycled to the poorest. Petrol taxes have been kept steady since 2010, resulting in an \u00a311bn loss to the Treasury in 2019, and fuel-guzzling SUVs now make up about half of new cars bought. Making public transport free would be a radical move to get people out of cars overnight, and slash petrol and diesel demand while leading to clearer skies, less air pollution and safer roads for walking and cycling. And a nationwide push to insulate every home to decent standards, and install heat pumps in place of gas boilers, would slash the UK\u2019s energy bills and end the need to import fossil fuels from this year if pursued at speed. But these measures have been ruled out by the Treasury and other departments. What is happening to fossil fuel companies? Party time. They are enjoying a bonanza, with BP\u2019s chief boasting his company was a \u201ccash machine\u201d, and his finance chief that he has \u201cmore money than we know what to do with\u201d. Dangerously for the Earth\u2019s climate, they are using this to cement their lobbying power, telling governments they should invest in expanding oil, gas and even coal. But an increasing number of political leaders are seeing the war in Ukraine as a sign that clean, domestically produced renewable energy can bolster national security. What will all of this do to net zero? The government is expected to reaffirm its commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, despite agitation from a small number of rightwing Tory backbenchers and Nigel Farage. Boris Johnson is said to be a personal champion of green issues within the cabinet, and Michael Gove, the secretary for levelling up, spoke out strongly in favour of net zero this week. Are energy prices the only factor behind the cost-of-living crisis? No, the prices of food, clothing and other goods are also rising. Inflation is affecting many countries as economies recover from the Covid-19 recession, and the war in Ukraine has added to pressures, particularly over food as Ukraine and Russia are leading grain and oil exporters. But another factor unique to the UK that is raising prices is Brexit, as imports and exports now face extra costs, paperwork, staff shortages and other barriers.

The match did get closer than one might have expected, with India able to push it into the final over. But eight runs from six balls was always likely to favour Australia, and India would have needed a wicket in that final over to sneak a win. </p> <p>Put most of it down to Australia\u2019s openers, who scored 121 at better than a run a ball to give the rest of their order latitude. Another century partnership followed between the old firm of Lanning and Perry. Mooney has elevated herself to the very top tier of international players in the last three years or so, and finished it off. India\u2019s recovery with the bat was very good, but against this batting line-up, even their big score looked a bit light on a nice batting surface.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-623596868f08ee17b5372870\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-03-19T08:40:46.192Z\">8.40am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>50th over: Australia 280-4 (Mooney 30, McGrath 0)</strong> Beth Mooney is ice cold. Ice cold. This is exactly like her big chase against India in Queensland last September. First ball of the over, advances at Goswami and plonks her over wide long-on for four! Exactly the spot she hits so often when she needs a boundary. A straight length ball from Goswami exactly the ticket. Then Mooney goes through point, drawing a fumble from the fielder thanks to the pressure of Mooney\u2019s pace between the wickets. Two runs. And she finishes it off with a straight hit down the ground for four.

Bottom-handed whack from Mooney finds mid-on. Late cut for one. <strong>Then Lanning picks the gap!</strong> Just like last time.

India had a lot of batters stand up for them today - Mithali and Bhatia set it up, before Kaur came in and dominated, ably assisted by Vastrakar who played her role extremely well. This is certainly looking like the good India have turned up for today\u2019s game, so they will be looking to take that momentum into their bowling innings.

Hopefully Brown has got that out of her system now. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-03-19T01:27:05.392Z\">at 1.27am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-62352dc28f0832c62ade16f2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-03-19T01:13:21.223Z\">1.13am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">WICKET!

Eden Park is a very interesting shaped field and the batters seem to be struggling to decide when they can take two runs - they may settle a bit throughout the game as they get a feel for it. Verma sees out four dots from Schutt - she hasn\u2019t quite got into her groove yet and she\u2019s remaining cautious while she finds her way.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-62352c008f08ee17b53726ba\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-03-19T01:07:44.271Z\">1.07am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>2nd over: India 10-0 (Smriti Mandhana 9, Shafali Verma 1)</strong></p> <p>Darcie Brown gets us started from the southern end after taking a break last game, so she should be rested and and refreshed. Mandhana picks up a run immediately off the hip, but the field cuts it off well to stop her taking more runs.

Mandhana then snaffles the first boundary of the match, with a lovely back foot glance past fine leg. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6235288a8f08ee17b53726a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-03-19T01:03:56.342Z\">1.03am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>1st over: India 3-0 (Smriti Mandhana 3, Shafali Verma 0)</strong></p> <p>Schutt takes the new ball for Australia, a familiar role for her - although Lanning did mix it up and bring her in later in the innings a couple of matches ago. Mandhana goes immediately on the attack, guiding the first ball past the fielders and picking up a quick two to get off the mark. Schutt draws it back with two dot balls to follow and Mandhana then picks up a single on the drive to give Verma her first look at Schutt for the match. Verma can\u2019t get off the mark and Schutt takes two more dots to finish the over.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6235272c8f08ee17b53726a7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-03-19T00:46:40.997Z\">12.46am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One change to each of the teams for this game, with Darcie Brown in for Australia and Shafali Verma returning for India after sitting out their last few matches.

Australia have been dominant, but there have been some incredibly tight and exciting matches among the other teams. No doubt there will have been plenty of eyes on Australia from the other teams as they form plans to bring down the Goliath of the tournament. Can India be the team to finally be their undoing? So far they have been incredibly inconsistent - in some games looking like they had the ability to take out the entire tournament, while in others they\u2019ve appeared unlikely to even make the semi-finals. Which India will turn up today? They put in some very solid ODI performances against Australia late last year, so they will be hoping to channel some of that today. I\u2019m hoping we\u2019re in for an enthralling battle today, so let\u2019s see how it plays out. The toss is due soon and I\u2019ll bring you all the details as soon as we have them.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Australia stay top of the World Cup table with five wins from five starts, ahead of South Africa who they will play on Tuesday before finishing off with Bangladesh. India also play Bangladesh and South Africa in their remaining pool matches, and are sitting in fourth spot hovering above the drop. They will need to win both those matches to qualify for the semi-finals. That\u2019s it from us today, thanks for your company. The unbeaten World Cup streak rolls on, and the biggest ever World Cup chase is completed. The match did get closer than one might have expected, with India able to push it into the final over. But eight runs from six balls was always likely to favour Australia, and India would have needed a wicket in that final over to sneak a win. Put most of it down to Australia\u2019s openers, who scored 121 at better than a run a ball to give the rest of their order latitude. Another century partnership followed between the old firm of Lanning and Perry. Mooney has elevated herself to the very top tier of international players in the last three years or so, and finished it off. India\u2019s recovery with the bat was very good, but against this batting line-up, even their big score looked a bit light on a nice batting surface. 50th over: Australia 280-4 (Mooney 30, McGrath 0) Beth Mooney is ice cold. Ice cold. This is exactly like her big chase against India in Queensland last September. First ball of the over, advances at Goswami and plonks her over wide long-on for four! Exactly the spot she hits so often when she needs a boundary. A straight length ball from Goswami exactly the ticket. Then Mooney goes through point, drawing a fumble from the fielder thanks to the pressure of Mooney\u2019s pace between the wickets. Two runs. And she finishes it off with a straight hit down the ground for four. What a star. 49th over: Australia 270-4 (Mooney 20, McGrath 0) One ball to come in the over as Tahlia McGrath walks out. Meghna Singh bowls a wide, very wide of off stump, but McGrath is so fixated on looking to score that she throws bat at it, having walked across. She hits it straight to backward point along the ground. Dot ball. Australia need 8 from the last over. Well, well, well. Three singles from the over, both Australians trying to beat the boundary riders and failing, before Meghna bowls width. Lanning aims the square drive, trying to beat those backward points, but gets a thick dipping edge. Great catch by Vastrakar diving forward. This is tight! 48th over: Australia 267-3 (Lanning 96, Mooney 18) Lanning thinking about a century perhaps, swishes at Goswami and misses wide of off. Gets the next one, square of the sweeper behind point and they get back for a second run. Goswami persists with that line, and the two backward points are in business. Once they block Lannings shot, twice, three times! Last ball she drives to cover and there\u2019s no run. So she loses the strike, can\u2019t get the ton, and Australia now need 11 from 12. The game matters much more than someone\u2019s milestone, so expect to see Mooney go for it. 47th over: Australia 265-3 (Lanning 94, Mooney 18) Meghna Singh returns with two overs of her allotment left. Been expensive, 57 from eight overs so far. Adds to that with a couple of singles and then a Mooney carve backward of point. Lanning gets strike, then sprints to keep it from the last ball, tapped to cover. 46th over: Australia 257-3 (Lanning 92, Mooney 12) Jhulan Goswami has three overs left and will start that sequence now. Starts with a Lanning run behind point. Brings in a wide slip for the left-hander, but Mooney just taps and runs a single to mid-off. Lanning back-cuts a good line to the deep third sweeper. Bottom-handed whack from Mooney finds mid-on. Late cut for one. Then Lanning picks the gap! Just like last time. The singles, the singles, then Australia\u2019s captain sizes up the gap, gets just enough width, and places it behind point, too square for deep third, too fine for deep cover. 21 from 24. 45th over: Australia 249-3 (Lanning 86, Mooney 10) Crashed by Mooney! Advances at Gayakwad and flat-bats the spinner through midwicket. Takes a fast two followed by a single. Lanning drives a run to deep cover to keep the strike, and Gayakwad finishes with 0 for 48 from her ten overs. Vastrakar took 2 for 43. 29 from 30. 44th over: Australia 241-3 (Lanning 85, Mooney 3) Vastrakar to bowl her last over, and Lanning glides a run to deep third as she has so many times in her long career. Mooney advances and tries to find the boundary through wide long on, but can only get one. Lanning leans back to cut, and there is the sweeper once again. Mooney drops and runs to point. And finally the one to pierce the field comes. Enough width for Lanning to throw her hands through it, her scything square drive, behind point this time for four. Australia need 37 from 36. 43rd over: Australia 233-3 (Lanning 79, Mooney 1) Gayakwad turns one past the edge for the third time today, though this time Lanning plays the line and isn\u2019t at much risk of nicking. Anchored to the crease, she can only dig out the next couple, then Mooney calls her through for a sharp single. Mooney can\u2019t beat the field, and that makes the equation 45 from 42 balls. 42nd over: Australia 232-3 (Lanning 78, Mooney 1) Australia aren\u2019t fazed. Beth Mooney gets off strike first ball she faces. Lanning pulls a half-hearted half-tracker for four, then takes a run to keep the strike. That leaves 46 to win. First over back, another century stand comes to an end for Lanning and Perry. Nine of them now, in their career. The most ever is Rolton and Keightley with ten. Perry gets cramped for room against a high full toss and squeezes it to cover for a catch. We\u2019ll be back on in a few minutes. While we\u2019re waiting, it\u2019s a good time to make some observations about the Lanning-Perry partnership in broader terms. Today they went past 2000 runs together, currently on 2024. There are only five more prolific pairings in women\u2019s ODI cricket. Charlotte Edwards and Claire Taylor, Lizelle Lee and Laura Wolvaardt, Suzie Bates and Amy Satterthwaite, Deandra Dottin and Stafanie Taylor, and Belinda Clark and Lisa Keightley. Most of those are within 500 runs ahead of the Australian pair, except for Clark and Keightley on 3339. Lanning and Perry have batted together 27 times. The other pairings have batted together respectively 58, 51, 52, 59, and 67 times. Lanning and Perry average 101.50 right at the moment. The next best of those above them is 52.17. They only put down the pitch cover, not the whole square, and now they\u2019re taking that cover off. That was sudden. The rain starts coming down fairly heavily. Australia are well ahead of the par score on the rain calculations, 28 runs there. 41st over: Australia 225-2 (Lanning 73, Perry 28) A concussion protocol delay after Perry misses a sweep and pops it up into the grille of her helmet, but she\u2019s fine. The second ball in a row that she was beaten by Gayakwad, who had previously scooted a ball past an attempted cut shot. Only a scampered single from the over. Australia need 53 from 54. 40th over: Australia 224-2 (Lanning 73, Perry 27) Vastrakar has been the standout for India today, batted well and has bowled with heart. Only two singles for her over as she tries to clamp down, but Australia still only need 54 from 60. 39th over: Australia 222-2 (Lanning 72, Perry 26) Sprinting from Perry to start the over, who hits Goswami through point and hares back for the second. The Australians have picked on Harmanpreet in the field all night, taking on her arm. Perry ends the over by nailing a straight drive along the ground that is so well hit that it bursts through the fingertips of mid-on and is barely diverted on its way to the boundary. 38th over: Australia 211-2 (Lanning 69, Perry 19) Perry goes in the air, short of the deep midwicket rushing in. One run. More for Lanning, flicking Rana through fine leg for four, improvising that shot against a decent enough delivery. 67 to win. 37th over: Australia 204-2 (Lanning 64, Perry 17) Good length from Goswami, who has Perry almost feathering a catch behind from a hard-handed drive. India try to crowd Lanning with two backward points, while Goswami bowls outside off stump encouraging Lanning to hit there. 74 to win. 36th over: Australia 201-2 (Lanning 62, Perry 16) For a lot of teams, 81 from 90 balls would be a challenging end to a chase. For these Australians it feels like a foregone conclusion. The pitch is good for batting, some pace and bounce in it, and India have not been able to tighten the snare for any meaningful period of time. Four runs from the Rana over, Australia\u2019s score passes 200. 35th over: Australia 197-2 (Lanning 59, Perry 15) Goswami bowls a Test match line, Lanning throws a one-day shot at it, and gets a safe edge through an empty slip area for four. 81 runs to go. 34th over: Australia 191-2 (Lanning 54, Perry 14) A miscued shot for the milestone, Lanning getting a skew through the off side while trying to work Rana to leg, but it\u2019s safe. The relentless march of Australia\u2019s captain continues. 33rd over: Australia 185-2 (Lanning 49, Perry 13) Goswami comes back on for a tentative bowl: hasn\u2019t done so since three early overs and an ankle problem. The Australians respectfully take a couple of singles. 32nd over: Australia 183-2 (Lanning 48, Perry 12) Meghna Singh has had a bad night. Short and wide again, crashed through point for four. Then draws an error from a short ball but the top edge goes fine for another boundary. Lanning draws near to a fifty. 31st over: Australia 171-2 (Lanning 39, Perry 10) Time for Lanning to have a crack, she decides, with a big slog sweep over backward square leg for four. Shafali Verma in the deep almost gets around to catch that, but not quite. The singles keep coming either side of that shot. 30th over: Australia 164-2 (Lanning 34, Perry 8) Another controlled over from Gayakwad after the break, two singles from it. The required rate is out to 5.7 now and the actual rate has dipped below that. Easy for Australia to make up the gap, of course, but it does at least show that the scoring has slowed. If India could find another wicket then they would be some chance of increasing the pressure. 29th over: Australia 162-2 (Lanning 33, Perry 7) Four for Lanning, carving a cut shot from Sneh Rana\u2019s off-spin. Rana smiles, what more can she do? But she follows up with a much faster straight delivery that Lanning only just keeps out of her pads. Smart bowling. Drinks, with 116 needed to win. 28th over: Australia 156-2 (Lanning 28, Perry 6) Take on the seamer, not yet the spinner. Both players are cautious against Gayakwad, and with Lanning stretching forward to defend, the left-arm spinner once more turns a ball that kicks and just beats the edge of the bat. She\u2019s bowled a couple of pearlers as well as some loose stuff. 27th over: Australia 154-2 (Lanning 27, Perry 5) Lanning wrenches the run rate back Australia\u2019s way as Meghna Singh returns, bowling short and carved away off the top edge through deep third for one four, then smoked out of the middle through point for another. 124 to win. 26th over: Australia 144-2 (Lanning 18, Perry 4) Just the two runs from Gayakwad\u2019s over of spin, and for the first time in the innings the required rate has crept above the current rate at around 5.5 an over. 25th over: Australia 142-2 (Lanning 17, Perry 3) Another bouncer from Vastrakar, this time way over Lanning\u2019s head. Wide. Lanning finds another boundary with her square drive, then Perry is nearly run out after defending back to Vastrakar with a step forward out of her crease. Vastrakar was sharp enough to fire back at the stumps, but just missed, and Perry was snaking her foot back to safety. Halfway point. 136 to win. 24th over: Australia 135-2 (Lanning 12, Perry 2) India slowing things down for a moment, only two from the Gayakward over. Must take advantage of this to press for another wicket, rather than letting these two build. 23rd over: Australia 133-2 (Lanning 11, Perry 1) Perry glides a single to get going, Lanning adds a two and a one. Goswami is back on the field. 22nd over: Australia 129-2 (Lanning 8, Perry 0) A strange shot from Lanning to start the partnership, a little pick-up pull to a ball that was too full and outside off from Rana, just clearing short fine leg. But she gets things moving properly with a classy square drive for four. 21st over: Australia 123-2 (Lanning 2) The good news for India: both the set openers are gone. The bad news: they have brought together the most successful chasing partnership in one-day history, Lanning and Ellyse Perry. Two in two overs! Great ball from Vastrakar. She had bowled that good bumper to Haynes in the previous over, and follows it up with another. Pace, lift, and Haynes flinches at it, playing a pull shot with her eyes off the ball. It takes a little touch of the bat through to Ghosh behind the wicket. 20th over: Australia 122-1 (Haynes 43, Lanning 1) Get rid of Healy, welcome Lanning. The Australian skipper sees out the over, driving a straight single from the last ball. At last, India get something. The off-spinner bowls outside off stump, Healy pulls out the reverse sweep, and clouts it straight to the fielder behind point. Good catch, if a little strange in technique, overhead while down on one knee. Australia\u2019s opening stand has gone at well past six per over, while the required rate is down at five. 19th over: Australia 118-0 (Haynes 41, Healy 71) Short of options, Mithali Raj goes back to Vastrakar. Who bowls a good over, a zippy bouncer in there to Haynes, and only two singles. 18th over: Australia 118-0 (Haynes 41, Healy 71) More trouble for India with Jhulan Goswami limping from the ground. She had some problem with her ankle, got boundary-line treatment, but now is leaving the arena. Sneh Rana gets worked for a single per ball, plus a brace for Healy. 17th over: Australia 111-0 (Haynes 39, Healy 66) More spin as Gayakwad comes back on, and more runs as Healy bashes two sweep shots in a row through square to the boundary. The team hundred comes up at more than six per over. This team is like the Australian men\u2019s teams of 20 years ago, bullying every opponent in cricket terms. Healy sweeps another boundary with more finesse. India get desperate enough to burn another lbw review, this one pitching outside leg stump. 14 runs from the over. 16th over: Australia 97-0 (Haynes 39, Healy 54) One quiet over is all that Sneh Rana gets, as the Australians attack her next. Haynes and Healy both come down the pitch to hit straight, the former picking up four runs, the latter three. India try a review from the last ball of the over, but with the off-spinner bowling around the wicket, the ball hitting Haynes in front of the stumps is going down the leg side. 15th over: Australia 88-0 (Haynes 34, Healy 50) Meghna Singh not enjoying the work of the umpires: wided for a sharp bouncer that wasn\u2019t far over Healy\u2019s head, then an lbw shout turned down. That ball was also too high. Healy charges off for another risky single and again the throw from midwicket misses the stumps. That run is Healy\u2019s 50th for the innings. Drinks. 14th over: Australia 85-0 (Haynes 33, Healy 49) Sneh Rana on to bowl, the off-spinner putting no pace on the ball and getting some drift in the air. Keeps them to two singles from the over. 13th over: Australia 83-0 (Haynes 32, Healy 48) Meghna Singh around the wicket to the lefty, trying something different to Haynes, who nails one cut shot for four but skews another push in the air through cover for a risky run. Survives. 12th over: Australia 76-0 (Haynes 27, Healy 47) Five runs from the Vastrakar over, Healy working a couple of twos around. She hasn\u2019t had much strike lately, so she has quietened down. Haynes could have been run out to start that over, hitting the ball straight to mid-off and running, but Harmanpreet\u2019s underarm diving forward has no pace on it and lobs over the stumps. 11th over: Australia 71-0 (Haynes 26, Healy 43) Meghna Singh returns after the fielding restrictions are lifted, and has changed ends. Richa Ghosh comes up to the stumps to stop the Australians wandering about. Meghna twice bowls wide down the leg side: that\u2019s the last thing India\u2019s bowlers need to add to their effort. Eventually she asks Ghosh to stand back instead, and the only concedes two runs off the bat. 10th over: Australia 67-0 (Haynes 25, Healy 42) \u201cWatch the ball,\u201d Haynes mouths to herself as Vastrakar runs in, and she does so. Vastrakar again proves the most demanding of the bowlers, five in a row on a good length that keeps Haynes quiet, but the final ball drops short and Haynes punishes the pull shot so effectively that it goes to the boundary through through wide long on. 9th over: Australia 63-0 (Haynes 21, Healy 42) Turn past the outside edge for Gayakwad! Gets it past Healy\u2019s outside edge by a micron, and nearly has her stumped too but Healy on the big forward stretch just keeps her back toe anchored. A poor ball to follow though, down leg side again and knocked away fine for three with Goswami eventually saving a boundary with her boot. Drops short to Haynes who carves away four with a cut shot. India can\u2019t stop the scoring. A single follows with a misfield from the bowler, through her hands. 8th over: Australia 53-0 (Haynes 16, Healy 37) Another bowling change with the seam of Pooja Vastrakar, the all-rounder who has made a big impression since touring Australia last September. Big hitter with the bat, but is at least at this stage primarily a bowler. Hits her length, importantly, with an off-stump line and the Australians only score a scrambled single and a sliced two. 7th over: Australia 50-0 (Haynes 14, Healy 36) Australia flying at more than seven runs per over, and Mithali Raj brings on her left-arm spinner, Rajeshwari Gayakwad. Wearing her broad black headband, bouncing up to the crease, usually around the wicket whether to stances right or left. She\u2019s had a good tournament so far, and bowls a good over up until the final ball, which is outside leg stump for Haynes and deflected on the paddle sweep for four. 6th over: Australia 43-0 (Haynes 9, Healy 34) A bit of circumspection from Healy with Meghna Singh bowling wide, swinging it away with the field stacked behind point, making it dangerous to glide the ball away. But when Meghna bowls a similar ball too full, Healy thrashes another cover drive for four. Then nearly runs herself out! Hits it straight to point, Yastika Bhatia I think it was collecting a one-bounce ball, but can\u2019t get rid of the throw quickly enough, taking an extra step to steady herself first. Healy reaches the non-striker\u2019s end, and the ball misses anyway. A faster direct hit would have had her. 5th over: Australia 38-0 (Haynes 9, Healy 29) The Australian keeper is really off to a fast start. Goswami bowls too short to Healy, who cracks a pull shot and then a cut shot to the boundary, back to back. 4th over: Australia 29-0 (Haynes 9, Healy 20) More aggression from Healy against Meghna, as she sees some width. Drives on the up, throws her hands hard at the line, and that means the shot goes in the air through cover. But she gets lucky with the placement and picks up four. Then gets luckier with an outside edge that goes wide of slip for a single to deep third. Against the left-hander the swing bowler is bringing the ball into the pads, startling Haynes with some bounce as well. But Meghna Singh then offers a poor delivery, dragged down hard and bouncing well wide of off stump. Haynes can larrup it over point and get back for three runs. 3rd over: Australia 20-0 (Haynes 6, Healy 14) The Australians are happy to pick off Goswami for modest returns early in the day, knocking singles and a two for Haynes behind square leg. Nothing aggressive. 2nd over: Australia 15-0 (Haynes 3, Healy 12) A good mix of aggression with patience from Healy, seeing out a few balls from Meghna Singh, but putting away an errant ball through fine leg for four, then driving three through cover. 1st over: Australia 6-0 (Haynes 1, Healy 5) We\u2019re off to the races. Jhulan Goswami has the ball in hand, India\u2019s heartbeat, the tall seam bowler who leads the world by a mile in one-day wickets. She hits a good line as she almost always does, and a decent length except when she overpitches one ball for Healy to drive through cover for four. Hello all, thanks Megan for taking us through. That was quite the performance from India, after a campaign that has been hit and miss. The Australians have been mowing down huge totals though, so it\u2019s very much in their reach. Looking forward to the reply. Well, that was a very exciting innings! There were plenty of swings in momentum, with Australia and India both taking the ascendancy at different times. Australia is now chasing 278, which would be a world record run chase in a World Cup if they got there. But the way they have looked this tournament, they\u2019re very capable of making that look easy. India had a lot of batters stand up for them today - Mithali and Bhatia set it up, before Kaur came in and dominated, ably assisted by Vastrakar who played her role extremely well. This is certainly looking like the good India have turned up for today\u2019s game, so they will be looking to take that momentum into their bowling innings. It\u2019s been enthralling match so far and we\u2019re only halfway through it. I\u2019m going to hand you over to my very excellent colleague Geoff Lemon, who will be your tour guide for Australia\u2019s batting innings. It\u2019s been delightful to spend this innings with you, thanks for your company and your emails! 50th over: India 277-7 (Harmanpreet Kaur 57) Jonassen bowls the last over and India are pushing for a strong finish. They\u2019re running hard and pushing for twos, but the boundaries they\u2019d like aren\u2019t coming to them. They can\u2019t find a boundary this over, but they squeeze every run they can out of it, Kaur finishing not out and Vastrakar sacrificing herself, run out from the last ball of the innings. They take the gamble for the last ball of the over and it doesn\u2019t pay off, with Jonassen taking an easy run out, but it was an excellent partnership at the end for India. 49th over: India 269-6 (Harmanpreet Kaur 52, Pooja Vastrakar 31) Schutt takes the penultimate over and Kaur punches the first ball down the ground. Perry comes in to cut it off, but she fumbles it and very nearly gives her a boundary assist. There\u2019s an LBW appeal next ball, but it\u2019s ruled to be going down leg and then Healy has a chance for a direct hit run out at the bowler\u2019s end, but she misses the stumps. Australia decides to review for the LBW, but the umpire made the right call originally and India stay in the fight. Vastrakar has a big swipe at the next ball, putting it in the air over mid off and Healy calls out for a catch, but it falls safely and it\u2019s an easy two. Late in the over she smashes an 81 metre six over long on and finishes with a single. 48th over: India 257-6 (Harmanpreet Kaur 50, Pooja Vastrakar 22) Jonassen thinks she might have an LBW first ball, but the angle isn\u2019t there for that opportunity. A flurry of singles follows and Kaur finishes the over by bringing up her 50 in an excellent effort for her team. 47th over: India 251-6 (Harmanpreet Kaur 47, Pooja Vastrakar 20) Schutt takes this over and India\u2019s run rate has bounced back over five, which she will be looking to pull back. But Kaur isn\u2019t intimidated and as soon as Vastrakar gets her on strike, she pulls a ball that splits the fielders to race over the boundary. Vastrakar pulls one of her own, but she doesn\u2019t quite time it and it\u2019s just a single. Kaur drives another one down the ground, bringing up the 250 for India. Vastrakar mistimes another shot, but she takes another single and they\u2019re keeping the score ticking over, which is so important at this stage of the match. 46th over: India 242-6 (Harmanpreet Kaur 41, Pooja Vastrakar 17) King is bowling her 10th over and Kaur immediately punches the ball straight down the ground, where it evades Mooney to zoom over the boundary for four. She follows it up with another shot down the ground, but this one is just a single to give Vastrakar the strike. Vastrakar is pleased with the opportunity and has seen the way Kaur has been scoring down the ground and decides she wants a piece of that action and drives it down that way for six. King bowls a wide one that is judged too wide, but Healy appeals for a stumping from it. Vastrakar is safely in her crease though and she punches the next one down the ground for four, noticing Mooney has come up and there is space down there. She finishes the over with a single, bringing up 17 from the over 45th over: India 225-6 (Harmanpreet Kaur 36, Pooja Vastrakar 6) The run rate has dropped below five an over and India will need to address that to ensure they put on a defendable total. They\u2019re striking the ball hard, but Schutt continues to bowl well to her field. Kaur shows her intent on the third ball and and urges Vastrakar through for a second run where previously they would have only taken one. India aren\u2019t interested in allowing any dot balls this over and it\u2019s not until the last ball that Schutt gets one. 44th over: India 219-6 (Harmanpreet Kaur 34, Pooja Vastrakar 2) Kaur gets a ball on the toe of the bat on the first ball of King\u2019s over and they run hard for two. She gives them a big opportunity from the second ball with a top edge and Mooney looks like she will take it easily, but she needed to take one more step to secure the ball and she throws her hands at it instead and it slips through her fingers. Kaur will want to use that reprieve and make Australia pay for that drop, but King keeps building the pressure with dot balls and keeps Kaur off strike. 43rd over: India 215-6 (Harmanpreet Kaur 31, Pooja Vastrakar 1) Jonassen has immediate impact and removes Rana from the first ball and Vastrakar gets off strike after a couple of attempts, knowing Kaur needs to face as many balls as possible to finish this innings. On the final ball of the over she sweeps hard for a single to hold on to the strike. Jonassen strikes immediately at the start of her second spell, beating Rana\u2019s bat and sending her on her way for just the one run. 42nd over: India 213-5 (Harmanpreet Kaur 30, Sneh Rana 1) King strikes from the first ball of the over, dismissing Richa and bring Sneh Rana to the crease. Rana takes a few balls to settle in as Australia looks to keep her on strike, knowing how dangerous a set Kaur can be. They do a good job of it for three balls and then Rana manages to get down the other end from a leg bye, but Kaur can\u2019t score from the final ball. Richa knows she has to go hard, so she comes charging down the wicket, but King spins it past her and Healy\u2019s quick hands take the bails off before Richa even knows the ball has gone past. 41st over: India 212-4 (Harmanpreet Kaur 30, Richa Ghosh 8) We\u2019re into the last 10 overs and McGrath starts it with a low full toss, which is a gift to Kaur who sends it to the boundary for four. She takes a single from the next ball to get Richa on strike. McGrath offers a half volley to Richa and Kaur pushes her for two and they run well to make it. Kaur finishes the over with another sweep shot and this one goes all the way to the boundary for four. The run rate is creeping up and India will be working hard to keep it moving in that direction. 40th over: India 200-4 (Harmanpreet Kaur 21, Richa Ghosh 5) King resumes her spell and she will be buoyed by that wicket of Mithali. She\u2019ll have her eye on Kaur next, who is Australia\u2019s big concern heading into the final overs of the match. Kaur pulls out her sweep shot as soon as she gets on strike, but it only results in a single. Richa plays a clever scoop that almost makes it to the boundary and it should have been three runs, but they don\u2019t communicate well enough and it\u2019s only two. 39th over: India 196-4 (Harmanpreet Kaur 20, Richa Ghosh 2) India have brought their run rate up about five an over now and they will be looking to keep pushing that up. Their intent is clear from the first ball of Schutt\u2019s over as they turn what would have been a one at other points in this match into two. There\u2019s a big appeal for LBW on the second ball of the over. The umpire isn\u2019t interested, but Lanning decides to review. However the video shows that the ball clipped Kaur\u2019s glove and the umpire\u2019s decision stands. Healy goes for a stumping next ball, but Richa is well in her crease. A mix up with the running next ball nearly results in a run out, but McGrath hesitates on the throw and Richa is safe. It\u2019s a good over from Schutt, creating plenty of chances. 38th over: India 191-4 (Harmanpreet Kaur 17, Richa Ghosh 1) Another almost chance from the first ball of King\u2019s over, but again it falls short and Brown can only collect it on the bounce. King eventually strikes, removing the dangerous Mithali, which will be a big relief to the Australians late in this innings. Richa Ghosh comes to the crease and gets off the mark immediately, followed by Kaur taking a four and a single to finish the over. Finally Australia picks up the wicket of Mithali, who has been so important for India this innings. King gets her first wicket for the match and it\u2019s another easy catch for Perry at deep midwicket from a slog sweep that Mithali can\u2019t quite get under control. 37th over: India 185-3 (Harmanpreet Kaur 11, Mithali Raj 68) Schutt comes back on to bowl now. She didn\u2019t take a wicket from her first spell, but she bowled well and kept the scoring low in the power play, so now may be her chance to strike if she is able to frustrate the batters by accumulating some dot balls. Singles from the first two balls tell us that the Indian batters aren\u2019t prepared to let that happen. A bit of a wayward shot from Mithali on the third ball looks like it might be a chance, but there are no fielders there to pick up a catch. Kaur plays a nice little scoop to fine leg, but a fielder is there to cut it off before it gets to the boundary. 36th over: India 181-3 (Harmanpreet Kaur 9, Mithali Raj 66) King returns to the attack and Mithali goes after her straight away, with an aggressive sweep, but it doesn\u2019t clear the field and she just gets a single. Kaur comes to the party with her first boundary of the match - her trademark sweep shot past deep square leg for four. There\u2019s a chance for a caught and bowled with a leading edge late in the over, but it falls just short of King. 35th over: India 176-3 (Harmanpreet Kaur 5, Mithali Raj 65) We\u2019re getting into crunch time for India now and Kaur will need to start matching Mithali and lifting the run rate now she has had a few overs to get her eye in. She starts the over with a single from Perry and Mithali keeps the strike rotating to give Kaur another shot. She plays a nice cut shot, but it\u2019s straight to the fielder. She doesn\u2019t look in any hurry just yet, but we know she has the power to go hard late in the innings. A pull shot from the next ball looks much more aggressive and she gets a run from this one, before Mithali plays a very fine one down to hold on to the strike for the next over. 34th over: India 172-3 (Harmanpreet Kaur 3, Mithali Raj 63) Lanning continues with Brown, which is unsurprising as they would love to take another wicket and Brown is certainly the one they\u2019ll be looking to for that. A shorter ball early in the over strikes Kaur on the arm and ricochets into her helmet, but her arm took a lot of the impact and she isn\u2019t troubled by it. Brown is keeping her line very tight, she\u2019s certainly been the pick of the Australian bowlers today, even aside from the three wickets. But Mithali reads her beautifully from the last ball of the over, timing a ball perfectly to beat Perry on the boundary. 33rd over: India 166-3 (Harmanpreet Kaur 2, Mithali Raj 57) Perry is back into the attack at the other end - will she have better control this time around? At this stage I think she\u2019d be happy with a six ball over instead of the 12 ball over she bowled last time around. She starts well and she prefers bowling to right handers, so this partnership will suit her better. Kaur gets off the mark, but Perry is only giving away singles, bowling well to her field. It\u2019s a good over from Perry, she will take a lot of confidence from that after her over to forget earlier in the match. 32nd over: India 162-3 (Harmanpreet Kaur 0, Mithali Raj 56) Brown continues and Mithali chips one over the field, but it doesn\u2019t get past the field and it\u2019s just a single. But two balls later she lures Bhatia perfectly and picks up her third wicket. Mithali finds some space late in the over, but it\u2019s a beautiful save on the boundary from Schutt. Jack Jorgensen however, disregarded my request for wrong answers only and has decided to give us a sensible suggestion. Hi Megan, Is Nasser commentating on Aus / Pak Men\u2019s Tests? I think that might be Rob Key\u2019s voice that sounds very similar to Nasser\u2019s. Go Aus! Cheers, Jack It\u2019s not what I was looking for, but helpful nonetheless. Thanks for your wisdom Jack. Drinks are on the field, so we have time to look at some answers to Kate Poole\u2019s question. Hullo Megan Maurice, With re: Nasser Hussein appearing hither and thither, OBO 16-17 AUS-IND, me buddies have pondered over several theories, and have now finalised the likelihood that: Hussein is most definitely in tropical West Indies. Why would he be in the Land of Long White Clouds where the bones chill? Hussein has learnt the ancient art of assembling himself, just like the Indian Fakirs of yore did, from one place to another. Or it could be mirrors! Hope this answers Kate Poole\u2019s query. Be that it may, it is most enjoyable following the OBOs, so long \u2018ere may this continue! Bik M\u2019Path I\u2019m a big fan of these answers, excellent work, thank you for your input. Finally Australia get their breakthrough and it\u2019s no surprise that it\u2019s Brown who manages it! Bhatia mistimes her drive and it\u2019s a very easy catch for Perry at deep point. 31st over: India 157-2 (Yastika Bhatia 59, Mithali Raj 51) Well now is the traditional point where teams start to go big and push up their run rate. Let\u2019s see what India have in store with this very good partnership in place and plenty of wickets in hand. They run hard on the first ball, but Bhatia gets a ball to the helmet from the throw back and we pause while the necessary checks are done. She\u2019s all good and Gardner sends down another two wides, taking Australia\u2019s wide total to 23 for the match. Next ball Bhatia brings up her 50 with a wonderful shot past deep square leg for four. She tries something similar on the other side of the wicket next ball, but can\u2019t quite get hold of it. She looks to go down the ground after that, but that shot isn\u2019t on either, but eventually she is able to take advantage of a McGrath misfield to pick up two runs. On the final ball of the over she brings out an absolute delight of a shot, turning her wrists to get it extremely fine down to the boundary - it\u2019s beautiful to watch. 30th over: India 144-2 (Yastika Bhatia 49, Mithali Raj 50) There was some nervousness about the weather prior to this game starting, but the sun is shining brightly now and Darcie Brown is back into the attack - the only Australian bowler who has taken wickets so far today. Again the Indians are playing just lovely looking shots, but so often they\u2019re only bringing one run. The Australians are bowling to their field very well, but they\u2019ll want to take some more wickets soon. Mithali brings up her half century late in the over, setting up a great platform to launch from late in this innings. 29th over: India 141-2 (Yastika Bhatia 48, Mithali Raj 48) Bhatia is on the charge now against King with a slog and it looks like a six, but it bounces just in front of the rope for a very nice four instead. There\u2019s a little bit of a collision between King and Mithali on the third ball of the over as King dives to save a ball going past her and Mithali wants to get back in her crease quickly. But there\u2019s no harm done and they\u2019re both fine to play on. The Indians are looking very settled now, bringing up their highest ever third wicket partnership against Australia in this over. 28th over: India 135-2 (Yastika Bhatia 43, Mithali Raj 47) Jonassen comes back into the attack now, with a change of ends. Bhatia looks very confident to start with a scoop to fine leg, before Mithali brings up the 100 partnership with a lovely sweep next ball. This is only the eighth 100 partnership that Australia have conceded in a World Cup match, so a very fine effort from these two. Mithali celebrates with a powerful six down the ground next ball. 27th over: India 126-2 (Yastika Bhatia 41, Mithali Raj 40) Bhatia plays one straight back past King to start the over, but Haynes is out in the deep to save the boundary. The field moves in a bit for Mithali, but she takes a quick single and hands the strike back to Bhatia. It\u2019s a good over from King, just the three singles from it. 26th over: India 123-2 (Yastika Bhatia 39, Mithali Raj 39) Bhatia looks assertive, if not aggressive, against McGrath straight up with a back foot steer to third. Mithali then plays a very nice drive to third that should have got her three runs, but Bhatia hesitates a little and they can only get two. McGrath joins the wide party and luckily Healy gets a glove on it, because it looked to be heading for the boundary. Bhatia cuts hard on the last ball of the over and it pierces the infield, but can\u2019t get past the outfield. 25th over: India 115-2 (Yastika Bhatia 37, Mithali Raj 35) King takes her second over as we approach the halfway point of this innings. She has Mithali\u2019s measure early, starting with four dot balls and keeping her line very tight. The fourth is a little quicker and Healy thinks it might get past Mithali, but she plays it safely. She finally gets off strike next ball and Bhatia takes a quick single from the last. 24th over: India 113-2 (Yastika Bhatia 36, Mithali Raj 34) Tahlia McGrath changes ends and comes from the southern end this time, starting just as consistently as she did from the northern end. Mithali slashes one away from the third ball of the over, getting the Australians interested in a catch, but it falls safely and is picked up by Haynes to keep it to two runs. There\u2019s a run out opportunity a few balls later but Bhatia manages to hurry back into her crease in time. She then punches one down the ground for four in very confident style. 23rd over: India 104-2 (Yastika Bhatia 30, Mithali Raj 31) Alana King enters the attack for the first time this match, the seventh Australian bowler used so far today. She starts with a wide, but the next ball is better and Bhatia just manages a single from it. Her next three balls are good, but a fumble in the field from Jonassen gives away a single just as King as building some pressure. 22nd over: India 101-2 (Yastika Bhatia 29, Mithali Raj 30) Mithali takes her opportunity straight away from Gardner\u2019s next over, guiding the ball beautifully past third for a boundary straight away. Gardner fights back with three dot balls and then Mithali gets one through the covers that races away, but the fielders restrict her to three. 21st over: India 93-2 (Yastika Bhatia 28, Mithali Raj 23) Mithali looks to go that bit harder to start McGrath\u2019s over and it\u2019s in the air, but falls just short of King. She\u2019s looking more aggressive this over, but isn\u2019t getting the ball past the field. But both batters are keeping the runs coming and the strike rotating and aren\u2019t allowing Australia to accumulate too many dot balls against them. 20th over: India 90-2 (Yastika Bhatia 27, Mithali Raj 21) Gardner and Healy both thought the first ball was going to clip leg stump, but it just misses and there\u2019s a single from the next ball. Again India are just rotating the strike and keeping up a decent run rate of 4.5 but as this partnership is settled, the time to go harder will arrive soon. 19th over: India 86-2 (Yastika Bhatia 26, Mithali Raj 20) McGrath continues, looking to keep up her tight bowling and she starts well, bowling excellently to her field. Bhatia is playing some nice shots, but the fielders are cutting them off every time. Eventually she gets one away, but it\u2019s just a single to deep square leg. Mithali goes again for her favourite little pocket of the ground at deep extra cover, but she can\u2019t get it past Schutt. 18th over: India 83-2 (Yastika Bhatia 25, Mithali Raj 18) Another over for Gardner and she\u2019s coming over the wicket. India will want to start getting a hurry on before too long, it looks like a good batting wicket and a fast outfield and we know how much batting power Australia has and how good they are at chasing. Gardner gives away two wides late in the over, with 18 wides now bowled by Australia so far this match. She finishes with a much tighter line. 17th over: India 76-2 (Yastika Bhatia 23, Mithali Raj 18) Tahlia McGrath gets her first over now and she starts it very well, with four dot balls. Bhatia is eyeing her cautiously and is happy to block it out for a few balls before taking a single and handing the strike to Mithali. A good over from McGrath, just the one from it. While we take a quick break for drinks, Kate Poole poses an interesting question via email. Where in the world is Nasser Hussein? I have theories on how he is managing to commentate for both women\u2019s World Cup and Aus/Pakistan men\u2019s tests 1) he has a prototype transporter 2) he has an identical twin and they\u2019ve been fooling the whole world for decades, sneakily changing places when no one is watching. Sure, the answer is likely that the commentary team is remote for one or both competitions, however I find this explanation somewhat dissatisfying. If you\u2019ve got a theory, drop it in a tweet or email - wrong answers only. 16th over: India 75-2 (Yastika Bhatia 22, Mithali Raj 18) Gardner takes another over and starts it well, with four dots on the trot. She\u2019s getting through the overs nice and quickly as well, which will please Lanning. Mithali plays a lovely shot on the fifth ball of the over, but she can\u2019t get it past the field. It\u2019s a maiden from Gardner. 15th over: India 75-2 (Yastika Bhatia 22, Mithali Raj 18) Another over for Jonassen, coming over the wicket to start. Bhatia is rotating the strike nicely at the moment, but the Indians aren\u2019t going too hard yet, just taking the opportunities when they arise, not pushing the strike rate too much. Mithali finds one of those opportunities from the fourth ball, finding another one of those weird pockets of the ground past a quick outfield for a boundary. She decides she quite likes the weird pocket and sends it straight back there, but this time it\u2019s just three runs, well fielded by Tahlia McGrath. 14th over: India 67-2 (Yastika Bhatia 21, Mithali Raj 11) Well we have our answer - Perry is going to take a break and Gardner takes over from her end. This serves the dual purposes of giving Perry some time to get her head back in the game and speeding up the over rate with spin from both ends. Some lovely touch from Mithali from the third ball races away past third for four. It\u2019s a good over from Gardner aside from that, with no other scoring opportunities apart from the boundaries. 13th over: India 63-2 (Yastika Bhatia 21, Mithali Raj 7) Jonassen returns for her second and Mithali pulls her nicely for a single from the second ball to get the more prolific Bhatia on strike. Perry\u2019s over took nine minutes to bowl, so it\u2019s lucky they\u2019ve got spin from the other end to get it through a bit more speedily. This is a much tidier over, only the three from it. 12th over: India 60-2 (Yastika Bhatia 20, Mithali Raj 5) Ellyse Perry comes into the attack for the first time today. She has been in great form with the ball lately, can she continue today? She doesn\u2019t get her line quite right from the first ball, but it doesn\u2019t cost her as Bhatia can\u2019t get bat on it. Her second ball is a wide and then Bhatia puts one away very fine for four. Her next ball is another wide and this is really bringing back memories of the India series last year when she couldn\u2019t seem to control her line. She drags it back in next ball and only gives away a single. But then another wide follows - it will be interesting to see if Lanning gives her another over after this or gives her a break to get her head back into it. A dot and a single show she\u2019s got her line in better shape and she finishes the over by coming around the wicket and giving away five wides, so she\u2019ll have to bowl it again. Lanning has a little word to her before she bowls it, but it\u2019s yet another wide. Her radar just isn\u2019t there right now. And there is another wide - she decides to come back over the wicket and finally she finishes the over. 11th over: India 44-2 (Yastika Bhatia 15, Mithali Raj 4) We get our first look at some spin for today, with Jess Jonassen coming into the attack after the power play has ended. Bhatia glances it nicely to fine leg for two from Jonassen\u2019s first ball and backs it up with a single. Mithali plays it patiently, but isn\u2019t as cautious as she was with Brown and only lets one dot ball accumulate before she takes a quick single. Bhatia is tempted into a big shot from the last ball of the over and top edges the ball in Perry\u2019s direction, but it falls just short and she\u2019s safe. 10th over: India 39-2 (Yastika Bhatia 11, Mithali Raj 3) An edge from Bhatia starts the over, but it falls safely wide of Lanning in slip to give Bhatia a single. Mithali continues in her unhurried manner, not wanting to be lured in by Brown to send a catch to the fielders as her two openers were. It\u2019s a very tidy over from Brown, just the one from it. 9th over: India 38-2 (Yastika Bhatia 10, Mithali Raj 3) A fifth over straight for Schutt, Lanning is clearly happy with what she\u2019s getting from her opening bowlers. Bhatia again starts with two really nice looking shots, but they can\u2019t penetrate the field. On the third ball she times one perfectly with her cut shot and gets the ball down to one of those weird pockets of the field and across the boundary for four. Schutt fights back with two dot balls and Bhatia hurries through for a single on the last to retain the strike. 8th over: India 33-2 (Yastika Bhatia 5, Mithali Raj 3) Brown comes on for her fourth over, bowling to Mithali, who is 20 years her senior. Brown was born four years after Mithali made her ODI debut, so this is quite a match up. Brown gives away another wide on the fourth ball of the over and Mithali sees her opportunity after that with a beautiful shot through covers for two. Brown finishes the over with two very good balls. 7th over: India 30-2 (Yastika Bhatia 5, Mithali Raj 1) Mithali Raj hasn\u2019t been in top form with her batting, so it will be interesting to see what she can do today. Bhatia gets her on strike after three balls and Mithali doesn\u2019t look in too much of a hurry, just taking a single from the final ball of the over. 6th over: India 28-2 (Yastika Bhatia 4, Mithali Raj 0) Another over for Brown and Bhatia plays some very nice looking shots to start, but she can\u2019t quite get them past the field. On the third ball of the over, she finally finds a gap, but doesn\u2019t quite time it perfectly and it\u2019s just a single. Brown looks to intimidate Verma with a short ball immediately when she comes on strike after Verma finished the previous over so dominantly. It pays off when she takes Verma\u2019s wicket on the final ball of the over Once again, just as a batter was getting into their stride, they play a loose shot and exit early. Verma was looking destructive, but Brown bowled perfectly to her, forcing Verma into a late cut outside off that goes to Mooney for an excellent catch at gully. 5th over: India 27-1 (Yastika Bhatia 3, Shafali Verma 12) Schutt back for her third over and she starts with a good, tight line. Verma takes a single from the second ball to get Bhatia back on strike and she immediately guides one through the field for another single. Verma gets sick of the singles and brings out a powerful shot back over Schutt\u2019s head for six and is looking much more like the Verma we know and love. Off the next ball she steers the ball through a gap in the field, timed perfectly to get it to the boundary for four. She\u2019s really coming into her own now. 4th over: India 15-1 (Yastika Bhatia 2, Shafali Verma 1) Brown looks to make up for her ordinary first over and she does immediately, with the big wicket of Mandhana, bringing Yastika Bhatia to the crease. Bhatia uses the first ball to get her eye in, before a well run two off the next ball to get off the mark quickly. Brown gives away the first extra of the match with a wide, followed by a dot ball and then another wide. This has shades of Australia\u2019s series against India late last year when they just couldn\u2019t stop bowling wides. Hopefully Brown has got that out of her system now. Well that\u2019s not what India want to see - Mandhana looked the much better of the two openers and they will have been depending on a big score from her. Brown sends down a length ball that sits just outside off stump and Mandhana edges it to second slip. 3rd over: India 11-0 (Smriti Mandhana 10, Shafali Verma 1) Schutt returns and starts with a good length ball that Mandhana can\u2019t quite get away, but she picks up a single from the second ball. Eden Park is a very interesting shaped field and the batters seem to be struggling to decide when they can take two runs - they may settle a bit throughout the game as they get a feel for it. Verma sees out four dots from Schutt - she hasn\u2019t quite got into her groove yet and she\u2019s remaining cautious while she finds her way. 2nd over: India 10-0 (Smriti Mandhana 9, Shafali Verma 1) Darcie Brown gets us started from the southern end after taking a break last game, so she should be rested and and refreshed. Mandhana picks up a run immediately off the hip, but the field cuts it off well to stop her taking more runs. Verma gets off the mark next ball with a little inside edge that is fielded by Perry at deep square leg. Mandhana then snaffles the first boundary of the match, with a lovely back foot glance past fine leg. 1st over: India 3-0 (Smriti Mandhana 3, Shafali Verma 0) Schutt takes the new ball for Australia, a familiar role for her - although Lanning did mix it up and bring her in later in the innings a couple of matches ago. Mandhana goes immediately on the attack, guiding the first ball past the fielders and picking up a quick two to get off the mark. Schutt draws it back with two dot balls to follow and Mandhana then picks up a single on the drive to give Verma her first look at Schutt for the match. Verma can\u2019t get off the mark and Schutt takes two more dots to finish the over. One change to each of the teams for this game, with Darcie Brown in for Australia and Shafali Verma returning for India after sitting out their last few matches. Australia will of course be looking to erase the memories of the 2017 World Cup, when Harmanpreet Kaur scored 171 in the semi-final against Australia to propel India to victory and send Australia to a shock early exit from the tournament. As much as the team claim this game doesn\u2019t play on their minds and they are a new team now, it\u2019s likely still sitting in the backs of the minds of the senior players and coaching staff who were involved with that game. Smriti Mandhana Shafali Verma Yastika Bhatia Mithali Raj (c) Harmanpreet Kaur Richa Ghosh (wk) Sneh Rana Pooja Vastrakar Jhulan Goswami Meghna Singh Rajeshwari Gayakwad Alyssa Healy (wk) Rachael Haynes Meg Lanning (c) Ellyse Perry Beth Mooney Tahlia McGrath Ashleigh Gardner Jessica Jonassen Alana King Megan Schutt Darcie Brown What a surprise, Meg Lanning won the toss and decided to chase! Who would have ever seen this coming? Lanning sees India as dangerous for them, with plenty of world class batters, so they are hoping to get off to a good start with the ball. Meanwhile Mithali Raj has been working on building her team\u2019s confidence, knowing they are capable of beating anyone on their day. Well here we are once again and what an excellent World Cup it\u2019s been so far! Australia have been dominant, but there have been some incredibly tight and exciting matches among the other teams. No doubt there will have been plenty of eyes on Australia from the other teams as they form plans to bring down the Goliath of the tournament. Can India be the team to finally be their undoing? So far they have been incredibly inconsistent - in some games looking like they had the ability to take out the entire tournament, while in others they\u2019ve appeared unlikely to even make the semi-finals. Which India will turn up today? They put in some very solid ODI performances against Australia late last year, so they will be hoping to channel some of that today. I\u2019m hoping we\u2019re in for an enthralling battle today, so let\u2019s see how it plays out. The toss is due soon and I\u2019ll bring you all the details as soon as we have them.",

      "body": "<p>Armed conflict, especially when fought against a more powerful enemy, produces the loftiest national rhetoric. It keeps our spirits up, and we tend to remember the best bits. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/zelenskiy-invokes-churchill-calls-on-uk-do-more-help-ukraine\">In his speech</a> to the Westminster parliament last week, Volodymyr Zelenskiy echoed Churchill\u2019s \u201cWe shall fight on the beaches\u201d passage from his post-Dunkirk oration, but the Ukrainian president might just as appositely have referenced one of Britain\u2019s most hostile critics.</p> <p>\u201cThese are the times that try men\u2019s souls,\u201d the English radical and American patriot Thomas Paine <a href=\"https://www.ushistory.org/paine/crisis/c-01.htm\">wrote in 1776</a>, when the American revolutionary war was only a year old and its outcome far from certain. \u201cThe summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country,\u201d Paine continued, \u201cbut he that stands by it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered: yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.\u201d</p> <p>The words began Paine\u2019s essay in a pamphlet \u2013 the first of 16 \u2013 that he hoped would inspire and sustain the colonists\u2019 opposition to London rule. Like a lot of rhetoric, it includes nonsense more apparent today than when it was first heard or read. King George III is now nobody\u2019s idea of a tyrant, and when Paine compares London\u2019s oppressive regulation to slavery \u2013 if it isn\u2019t slavery, he says, then \u201cthere is not such a thing as slavery upon Earth\u201d \u2013 he reveals a remarkable blindness to the real, non-metaphorical chattel slaves who underpinned so much of the American economy. Still, \u201cthe summer soldier and the sunshine patriot\u201d is a memorable phrase, the prose has an appealing rhythm, and, not the least of their attractions, the titles of the pamphlets place them firmly in the modern age. Some were called The American Crisis and others simply The Crisis. A more urgent era had begun.</p> <p>The word itself is ancient \u2013 from the Greek <em>krisis</em> meaning decision, used by Hippocrates to describe the turning point in the progress of a disease that leads either to recovery or death. By the 17th century its usage had begun to spread beyond medicine. In 1627, Sir Benjamin Rudyerd MP, <a href=\"http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1604-1629/member/rudyard-sir-benjamin-1572-1658\">trying to mediate</a> between Charles I and parliament, spoke of the \u201ccrisis of parliaments;<em> </em>by this we shall know whether parliaments will live or die\u201d. Astrologers were soon using the word to describe a conjunction of the planets that was critical to human affairs. Gradually, it came to mean something more prolonged than a life-or-death moment. The factory owner and social reformer Robert Owen edited a <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_crisis_or_The_change_from_error_and.html?id=Cf-zcQAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y\">short-lived newspaper</a>, The Crisis, that promoted \u201cthe change from error and misery to truth and happiness\u201d, while Marx and Engels in the Communist Manifesto describe \u201ccrises that by their periodical return put the existence of the entire bourgeois society on its trial, each time more threateningly\u201d.</p> <p>In the 20th century, anxiety and feelings of powerlessness became central to the experience. Charles Madge and Tom Harrisson, founders of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/16/worktown-astonishing-story-mass-observation-david-hall-review\">Mass Observation movement</a> in the crisis-afflicted 1930s, decided that the word had no very exact meaning, but had come to be one of those things, like epidemics and earthquakes, \u201cwhich suddenly arrive to threaten the security of our ordinary lives\u201d. National or international, a crisis was \u201ca kind of melting pot for boundaries, institutions, opinions\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b1245964303f2066b46820e2ab255b4a4aba390\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b1245964303f2066b46820e2ab255b4a4aba390/1_0_2559_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by Matt Kenyon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by Matt Kenyon</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Matt Kenyon/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was the last that most intrigued Madge and Harrisson: how opinions were formed, how they changed, what they were alleged to be, and what they actually were. The <a href=\"https://winstonchurchill.org/the-life-of-churchill/wilderness-years/1935-1939/the-munich-crisis/\">Munich crisis of September 1938</a> and the events leading up to it gave Mass Observation a marvellous chance to find out, and its 1,500 voluntary observers \u2013 interviewers and eavesdroppers in the cause of a primitive anthropology \u2013 were deployed to record both public and private moods.</p> <p>The results <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=S-4jlGRVyKcC&amp;pg=PT9&amp;lpg=PT9&amp;dq=I+am+getting+tired+of+people+talking+about+wars+in+Spain+and+China+%E2%80%A6+if+people+start+talking+about+another+war+I+feel+like+saying+%E2%80%9CFor+goodness+sake+shut+up&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tBtZJ2BYE_&amp;sig=ACfU3U3qBylo-8LAWdQrmCGIL1Uvt7Aihw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj64N3ftc_2AhXkmFwKHSpLAI0Q6AF6BAgCEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=I%20am%20getting%20tired%20of%20people%20talking%20about%20wars%20in%20Spain%20and%20China%20%E2%80%A6%20if%20people%20start%20talking%20about%20another%20war%20I%20feel%20like%20saying%20%E2%80%9CFor%20goodness%20sake%20shut%20up&amp;f=false\">appeared in a Penguin Special</a> published the next year, price sixpence. I bought a secondhand copy 50 years ago, and it remains a favourite book. There\u2019s so much life, variety and wit in it. (Observer to barmaid in Bolton: \u201cWhat do you think of the Austrian crisis?\u201d Barmaid: \u201cOh, I\u2019m not fussy.\u201d) Britain was a different country then \u2013 patriarchal, monocultural, with newspapers, BBC radio and rumour the only sources of information outside the personal experience of family and friends. Nonetheless, attitudes that were common then still persist. The bad news of 1938 produced reactions that have become familiar again in the past few years. One is that there is simply too much of it \u2013 too much news, too much of it bad. Mass Observation found the public\u2019s interest in crises was decreasing. After all, what could people do to change things?</p> <p>A clerk in 1938: \u201cI am getting tired of people talking about wars in Spain and China \u2026 if people start talking about another war I feel like saying, \u2018For goodness sake shut up.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>My neighbour in 2022: \u201cI buy the Week and read it once a week. That\u2019s it. I never read, watch or listen to any other news for the sake of my psychic health.\u201d</p> <p>Wife (to me) in 2022: \u201cShould we switch from the Today programme to Radio 3 in the morning like we did during Covid?\u201d</p> <p>Newspapers were by far the biggest opinion formers in 1938, though the people whose opinions they formed often didn\u2019t trust them. Madge and Harrisson pointed out the irony: \u201cIt is like being led through [a] strange country by a guide who may turn out to be a gangster.

      "bodyText": "Armed conflict, especially when fought against a more powerful enemy, produces the loftiest national rhetoric. It keeps our spirits up, and we tend to remember the best bits. In his speech to the Westminster parliament last week, Volodymyr Zelenskiy echoed Churchill\u2019s \u201cWe shall fight on the beaches\u201d passage from his post-Dunkirk oration, but the Ukrainian president might just as appositely have referenced one of Britain\u2019s most hostile critics. \u201cThese are the times that try men\u2019s souls,\u201d the English radical and American patriot Thomas Paine wrote in 1776, when the American revolutionary war was only a year old and its outcome far from certain. \u201cThe summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country,\u201d Paine continued, \u201cbut he that stands by it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered: yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.\u201d The words began Paine\u2019s essay in a pamphlet \u2013 the first of 16 \u2013 that he hoped would inspire and sustain the colonists\u2019 opposition to London rule. Like a lot of rhetoric, it includes nonsense more apparent today than when it was first heard or read. King George III is now nobody\u2019s idea of a tyrant, and when Paine compares London\u2019s oppressive regulation to slavery \u2013 if it isn\u2019t slavery, he says, then \u201cthere is not such a thing as slavery upon Earth\u201d \u2013 he reveals a remarkable blindness to the real, non-metaphorical chattel slaves who underpinned so much of the American economy. Still, \u201cthe summer soldier and the sunshine patriot\u201d is a memorable phrase, the prose has an appealing rhythm, and, not the least of their attractions, the titles of the pamphlets place them firmly in the modern age. Some were called The American Crisis and others simply The Crisis. A more urgent era had begun. The word itself is ancient \u2013 from the Greek krisis meaning decision, used by Hippocrates to describe the turning point in the progress of a disease that leads either to recovery or death. By the 17th century its usage had begun to spread beyond medicine. In 1627, Sir Benjamin Rudyerd MP, trying to mediate between Charles I and parliament, spoke of the \u201ccrisis of parliaments; by this we shall know whether parliaments will live or die\u201d. Astrologers were soon using the word to describe a conjunction of the planets that was critical to human affairs. Gradually, it came to mean something more prolonged than a life-or-death moment. The factory owner and social reformer Robert Owen edited a short-lived newspaper, The Crisis, that promoted \u201cthe change from error and misery to truth and happiness\u201d, while Marx and Engels in the Communist Manifesto describe \u201ccrises that by their periodical return put the existence of the entire bourgeois society on its trial, each time more threateningly\u201d. In the 20th century, anxiety and feelings of powerlessness became central to the experience. Charles Madge and Tom Harrisson, founders of the Mass Observation movement in the crisis-afflicted 1930s, decided that the word had no very exact meaning, but had come to be one of those things, like epidemics and earthquakes, \u201cwhich suddenly arrive to threaten the security of our ordinary lives\u201d. National or international, a crisis was \u201ca kind of melting pot for boundaries, institutions, opinions\u201d. It was the last that most intrigued Madge and Harrisson: how opinions were formed, how they changed, what they were alleged to be, and what they actually were. The Munich crisis of September 1938 and the events leading up to it gave Mass Observation a marvellous chance to find out, and its 1,500 voluntary observers \u2013 interviewers and eavesdroppers in the cause of a primitive anthropology \u2013 were deployed to record both public and private moods. The results appeared in a Penguin Special published the next year, price sixpence. I bought a secondhand copy 50 years ago, and it remains a favourite book. There\u2019s so much life, variety and wit in it. (Observer to barmaid in Bolton: \u201cWhat do you think of the Austrian crisis?\u201d Barmaid: \u201cOh, I\u2019m not fussy.\u201d) Britain was a different country then \u2013 patriarchal, monocultural, with newspapers, BBC radio and rumour the only sources of information outside the personal experience of family and friends. Nonetheless, attitudes that were common then still persist. The bad news of 1938 produced reactions that have become familiar again in the past few years. One is that there is simply too much of it \u2013 too much news, too much of it bad. Mass Observation found the public\u2019s interest in crises was decreasing. After all, what could people do to change things? A clerk in 1938: \u201cI am getting tired of people talking about wars in Spain and China \u2026 if people start talking about another war I feel like saying, \u2018For goodness sake shut up.\u2019\u201d My neighbour in 2022: \u201cI buy the Week and read it once a week. That\u2019s it. I never read, watch or listen to any other news for the sake of my psychic health.\u201d Wife (to me) in 2022: \u201cShould we switch from the Today programme to Radio 3 in the morning like we did during Covid?\u201d Newspapers were by far the biggest opinion formers in 1938, though the people whose opinions they formed often didn\u2019t trust them. Madge and Harrisson pointed out the irony: \u201cIt is like being led through [a] strange country by a guide who may turn out to be a gangster. Hence most opinion, except the most fanatical, is tinged with uncertainty \u2026 \u201d Today, mainstream sources of news are flatly contested as well as distrusted. Walking to the tube to get to the Russian embassy the other day, and carrying a placard (STOP PUTIN, STOP WAR), my wife had two encounters. A man by an ice-cream van shouted to her: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be careful about your sources of information \u2026 CNN is putting out poison \u2026 You\u2019ve got to keep your radar spinning.\u201d Then, at the station, a woman who turned out to be Russian approached, trembling and hyperventilating. \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s lies, it\u2019s American lies,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Ukrainians have been killing people for years \u2026 in the war they would shoot children.\u201d My wife said that in Russia they couldn\u2019t be having this conversation, and the woman said frankly that was true. \u201cBut the Americans will soon make it like that here, too.\u201d Russia had better things to do than invade Ukraine, morally and practically.

Now 37 and in his 16th season, the young man who made such a mark in his early years with his raw talent has honed it with mental strength and fine judgment. His remarkable success has not merely been a factor of superior machinery, he has been the differentiator.</p> <p>This season might yet be the hardest he has faced; this title would be the crowning moment of a glittering career.</p> <p>Last year he battled fiercely against Max Verstappen in a Red Bull that was, for large parts of the season, the better car. He dragged it to the wire, the final race in Abu Dhabi. Leading at the Yas Marina circuit, he was denied only when a controversial decision by race director Michael Masi gave Verstappen the opportunity to take the win and the title on the final lap. Hamilton described the result as manipulated, his Mercedes team protested but it came to nothing.</p> <p>He has acknowledged that Verstappen was not at fault, having only executed exactly as any driver would have done. He congratulated the Dutchman, remarkably stoic in the face of bitter disappointment, then retreated afterwards, silent on social media amid debate over whether he would retire from the sport. There was, it transpired, no such thing on his mind. He intended to come back. He has a point to make, after all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"395dc204c91555c4a810a280fe2ed94d2884c336\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/395dc204c91555c4a810a280fe2ed94d2884c336/0_445_8640_5184/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Max Verstappen will be in Lewis Hamilton\u2019s sights all season.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Max Verstappen will be in Lewis Hamilton\u2019s sights all season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hassan Ammar/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The mercurial talent of Verstappen, buoyed by his first title, confident, aggressive and spoiling for a fight in a car that looks fearsomely quick again, is the first of Hamilton\u2019s obstacles. Were that not enough, entering the new season Mercedes look to be under pressure. They are by no means in real trouble but in what may be a three-way fight with Red Bull and Ferrari they have problems to solve. Their car has a genuine issue with what is known as porpoising.</p> <p>An unexpected side effect of the new regulations, it causes the car to heavily jar up and down on a straight. It is caused by the floor being pushed too close to the track by the under-car ground-effect downforce. It stalls the airflow under the floor, resulting in a loss of downforce lifting the car back up on its suspension.</p> <p>Mercedes have it badly and their resultant lack of pace is not sandbagging. On Thursday, Hamilton\u2019s new teammate, George Russell, confirmed it, noting that he believed it could not be turned around this week. The car has the potential to be very quick, just not yet, in which time Verstappen could grab a significant lead.</p> <p>Jenson Button, who drove alongside Hamilton at McLaren for three years between 2010 and 2012, believes his mentality will prove key.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/17/formula-one-2022-team-by-team-guide-cars-drivers\">Formula One 2022: a team-by-team guide to the cars and drivers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The pair enjoyed a very competitive rivalry with Button being one of only two teammates (alongside Nico Rosberg) who have managed to beat Hamilton on points over a season. He recalls Hamilton\u2019s greatest strength as one rare among drivers.</p> <p>\u201cIf he had a bad weekend it hit him hard but he always came back stronger than he was before,\u201d Button says. \u201cIt was unusual because a lot of people it would have affected in a negative way but he always came back in the next race and go out and either win or beat me, he was very unusual like that, in that a tough weekend spurred him on at the next one.\u201d</p> <p>This time Hamilton is coming back from more than just a bad weekend, rather, what any driver would consider their worst nightmare. But Button, a world champion himself for Brawn in 2009 and now ambassador for the Williams team, instinctively identifies Hamilton as appearing to be wholly on top of it.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone thinks F1 is a physical game, it\u2019s not, it\u2019s a mental game,\u201d he says. \u201cSo many drivers have amazing ability but if their head\u2019s not in the right place it just doesn\u2019t work, it does not click.\u201d</p> <p>Hamilton has clearly been clicking like a metronome. Nor should he be expected to open the season with anything but absolute commitment as his words in Bahrain make clear. Last year, playing the long game, he was circumspect around the aggressive Verstappen, discretion the better part of valour. Points over point-making. This year there will be no early pass. If the pair go wheel-to-wheel Hamilton can be expected to push back from the off. Youth may have its head but not without consequences. \u201cFrom the word go, Lewis now understands the beast Max Verstappen,\u201d as Button noted.</p> <p>At Mercedes there is without doubt no shortage of determination to come back after what they felt was an injustice rather than a straight defeat.</p> <p>Hamilton will be leading their charge. \u201cIt\u2019s like a new lease of life for Lewis,\u201d adds Button. \u201cHe comes to this season so excited about the fight again because he has finally found someone who can push him to the limit.\u201d</p>",

Hamilton is at his absolute best when coming back from adversity. \u201cI will be a more aggressive driver this year, you\u2019ll see,\u201d he said here. \u201cI want to be the best I can be and to somehow raise my game. I\u2019m not sitting here with any grudge and I don\u2019t have any baggage. It is important to let go and all I do is try to shape what is ahead of me.\u201d The driver competing for a record eighth F1 title is far from the youth who made his debut in 2007. Now 37 and in his 16th season, the young man who made such a mark in his early years with his raw talent has honed it with mental strength and fine judgment. His remarkable success has not merely been a factor of superior machinery, he has been the differentiator. This season might yet be the hardest he has faced; this title would be the crowning moment of a glittering career. Last year he battled fiercely against Max Verstappen in a Red Bull that was, for large parts of the season, the better car. He dragged it to the wire, the final race in Abu Dhabi. Leading at the Yas Marina circuit, he was denied only when a controversial decision by race director Michael Masi gave Verstappen the opportunity to take the win and the title on the final lap. Hamilton described the result as manipulated, his Mercedes team protested but it came to nothing. He has acknowledged that Verstappen was not at fault, having only executed exactly as any driver would have done. He congratulated the Dutchman, remarkably stoic in the face of bitter disappointment, then retreated afterwards, silent on social media amid debate over whether he would retire from the sport. There was, it transpired, no such thing on his mind. He intended to come back. He has a point to make, after all. The mercurial talent of Verstappen, buoyed by his first title, confident, aggressive and spoiling for a fight in a car that looks fearsomely quick again, is the first of Hamilton\u2019s obstacles. Were that not enough, entering the new season Mercedes look to be under pressure. They are by no means in real trouble but in what may be a three-way fight with Red Bull and Ferrari they have problems to solve. Their car has a genuine issue with what is known as porpoising. An unexpected side effect of the new regulations, it causes the car to heavily jar up and down on a straight. It is caused by the floor being pushed too close to the track by the under-car ground-effect downforce. It stalls the airflow under the floor, resulting in a loss of downforce lifting the car back up on its suspension. Mercedes have it badly and their resultant lack of pace is not sandbagging. On Thursday, Hamilton\u2019s new teammate, George Russell, confirmed it, noting that he believed it could not be turned around this week. The car has the potential to be very quick, just not yet, in which time Verstappen could grab a significant lead. Jenson Button, who drove alongside Hamilton at McLaren for three years between 2010 and 2012, believes his mentality will prove key. The pair enjoyed a very competitive rivalry with Button being one of only two teammates (alongside Nico Rosberg) who have managed to beat Hamilton on points over a season. He recalls Hamilton\u2019s greatest strength as one rare among drivers. \u201cIf he had a bad weekend it hit him hard but he always came back stronger than he was before,\u201d Button says. \u201cIt was unusual because a lot of people it would have affected in a negative way but he always came back in the next race and go out and either win or beat me, he was very unusual like that, in that a tough weekend spurred him on at the next one.\u201d This time Hamilton is coming back from more than just a bad weekend, rather, what any driver would consider their worst nightmare. But Button, a world champion himself for Brawn in 2009 and now ambassador for the Williams team, instinctively identifies Hamilton as appearing to be wholly on top of it. \u201cEveryone thinks F1 is a physical game, it\u2019s not, it\u2019s a mental game,\u201d he says. \u201cSo many drivers have amazing ability but if their head\u2019s not in the right place it just doesn\u2019t work, it does not click.\u201d Hamilton has clearly been clicking like a metronome. Nor should he be expected to open the season with anything but absolute commitment as his words in Bahrain make clear. Last year, playing the long game, he was circumspect around the aggressive Verstappen, discretion the better part of valour. Points over point-making. This year there will be no early pass. If the pair go wheel-to-wheel Hamilton can be expected to push back from the off. Youth may have its head but not without consequences. \u201cFrom the word go, Lewis now understands the beast Max Verstappen,\u201d as Button noted. At Mercedes there is without doubt no shortage of determination to come back after what they felt was an injustice rather than a straight defeat. Hamilton will be leading their charge. \u201cIt\u2019s like a new lease of life for Lewis,\u201d adds Button. \u201cHe comes to this season so excited about the fight again because he has finally found someone who can push him to the limit.\u201d",

McCann has just pulled on a blue Ukraine T-shirt, having decided the Russian onslaught means she should save her Fuck the Tories top for another day, which sets Pimblett off on a riff. Custard Creams top his list of unacceptable \u201cTory biscuits\u201d but he makes an exception for deluxe M&amp;S Shortbread, which he finds so delicious they belong in the feast he will demolish after his fight against Rodrigo Vargas on Saturday.</p> <p>Pimblett smiles and ruffles his blond mop-top when I suggest this is not typical fight-talk. \u201cThat\u2019s why I have so many fans,\u201d he says. \u201cI look like the kid next door. Most fighters show off their big muscles, they sneer and snarl, tattoos all over them. I\u2019ve got this haircut and not a single tattoo. But I turn into a different person in the cage. I get tunnel vision and all I think about is this guy in front of me and how I put him to sleep.\u201d</p> <p>The 27-year-old, who describes himself as a socialist and the greatest MMA lightweight in the world, nods when I ask if he really believes he can approach the astronomical fame and wealth McGregor accumulated before hubris diminished him. \u201cYeah. I see myself being bigger than that, because the sport has evolved even more than when Conor made it mainstream. He had twentysomething lads following him where I\u2019m getting kids from the age of five. Kids look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/22/inside-conor-mcgregor-dublin-making-fighting-superstar-floyd-mayweather\" title=\"\">McGregor</a> and see a big, hard fella with loads of tattoos.

I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019m a girl and he\u2019s a boy, but we push each other to be better versions of ourselves and don\u2019t envy each other\u2019s success. If he gets a big sponsorship then it\u2019s: \u2018Go on, lad, well done.\u2019 If I get more airtime he\u2019ll say: \u2018Go on, Moll, it\u2019s right.\u2019 I have not one ounce of doubt in Patrick Pimblett\u2019s ability to be the best in the world.

Pimblett intrigued America\u2019s MMA community with his accent and bold proclamations that he would soon be \u201cthe main man\u201d in UFC. McCann, meanwhile, knew that defeat would spell the end of her UFC career. At 31, she would be cut adrift.</p> <p>They were under enormous pressure. Pimblett needed to match the monumental hype as he moved up from competing in Cage Warriors events after he had turned down offers to switch to UFC twice before. McCann was fighting for survival.</p> <p>\u201cIt was intense,\u201d she says, \u201cbut there were so many warm moments where it was just me and him. I said: \u2018Patrick, I feel a bit nervous. Are you?\u2019 He went: \u2018I am, Moll. But we\u2019ll just get on with it.\u2019 He said to me before I won the [2018 Cage Warriors] world title: \u2018We\u2019re scousers and we\u2019re the best people in the world.

A heavy shot jolted him before Pimblett finished Vendramini with a barrage of blows.</p> <p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he says when I ask if he was hurt. \u201cLook, lad, scousers don\u2019t get knocked out.\u201d McCann says: \u201cAfter Paddy got his KO I ran to the cage, screaming \u2018We shook up the world, lad!\u2019 March 19, at the O<sub>2</sub>, will solidify everything.\u201d</p> <p>Pimblett adds: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a scouse invasion of London and the only thing I can compare to it is when Conor McGregor fought in Dublin. But it\u2019ll be louder than that. Remember the O<sub>2</sub> roof got ripped off by Storm Eunice? What a bad name for a storm. Don\u2019t worry. Storm Baddy is about to hit London.\u201d</p> <p>We drive to Pimblett\u2019s home in Huyton where he grew up. He talks about his growing friendship with Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan and how their fathers were in prison at the same time \u2013 and how Rio Ferdinand found him at Anfield the night before. The former England defender had to be asked by Jake Humphrey to get back to football when, live on BT Sport before Pimblett\u2019s beloved Liverpool played Internazionale, Ferdinand spoke excitedly about meeting the Baddy. Pimblett looked like the Pied Piper as awe-stuck young fans followed him.

When a troll \u201cposted something despicable about Lee\u201d, Pimblett contacted Instagram. After he had been told that no guidelines had been breached he called Instagram \u201cdog-shit\u201d and \u201clizards\u201d.

Their accounts are still open. But mine gets taken. I feel sorry for Vargas [his opponent]. I\u2019m going to take his head off because of Instagram. The post-fight speech is going to be biblical.

So getting signed to the UFC was a dream. I knew that as long as I\u2019m in that cage, you\u2019re going to have to put me to sleep to stop me. And that\u2019s what happened.</p> <p>\u201cMy mum took me to a hotel next to the arena. She\u2019s clean and sober now but she bought me a cider. She was like: \u2018Drink that.\u2019 I sat there, my head swirling, feeling that losing my UFC debut in my home city was the end of the world. My mum said: \u2018You\u2019re cut from my cloth. So go to your after-party and be grateful for what you\u2019ve achieved.\u2019 I said: \u2018Fucking hell, Mum, can\u2019t you give me 10 minutes?\u2019 She went: \u2018No. Go see your people.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI still ended up crying non-stop and got back to my hotel about 10. I went for a Chinese and when I walked in the whole restaurant looked at me and went: \u2018Ahhhhh.\u2019 They\u2019d all seen it. A man came over to me and put \u00a3100 on the table and said: \u2018You\u2019re not buying your dinner tonight, girl. This is on me and my family. Thank you for representing the city so well.\u2019 It meant so much because he understood lots of people will submit and tap out \u2013 but not me or my city.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"078edd14008185975fc3da7b8167356ba3e1eca2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/078edd14008185975fc3da7b8167356ba3e1eca2/0_0_8098_5376/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The two fighters compare bodies during a training session.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The two fighters compare bodies during a training session.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In her next fight, at the O<sub>2</sub> in March 2019, McCann suffered a broken orbital bone and could not see out of her swollen eye for the last round. She still won the fight. \u201cI had four minutes to change the rest of my life and I drew on all the past adversity and found strength. I was thinking this was a good fight to show what scousers are made of because every step I\u2019ve taken in life, every positive thing I\u2019ve accomplished, I attribute to this city. It got me to where I\u2019m going \u2013 to where Patrick and I are going.\u201d</p> <p>McCann\u2019s most difficult battle has been coming out. \u201cAt first I couldn\u2019t even think about my sexuality because we had so much going on in my family. The proudest thing for me was my last name. If anyone can, Molly McCann can. When I went to university I opened up and when I started MMA, with its jujitsu ethos that we are all one, it became easier. Your creed, sexuality, religion don\u2019t matter in this gym.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"24d7a3633a44ab07d64d77ece1c6774e4fa5b329\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24d7a3633a44ab07d64d77ece1c6774e4fa5b329/1128_0_5304_5464/971.jpg\" alt=\"A photo of both fighters appears on the timetable of classes at the next Generation MMA gym in Liverpool.\" width=\"971\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A photo of both fighters appears on the timetable of classes at the next Generation MMA gym in Liverpool.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBut I still struggle to sometimes bring it up. I have had people go: \u2018Oh, that\u2019s fucking gay\u2019 and then they\u2019re like: \u2018I shouldn\u2019t have said that, Molly. I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 When I wrote a little book for kids [about being gay] my friends and family members rang to say: \u2018I am so sorry I made you feel that way.\u2019 That\u2019s absolutely fine, just don\u2019t make anyone else feel that way.\u201d</p> <p>Tears roll down her face but McCann is soon smiling again. She wipes her eyes. \u201cOne of the proudest things I can say is that, like Paddy, I am a scouser. Think about Irishmen and women who had so much adversity through the Troubles. We\u2019re very similar. Jamie Webster released a song called This Place and it made me cry. In fight week, when Paddy and I are warming up, I\u2019ll put that song on and we\u2019ll sing: \u2018My people, my city, my heart \u2026\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Meatball Molly looks up, her eyes shining as she thinks of herself and Paddy the Baddy. \u201cWe owe it all to this place and, on Saturday, we\u2019ll light up the O<sub>2</sub>. Paddy and me will show it\u2019s not all talk or bravado or arrogance. It\u2019s an affirmation of hard work and belief. We\u2019re gonna turn London into a scouse house party.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Paddy the Baddy and Meatball Molly are laughing, again, in a place of dark pain. On Kempston Street, in the heart of Liverpool, the Next Generation MMA gym rocks with joyful noise even though it is here that Paddy Pimblett and Molly McCann practise their bone-breaking kicks and punches. On the mat, and in the cage upstairs, they are flung to the ground by heavier sparring partners who grapple and half-choke them in a restrained imitation of everything that awaits on Saturday night at a sold-out O2 Arena. The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) steams back into London for the first time in three years and the Liverpool fighters threaten to blow the roof off as Pimblett and McCann each take their turn in the cage. Pimblett is being called the next Conor McGregor and he is not shy in promising to \u201ctake over the organisation\u201d and become \u201cthe UFC\u2019s new cash cow\u201d. His great friend McCann, his \u201cbig sister\u201d, has overcome poverty, drug addiction in her family and depression to come out as gay and be the first English woman to win a UFC fight. Her nickname stems from her past work in Subway, where she left every shift smelling of meatballs. She also knows what it is like to win a fight with a shattered eye socket and to be choked unconscious. They understand the danger facing them but they can\u2019t stop kidding around on a Wednesday morning. \u201cI\u2019m a fat little kid at heart,\u201d Pimblett says as he and McCann talk about biscuits and politics. McCann has just pulled on a blue Ukraine T-shirt, having decided the Russian onslaught means she should save her Fuck the Tories top for another day, which sets Pimblett off on a riff. Custard Creams top his list of unacceptable \u201cTory biscuits\u201d but he makes an exception for deluxe M&amp;S Shortbread, which he finds so delicious they belong in the feast he will demolish after his fight against Rodrigo Vargas on Saturday. Pimblett smiles and ruffles his blond mop-top when I suggest this is not typical fight-talk. \u201cThat\u2019s why I have so many fans,\u201d he says. \u201cI look like the kid next door. Most fighters show off their big muscles, they sneer and snarl, tattoos all over them. I\u2019ve got this haircut and not a single tattoo. But I turn into a different person in the cage. I get tunnel vision and all I think about is this guy in front of me and how I put him to sleep.\u201d The 27-year-old, who describes himself as a socialist and the greatest MMA lightweight in the world, nods when I ask if he really believes he can approach the astronomical fame and wealth McGregor accumulated before hubris diminished him. \u201cYeah. I see myself being bigger than that, because the sport has evolved even more than when Conor made it mainstream. He had twentysomething lads following him where I\u2019m getting kids from the age of five. Kids look at McGregor and see a big, hard fella with loads of tattoos. Kids have got long, floppy hair, they haven\u2019t got tattoos. They can identify with me.\u201d McCann chips in. \u201cPaddy might not look like a fighter and, with the mouth he has, you wouldn\u2019t expect him to do all he does for the community. The two of us are totally mad characters but we come from the best and hardest city in the world.\u201d After she shows me her tattoo \u2013 \u201cMy city, my people, my heart\u201d \u2013 in tribute to Liverpool, McCann says: \u201cYou\u2019ll never meet another Patrick Pimblett or Molly McCann. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019m a girl and he\u2019s a boy, but we push each other to be better versions of ourselves and don\u2019t envy each other\u2019s success. If he gets a big sponsorship then it\u2019s: \u2018Go on, lad, well done.\u2019 If I get more airtime he\u2019ll say: \u2018Go on, Moll, it\u2019s right.\u2019 I have not one ounce of doubt in Patrick Pimblett\u2019s ability to be the best in the world. Together, we\u2019ll change the game.\u201d Last September, in Las Vegas, the UFC was given its first taste of the Paddy and Molly Show as Pimblett made his debut and McCann entered the last fight on her contract. Pimblett intrigued America\u2019s MMA community with his accent and bold proclamations that he would soon be \u201cthe main man\u201d in UFC. McCann, meanwhile, knew that defeat would spell the end of her UFC career. At 31, she would be cut adrift. They were under enormous pressure. Pimblett needed to match the monumental hype as he moved up from competing in Cage Warriors events after he had turned down offers to switch to UFC twice before. McCann was fighting for survival. \u201cIt was intense,\u201d she says, \u201cbut there were so many warm moments where it was just me and him. I said: \u2018Patrick, I feel a bit nervous. Are you?\u2019 He went: \u2018I am, Moll. But we\u2019ll just get on with it.\u2019 He said to me before I won the [2018 Cage Warriors] world title: \u2018We\u2019re scousers and we\u2019re the best people in the world. Go show them what we\u2019re made of.\u2019\u201d In Vegas, McCann beat Ji Yeon Kim and earned herself a new four-bout UFC contract and an extra $50,000 for a fight-of-the-night bonus \u2013 with Pimblett getting the same amount for knocking out Luigi Vendramini in the first round. A heavy shot jolted him before Pimblett finished Vendramini with a barrage of blows. \u201cNot really,\u201d he says when I ask if he was hurt. \u201cLook, lad, scousers don\u2019t get knocked out.\u201d McCann says: \u201cAfter Paddy got his KO I ran to the cage, screaming \u2018We shook up the world, lad!\u2019 March 19, at the O2, will solidify everything.\u201d Pimblett adds: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a scouse invasion of London and the only thing I can compare to it is when Conor McGregor fought in Dublin. But it\u2019ll be louder than that. Remember the O2 roof got ripped off by Storm Eunice? What a bad name for a storm. Don\u2019t worry. Storm Baddy is about to hit London.\u201d We drive to Pimblett\u2019s home in Huyton where he grew up. He talks about his growing friendship with Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan and how their fathers were in prison at the same time \u2013 and how Rio Ferdinand found him at Anfield the night before. The former England defender had to be asked by Jake Humphrey to get back to football when, live on BT Sport before Pimblett\u2019s beloved Liverpool played Internazionale, Ferdinand spoke excitedly about meeting the Baddy. Pimblett looked like the Pied Piper as awe-stuck young fans followed him. McCann, who supports Everton, was not there. But Pimblett laments that Kenny Dalglish accepted a knighthood. \u201cI hate the establishment,\u201d he says, \u201cthe royal family and the Tories.\u201d He also talks about the contract \u2013 \u201cworth well over a million pounds\u201d \u2013 he has signed with the American company Barstool Sports and the vlogger from Philadelphia who has moved to Liverpool to follow him and post daily content online. Then, passionately, Pimblett explains his bitter dispute with Instagram, which shut down his account when he had almost a million followers. He uses his social media accounts to raise money to help a little boy called Lee Hodgson receive experimental treatment for terminal cancer. When a troll \u201cposted something despicable about Lee\u201d, Pimblett contacted Instagram. After he had been told that no guidelines had been breached he called Instagram \u201cdog-shit\u201d and \u201clizards\u201d. His account was closed, which cuts off a key route of public access as well as costing him money. Pimblett will send a stinging message to Mark Zuckerberg and Instagram from inside the cage on Saturday. \u201cI\u2019m grabbing the mic and calling Zuckerberg out because the weird thing is he goes on about getting bullied at high school and in college. Why are you letting the bullies win now? Instagram\u2019s an absolute disgrace. The guidelines are ridiculous. \u201cI\u2019ve had people messaging me saying \u2018I\u2019m going to rape your mother\u2019 or sending me pictures of Hillsborough, calling Liverpool fans \u2018fence-munchers\u2019. Their accounts are still open. But mine gets taken. I feel sorry for Vargas [his opponent]. I\u2019m going to take his head off because of Instagram. The post-fight speech is going to be biblical. I\u2019m going to sing Justice for the 97 [of Hillsborough] with the whole arena at a crazy decibel level. Then I\u2019ll just go \u2013 mic drop.\u201d There will be humour, as always, because he has ordered 1,000 lookalike blond wigs for his raucous fans. But there is also anger on behalf of Liverpool. \u201cWhat the government has done to our city for years is disgusting. Knowsley [the borough in which Huyton is located] is the worst-funded in the whole of the UK today. People think I\u2019m talking about 40 years ago. But there are kids in this city eating out of food banks. We\u2019re not a Tory area. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d Pimblett is on his phone for large chunks of the day, answering requests for support, and this desire to help others drives him in the UFC cage. It makes him certain he will surpass McGregor one day. \u201cI\u2019ll be a billionaire eventually,\u201d he says, \u201cand there won\u2019t be no kids eating out of food banks in this city then. I\u2019ll make sure of it.\u201d Pimblett insists he will never leave Liverpool. His fame, however, is approaching the stage where he will need security and he might have to move to a new house so that people can\u2019t turn up at his front door for a selfie. But his ease in being visible at other times will continue \u2013 as will his prolific social media output, which includes a amusing podcast. \u201cThe reason I called it Chattin\u2019 Pony is because, in Liverpool, it means you\u2019re chatting a bit of shit. Tomorrow, I\u2019m doing a new episode with Molly and it\u2019s just us sitting there having an unscripted conversation. We\u2019ll be chattin\u2019 pony and before you know it we\u2019ll have had 200,000 downloads.\u201d We\u2019ve been \u201cchattin\u2019 pony\u201d for so long that Pimblett has to call McCann and tell her we are running late for my interview with her. She is typically understanding and, half an hour later, we\u2019re back in the city centre and across the road from the Subway where she worked so hard while starting out as an MMA fighter. McCann asks me if she should watch the evocative documentary about her that is now available on BT Sport. She is worried about the emotions it might unleash before the fight because, having seen it, I tell her about some of the most moving moments. The documentary opens with her first UFC fight, in Liverpool in May 2018, and captures her devastation after she blacked out during a choking headlock. \u201cThere had never been a female champ like me in Cage Warriors,\u201d she says of the organisation where she made her name. \u201cPatrick sold the most tickets, I\u2019m No 2 and Conor McGregor\u2019s No 3. So getting signed to the UFC was a dream. I knew that as long as I\u2019m in that cage, you\u2019re going to have to put me to sleep to stop me. And that\u2019s what happened. \u201cMy mum took me to a hotel next to the arena. She\u2019s clean and sober now but she bought me a cider. She was like: \u2018Drink that.\u2019 I sat there, my head swirling, feeling that losing my UFC debut in my home city was the end of the world. My mum said: \u2018You\u2019re cut from my cloth. So go to your after-party and be grateful for what you\u2019ve achieved.\u2019 I said: \u2018Fucking hell, Mum, can\u2019t you give me 10 minutes?\u2019 She went: \u2018No. Go see your people.\u2019 \u201cI still ended up crying non-stop and got back to my hotel about 10. I went for a Chinese and when I walked in the whole restaurant looked at me and went: \u2018Ahhhhh.\u2019 They\u2019d all seen it. A man came over to me and put \u00a3100 on the table and said: \u2018You\u2019re not buying your dinner tonight, girl. This is on me and my family. Thank you for representing the city so well.\u2019 It meant so much because he understood lots of people will submit and tap out \u2013 but not me or my city.\u201d In her next fight, at the O2 in March 2019, McCann suffered a broken orbital bone and could not see out of her swollen eye for the last round. She still won the fight. \u201cI had four minutes to change the rest of my life and I drew on all the past adversity and found strength. I was thinking this was a good fight to show what scousers are made of because every step I\u2019ve taken in life, every positive thing I\u2019ve accomplished, I attribute to this city. It got me to where I\u2019m going \u2013 to where Patrick and I are going.\u201d McCann\u2019s most difficult battle has been coming out. \u201cAt first I couldn\u2019t even think about my sexuality because we had so much going on in my family. The proudest thing for me was my last name. If anyone can, Molly McCann can. When I went to university I opened up and when I started MMA, with its jujitsu ethos that we are all one, it became easier. Your creed, sexuality, religion don\u2019t matter in this gym. \u201cBut I still struggle to sometimes bring it up. I have had people go: \u2018Oh, that\u2019s fucking gay\u2019 and then they\u2019re like: \u2018I shouldn\u2019t have said that, Molly.

She wipes her eyes. \u201cOne of the proudest things I can say is that, like Paddy, I am a scouser. Think about Irishmen and women who had so much adversity through the Troubles.

      "body": "<p>When England were pitted against Colombia at the 2018 World Cup, it was time for Steve Cooper to show Gareth Southgate his homework. Cooper, who had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/28/england-under-17-spain-under-17-world-cup\" title=\"\">led England to the under-17 equivalent</a> of the competition the previous year, was tasked by the Football Association with studying the South American side throughout the tournament and flew to Russia to present his findings to Southgate, the staff and the technical director, Dan Ashworth, in the buildup to the last-16 match in Moscow.</p> <p>\u201cDan always used to challenge the coaches: \u2018If you were the England manager, how would you set up? What would you do?\u2019\u201d says the England goalkeeping coach, Martyn Margetson, who later worked with Cooper at Swansea. \u201cThe tactical detail was incredible. He gave us a full insight into what Colombia were, really. You were looking at Steve and thinking: \u2018Yeah, you know your stuff.\u2019 It is a daunting task but Coops did an amazing job.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/03/colombia-england-world-cup-last-16-match-report\">England ended up winning</a> on penalties.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/18/fa-cup-and-premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">FA Cup and Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now Cooper\u2019s focus is on Nottingham Forest and facing Liverpool, where he spent five years coaching in the academy, in Sunday\u2019s FA Cup quarter-final. His work with England\u2019s under-17s, including with Phil Foden, Conor Gallagher and Jadon Sancho, enhanced an already blossoming reputation. Cooper arrived at the FA from Liverpool, where he became academy manager and coached Raheem Sterling and Trent Alexander-Arnold.

      "bodyText": "When England were pitted against Colombia at the 2018 World Cup, it was time for Steve Cooper to show Gareth Southgate his homework. Cooper, who had led England to the under-17 equivalent of the competition the previous year, was tasked by the Football Association with studying the South American side throughout the tournament and flew to Russia to present his findings to Southgate, the staff and the technical director, Dan Ashworth, in the buildup to the last-16 match in Moscow. \u201cDan always used to challenge the coaches: \u2018If you were the England manager, how would you set up? What would you do?\u2019\u201d says the England goalkeeping coach, Martyn Margetson, who later worked with Cooper at Swansea. \u201cThe tactical detail was incredible. He gave us a full insight into what Colombia were, really. You were looking at Steve and thinking: \u2018Yeah, you know your stuff.\u2019 It is a daunting task but Coops did an amazing job.\u201d England ended up winning on penalties. Now Cooper\u2019s focus is on Nottingham Forest and facing Liverpool, where he spent five years coaching in the academy, in Sunday\u2019s FA Cup quarter-final. His work with England\u2019s under-17s, including with Phil Foden, Conor Gallagher and Jadon Sancho, enhanced an already blossoming reputation. Cooper arrived at the FA from Liverpool, where he became academy manager and coached Raheem Sterling and Trent Alexander-Arnold. Since taking charge at Forest in September, Djed Spence, 21, Brennan Johnson, 20, and James Garner, 21, have thrived. \u201cOver a long period, Steve will have worked with some of the best young players in the country,\u201d says Ian Foster, the England Under-19s head coach who, with Mike Marsh, assisted Cooper at the Under-17 World Cup. \u201cIn terms of his recruitment at Swansea, he had worked with [Marc] Gu\u00e9hi, Gallagher, [Rhian] Brewster [with England].

      "body": "<p>The Booth family tombstone in Green Mount Cemetery, Baltimore, is, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/karen-fowler\">Karen Joy Fowler</a> describes it in this epic novel about the distinguished 19th-century American theatrical clan, \u201ca marble obelisk \u2026 almost twenty feet high\u201d. Like that obelisk, the Booth name still casts a long shadow over the US landscape: today we remember the family chiefly because one of its sons, John Wilkes Booth, was the assassin of Abraham Lincoln.</p> <p>Everyone knows the story. It\u2019s 14 April 1865. The civil war is effectively over, and Lincoln is at the theatre, watching a play, when a man enters his box, pulls out a pistol and shoots him in the head. Lincoln dies the following morning. Booth goes on the run but is hunted down and killed 13 days later. The nation is plunged into despair; this presidential death \u2013 the first such assassination in US history \u2013 will leave a lasting scar.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind the scenes look at the making of the magazine\u2019s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind the scenes look at the making of the magazine\u2019s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s past is prologue: the rest of the novel both is, and isn\u2019t, a build-up to that moment. How to deal with the narrative problem of John Wilkes and this inevitable climax is (as Fowler acknowledges in the author\u2019s note) there on nearly every page. She handles it adroitly, interweaving Booth\u2019s story with that of his parents and siblings, a tale that\u2019s colourful and tragic enough in its own right. This isn\u2019t Fowler\u2019s first try at capturing the fraught dynamics of the family, of course: it follows 2013\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/20/completely-beside-ourselves-family-love-review\" title=\"\">We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves</a>, her novel about an extraordinary experiment in adoption. That book, which has a narrative shock in store for the reader partway through, probes familial bonds and the nature of love in an \u201cordinary\u201d American nuclear family.</p> <p>The Booth family story begins with Junius Brutus Booth, the celebrated Shakespearean actor, who flees charges of bigamy in England in 1821 with Mary Ann Holmes, a Drury Lane flower seller (no spoilers here: we\u2019re in the realm of history). Their 10 children are born in near penury on a remote farm in rural Maryland. Lavishly talented, terrifyingly unstable and a committed vegetarian, Junius is the source of much comedy, some of it benignly culinary (\u201cSuddenly Father, who once thought it murder to eat an oyster, has decided they should all be eating fish. None of the children like fish, so this is nothing to celebrate\u201d). And some less so: when his old friend Andrew Jackson becomes president and they disagree, Junius threatens to cut Jackson\u2019s throat. Later we remember that detail.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Stories, like families, are largely about feeling, and this novel gives us feeling on a grand scale</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is a century dominated by men. Four of the Booth children die in infancy; of Junius\u2019s surviving sons, Junius Jr, Edwin and John all follow him on to the stage. His daughters \u2013 sad, dutiful Rosalie, haunted by the apparitions of her lost siblings, and temperamental Asia, who will grow up to become the family chronicler \u2013 know that they don\u2019t count. Rosalie \u201cnever wanted to be the centre of a story, not even her own\u201d. John, on the other hand, who is a Confederate sympathiser, isn\u2019t content to be an observer. He \u201chas always had this need to be <em>in</em> the story\u201d. What\u2019s more, he has \u201cFather\u2019s madness without Father\u2019s genius to excuse it\u201d. His sense of destiny is also fuelled by a dangerous family myth: when he was a baby, his mother saw a special future for him in the flames of the parlour fire. As a grown man he shows off by quoting Macbeth: \u201cStars, hide your fires; Let not light see my black and deep desires.\u201d Did the real John Booth ever say this? He was an actor; he might well have.</p> <p>Booth\u2019s sheer heft and scope \u2013 at nearly 500 pages, it spans a century \u2013 suggest that Fowler\u2019s interest lies as much in the mythopoetic potential of the family epic itself as in a particular set of historical events. History may claim to be about facts, but stories, like families, are largely about feeling, and the novel gives us feeling on a grand scale, even as it asks pertinent and topical questions about who owns those facts. For Booth actually contains two family stories: that of the Booths, and that of the Halls, the slaves who live on their property.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/05/karen-joy-fowler-im-a-bossy-writer-booth-john-wilkes-ursula-le-guin\">Karen Joy Fowler: \u2018I\u2019m a bossy writer; I\u2019m not going to not tell you\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Joe and Ann Hall have been owned by the Booths and their neighbours for most of their lives and have seen their own children routinely sold to other households. That the anguish of this other parallel story is largely invisible to the Booths perhaps treats the material more eloquently than another approach could have. The novel is haunted not just by the ghosts of the Booth dead, but of the Hall children who are lost to the living death of slavery. When the Halls manage to buy back one of their daughters, Ann\u2019s only visible sign of emotion is her refusal to let the child out of her sight. She\u2019s not a trained actor but she performs her part, of pretending that all of this is normal, better than any Booth could: they \u201ccould take acting lessons from her (and probably any other slave in the South as well)\u201d. Ann\u2019s agony and her relief at having her daughter restored to her are all the more powerful because they are unspoken.</p> <p>As these family stories converge with the wider national narrative in America\u2019s traumatic civil war \u2013 in which the question of individual states\u2019 control over the slave system was central \u2013 we realise that they\u2019ve never been distinct at all (\u201cWe cannot escape history,\u201d Lincoln said). It\u2019s a pity, then, that after so much bravura storytelling the last part of the book sometimes reads like a curt historical precis, as if Fowler has finally been overwhelmed by the weight of her material \u2013 or perhaps the simple and entirely creditable desire not to misrepresent it. But this hardly matters. In its stretch and imaginative depth, Booth has an utterly seductive authority. Fowler has pulled off that supremely difficult thing in a historical novel: to convince us that there are things she may have made up, but which are nevertheless true.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 March 2022 as an earlier version described Abraham Lincoln\u2019s assassination, saying the president was \u201cshot in the head by one of the actors, who \u2026 climbed into his box and pulled out a pistol\u201d. While Booth was a well-known actor, he was not part of the cast, and he entered through the box\u2019s door.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Elizabeth Lowry\u2019s novel </em><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-chosen-9781529410686?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">The Chosen</a></em><em> is published </em><em>in</em><em> April</em><em> by </em><em>Ri</em><em>verrun</em><em>.

      "bodyText": "The Booth family tombstone in Green Mount Cemetery, Baltimore, is, as Karen Joy Fowler describes it in this epic novel about the distinguished 19th-century American theatrical clan, \u201ca marble obelisk \u2026 almost twenty feet high\u201d. Like that obelisk, the Booth name still casts a long shadow over the US landscape: today we remember the family chiefly because one of its sons, John Wilkes Booth, was the assassin of Abraham Lincoln. Everyone knows the story. It\u2019s 14 April 1865. The civil war is effectively over, and Lincoln is at the theatre, watching a play, when a man enters his box, pulls out a pistol and shoots him in the head. Lincoln dies the following morning. Booth goes on the run but is hunted down and killed 13 days later. The nation is plunged into despair; this presidential death \u2013 the first such assassination in US history \u2013 will leave a lasting scar. What\u2019s past is prologue: the rest of the novel both is, and isn\u2019t, a build-up to that moment. How to deal with the narrative problem of John Wilkes and this inevitable climax is (as Fowler acknowledges in the author\u2019s note) there on nearly every page. She handles it adroitly, interweaving Booth\u2019s story with that of his parents and siblings, a tale that\u2019s colourful and tragic enough in its own right. This isn\u2019t Fowler\u2019s first try at capturing the fraught dynamics of the family, of course: it follows 2013\u2019s We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves, her novel about an extraordinary experiment in adoption. That book, which has a narrative shock in store for the reader partway through, probes familial bonds and the nature of love in an \u201cordinary\u201d American nuclear family. The Booth family story begins with Junius Brutus Booth, the celebrated Shakespearean actor, who flees charges of bigamy in England in 1821 with Mary Ann Holmes, a Drury Lane flower seller (no spoilers here: we\u2019re in the realm of history). Their 10 children are born in near penury on a remote farm in rural Maryland. Lavishly talented, terrifyingly unstable and a committed vegetarian, Junius is the source of much comedy, some of it benignly culinary (\u201cSuddenly Father, who once thought it murder to eat an oyster, has decided they should all be eating fish. None of the children like fish, so this is nothing to celebrate\u201d). And some less so: when his old friend Andrew Jackson becomes president and they disagree, Junius threatens to cut Jackson\u2019s throat. Later we remember that detail. This is a century dominated by men. Four of the Booth children die in infancy; of Junius\u2019s surviving sons, Junius Jr, Edwin and John all follow him on to the stage. His daughters \u2013 sad, dutiful Rosalie, haunted by the apparitions of her lost siblings, and temperamental Asia, who will grow up to become the family chronicler \u2013 know that they don\u2019t count. Rosalie \u201cnever wanted to be the centre of a story, not even her own\u201d. John, on the other hand, who is a Confederate sympathiser, isn\u2019t content to be an observer. He \u201chas always had this need to be in the story\u201d. What\u2019s more, he has \u201cFather\u2019s madness without Father\u2019s genius to excuse it\u201d. His sense of destiny is also fuelled by a dangerous family myth: when he was a baby, his mother saw a special future for him in the flames of the parlour fire. As a grown man he shows off by quoting Macbeth: \u201cStars, hide your fires; Let not light see my black and deep desires.\u201d Did the real John Booth ever say this? He was an actor; he might well have. Booth\u2019s sheer heft and scope \u2013 at nearly 500 pages, it spans a century \u2013 suggest that Fowler\u2019s interest lies as much in the mythopoetic potential of the family epic itself as in a particular set of historical events. History may claim to be about facts, but stories, like families, are largely about feeling, and the novel gives us feeling on a grand scale, even as it asks pertinent and topical questions about who owns those facts. For Booth actually contains two family stories: that of the Booths, and that of the Halls, the slaves who live on their property. Joe and Ann Hall have been owned by the Booths and their neighbours for most of their lives and have seen their own children routinely sold to other households. That the anguish of this other parallel story is largely invisible to the Booths perhaps treats the material more eloquently than another approach could have. The novel is haunted not just by the ghosts of the Booth dead, but of the Hall children who are lost to the living death of slavery. When the Halls manage to buy back one of their daughters, Ann\u2019s only visible sign of emotion is her refusal to let the child out of her sight. She\u2019s not a trained actor but she performs her part, of pretending that all of this is normal, better than any Booth could: they \u201ccould take acting lessons from her (and probably any other slave in the South as well)\u201d. Ann\u2019s agony and her relief at having her daughter restored to her are all the more powerful because they are unspoken. As these family stories converge with the wider national narrative in America\u2019s traumatic civil war \u2013 in which the question of individual states\u2019 control over the slave system was central \u2013 we realise that they\u2019ve never been distinct at all (\u201cWe cannot escape history,\u201d Lincoln said). It\u2019s a pity, then, that after so much bravura storytelling the last part of the book sometimes reads like a curt historical precis, as if Fowler has finally been overwhelmed by the weight of her material \u2013 or perhaps the simple and entirely creditable desire not to misrepresent it. But this hardly matters. In its stretch and imaginative depth, Booth has an utterly seductive authority. Fowler has pulled off that supremely difficult thing in a historical novel: to convince us that there are things she may have made up, but which are nevertheless true. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 March 2022 as an earlier version described Abraham Lincoln\u2019s assassination, saying the president was \u201cshot in the head by one of the actors, who \u2026 climbed into his box and pulled out a pistol\u201d. While Booth was a well-known actor, he was not part of the cast, and he entered through the box\u2019s door. \u2022 Elizabeth Lowry\u2019s novel The Chosen is published in April by Riverrun. Booth by Karen Joy Fowler is published by Serpent\u2019s Tail (\u00a318.99). To support the Guardian and the Observer, buy a copy at guardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may apply.",

      "body": "<p>Last month, a small group of international scientists met to decide an issue critical to the health of millions of people all over the planet. For once, it wasn\u2019t about coronavirus, although these experts know a lot about that, too. The task in hand was to save us from a bug we\u2019ve been fighting since before the days of Hippocrates, the first doctor to describe it in 400BC. It\u2019s an adversary potentially as much of a threat as Covid. These scientists are the flu hunters \u2013 heads of a handful of international institutions who track this old foe as it evolves and disperses in its own fight for survival.</p> <p>This crucial annual meeting was held, for the first time since Covid struck, in the plateglass anonymity of the World Health Organization building in Geneva, with a few participants on Zoom. The scientists came armed with mountains of data and decades of experience to decide which four strains of the flu virus circling the globe should be in the next flu vaccine, to protect us from illness and our healthcare systems from buckling. Each has their own opinion and there can be wrangling and even some political positioning. Experts from China, the US, Australia, Japan and Russia are involved. It\u2019s not always easy. But on 25 February, with what surely ought to have been a white puff of pontifical smoke, they made their recommendation public. Many thousands of lives will be saved \u2013 if they have got it right.</p> <p>Chairing the meeting was British virologist Dr John McCauley, who has attended these meetings for more than a decade \u2013 usually in person. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not on Zoom, but it\u2019s awful on Zoom,\u201d he says with a grimace. McCauley, who is in his 60s, grey-haired and jocular, has spent a lifetime watching the devious twists and turns of the shapeshifting virus. Since 2009, he has been director of the Worldwide Influenza Centre in London, based at the Francis Crick Institute next to St Pancras station. And in the months leading up to the meeting, he was busy taking delivery of large numbers of boxes of carefully packaged, potentially lethal human flu virus samples from 90 centres, mostly in Europe. In a normal year \u2013 and the last two have been far from normal \u2013 the Crick receives 120 or 130 shipments, containing about 5,000 samples. Other boxes stacked ready to be shipped out contain viruses destined for labs in other countries, where scientists will compare them with their own samples. The labels are a story of friendship, colonialism and cooperation: Cyprus, Valladolid, a pre-war St Petersburg.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Flu hunters know better than to underestimate their enemy. If you can\u2019t see it just now, it\u2019s probably only hiding</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere are periods in which we\u2019re very busy and periods in which we\u2019re extremely busy,\u201d McCauley says. He patiently explains the complexities of the virus, with just an occasional flash of suppressed irritation at this interruption to his lifesaving work. He strides briskly in his white coat between his small glass office overlooking the institute\u2019s atrium and the dark, closed-off labs behind it. Entry to the labs is restricted whenever there is live flu virus around. </p> <p>In January, the trickle of flu virus samples becomes a flood. Cardboard boxes containing the evidence of its latest mutations are brought in and transferred to freezers at -80C, where they will last for a couple of weeks while lab staff get to work. For what they have to do, the word \u201ctesting\u201d is inadequate, McCauley\u2019s frown makes clear. It\u2019s about \u201cisolating the virus, propagating the virus, doing the genetic analysis, doing the antigenic analysis, doing the drug resistance analysis, on all of these,\u201d he says. McCauley must work out how the virus is changing so that he can inform the February meeting.</p> <p>***</p> <p>This year something unusual has been happening. There has hardly been any flu for the past two winters. There\u2019s even speculation that some strains have vanished completely. But the flu hunters know better than to underestimate their enemy. If you can\u2019t see it just now, it\u2019s probably only hiding. Flu is a killer. It\u2019s not just a bad cold. Man flu is \u2013 well, not flu. If you\u2019re at work and think you\u2019ve got flu, you probably haven\u2019t. A proper bout will keep you in bed for days, unable to do much more than moan. Without vaccines, it would regularly scythe through the population, and occasionally cause pandemics, as it did in 1918, when it killed at least 20 million people (Covid has so far killed an estimated 6 million). And it\u2019s a complicated, slippery foe, one that is very good at evolving or mutating to escape vaccines.</p> <p>There are even two types: B, a historically human variety, and A, the animal sort, which can jump species and cause pandemics. Flu B, McCauley says, \u201chas been with us for 10,000 years\u201d. That\u2019s the one Hippocrates knew about. Flu A, on the other hand, originates in animals and birds. Sometimes people in daily contact with domesticated animals, such as pigs and chickens, pick up the virus. Just before Christmas 2021, 79-year-old Alan Gosling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/07/first-uk-person-to-catch-h5n1-bird-flu-strain-is-named\" title=\"\">caught bird flu</a> from his Muscovy ducks. About 100 wandered his land in Buckfastleigh, Devon; he fed them and 20 lived in the house. He was the first person in Britain to test positive for an A strain called H5N1. The tragedy for Gosling was that all the birds had to be killed and he was banned from adopting more. The good news for everyone else is that the strain was incapable of spreading from him to any other human.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fcab68f98c08cad042fed5b88931d62a7bd4841a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcab68f98c08cad042fed5b88931d62a7bd4841a/0_395_8143_4888/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr John \u00adMcCauley, director of the Worldwide \u00adInfluenza Centre in London, in a lab\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019re trying to get some virus in from Hong Kong but there are no flights\u2019: Dr John McCauley, director of the Worldwide \u00adInfluenza Centre in London</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There has been a lot of bird flu about, in the UK and across Europe, known as \u201chighly pathogenic avian influenza\u201d or HPAI. In England, it started in October in <a href=\"https://www.worcesternews.co.uk/news/19699557.swan-sanctuary-fenced-off-bird-flu-outbreak-confirmed-worcester/\" title=\"\">wild swans in Worcester</a>. Wild birds carry the virus; domestic birds pick it up. When it gets into poultry, whole flocks have to be slaughtered. There is always the risk that farm workers in contact with chickens, geese or ducks will contract the virus, as Gosling did.</p> <p>Usually, this bird strain of flu cannot be transmitted from the farm worker to any other human. The nightmare scenario is where the virus evolves again and is able to be passed on. Then you\u2019re in potential pandemic territory. In 1918, the \u201cSpanish flu\u201d came from birds. This was a lethal strain of Flu A called H1N1 that killed scores of soldiers and young people at the end of the first world war \u2013 previous infections meant older generations had more immunity to it. The strain stuck around until 1957 or so, but by then it was no longer causing devastation because so many people had been exposed to it.</p> <p>Another strain of H1N1 caused the swine flu pandemic in 2009, which took off in Mexico and the southern US. It caused a massive scare, but far fewer deaths than feared: approximately 400 in the UK and up to half a million worldwide. Bad, but not on the scale of 1918.</p> <p>Pandemic flu is so deadly because it is caused by a bird or animal virus that is totally unknown to the human immune system. As with Sars-CoV2, the cause of Covid-19, viruses kill when we are not prepared for them. Seasonal flus surge in the winter months, when people are huddled together indoors and breathing each other\u2019s air. In a normal year, up to <a href=\"https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=208914\" title=\"\">646,000 people worldwide die of flu</a>.</p> <p>A vaccine against one flu strain won\u2019t always defend against another, which means the shot has to contain a cocktail. The two strains of Flu A in the current vaccine are H1N1 and H3N2. The latter arrived in the 1968 pandemic that began in birds in Hong Kong and killed millions. Each of these strains has evolved different versions, which have complicated code numbers and may also be named after the place they were first spotted, such as Victoria, Yamagata, Texas or Bangladesh. Flu isn\u2019t fussy; it will happily mutate anywhere.</p> <p>So how do you outwit and outflank a virus this adaptable and devilish? How can you stop it in its tracks?</p> <p>***</p> <p>Global flu surveillance started in the UK. Back in 1947, the year before the WHO was launched, British virologist Christopher Andrewes, arguably the first flu detective, was involved in talks about the nascent UN organisation\u2019s work. The Spanish flu was a horror story in living memory and tracking influenza a priority. Andrewes was asked to set up a Worldwide Influenza Centre, which he did in 1948 under the auspices of the National Institute for Medical Research in London. In 2016, the NIMR <a href=\"https://www.crick.ac.uk/partnerships/worldwide-influenza-centre\" title=\"\">became part</a> of the Francis Crick Institute.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/298/6667/180\" title=\"\">Obituaries</a> of Andrewes, who died in 1988, paint him as the archetypal eccentric but brilliant British boffin. \u201cChristopher Andrewes was characteristically seen in a tweed jacket, white hair rather dishevelled, his ruddy face expressing interest, puzzlement, concentration, or fun \u2013 never boredom,\u201d wrote fellow virologist, David Tyrrell, who in 1965 discovered <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/369/bmj.m1547.full.pdf\" title=\"\">the first human coronavirus</a> (a cause of the common cold). </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Coronaviruses have demonstrated their potential for causing havoc over years. With Sars and Mers, globally we dodged a bullet</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 1933, Andrewes helped <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-h-word/2013/jul/08/influenza-virus-discovery-mrc-nimr\" title=\"\">discover the influenza A virus</a>. Three years later, 16-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/apr/22/dennis-busby-obituary\" title=\"\">Dennis Busby</a>, who had joined the NIMR straight from school as a \u201clab boy\u201d, received the first ever flu vaccination. He was not paraded for the cameras like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/08/coventry-woman-90-first-patient-to-receive-covid-vaccine-in-nhs-campaign\" title=\"\">Margaret Keenan</a>, the first in the world to receive an approved Covid vaccine. In those days, scientific breakthroughs happened more discreetly, and a vital global breakthrough went unmarked.</p> <p>The stories have become folklore among the virologists who have followed Andrewes down the years \u2013 a small group you can\u2019t help thinking were cultivated in the same petri dish. \u201cI knew Dennis Busby,\u201d McCauley says. \u201cHe was one of the best virological, technical guys.\u201d Busby went on to become head technician in the bacteriology and virus division of the NIMR, which moved to Mill Hill, London, in 1950. Was it ethical to jab him with an experimental vaccine at an age when most boys are at school? \u201cHe prepared it himself,\u201d McCauley says, almost proudly. </p> <p>McCauley\u2019s predecessor-but-one as head of the Worldwide Influenza Centre was Sir John Skehel, an eminent virologist who has shown, among other things, how the influenza virus enters human cells and how antibodies can block it. Skehel ran the centre from 1975 to 1993 and was director of the NIMR until 2006.</p> <p>\u201cWould you like to meet him?\u201d McCauley asks. And there he is, the 81-year-old recipient of a string of awards and honorary degrees, across the atrium from McCauley at the Crick, working in a similar small office, cheerful and welcoming. The two chat about the difficulties in tracking flu caused by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine\u2019s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine\u2019s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get some virus in from Hong Kong, but there are no flights,\u201d McCauley says.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s too bad,\u201d Skehel says. \u201cHong Kong is an important laboratory. They picked up H5N1 bird flu in 1997.\u201d</p> <p>In the past, Hong Kong has been a window on to what flu is doing in mainland China. It has excellent scientists, often trained in the UK and well known to their British counterparts, and some of the samples they collect are from southern China. As China takes an ever firmer grip of Hong Kong, it\u2019s uncertain whether the UK will continue to get those sorts of insights.</p> <p>Seven WHO global reference centres \u2013 the Crick, Atlanta and Memphis in the US, Beijing, Tokyo, Melbourne and Novosibirsk \u2013 lead flu surveillance around the world. Five are devoted to human flu; two watch for animal viruses that might jump to humans. They are on the alert for flu outbreaks in chickens in Egypt and pigs in Central America, seeing whether farm workers or families with animals get infected and start to infect others. </p> <p>Feeding into those WHO hubs are national influenza centres. In England, this is run by revered virologist Prof Maria Zambon at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). Zambon was one of the key members of the government\u2019s Sage advisory committee during the Covid pandemic, alongside her Imperial College colleague Prof Neil Ferguson. She is also an adviser to the WHO. And she never stops working.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e33839d6c1bbd7549a7bb4dee4bc26968d9b124b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e33839d6c1bbd7549a7bb4dee4bc26968d9b124b/0_537_8056_4836/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prof Maria Zambon, head of the UK\u2019s national influenza centre, in a lab\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018You need a crystal ball, and mismatches happen\u2019: Prof Maria Zambon, head of the UK\u2019s national influenza centre</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Decades ago, Zambon was part of the core influenza group at Mill Hill. There is a \u201cstrong historical thread\u201d running from Andrewes to the present day, she says. And she\u2019s not surprised so many of the people she knew a quarter of a century ago, such as Skehel, are still tackling flu. \u201cYou fall in love with working on viruses,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a very good start for me because I was surrounded by top-class scientists in a wonderful, collaborative environment. And you take that passion with you.\u201d</p> <p>Even when the world is engulfed in a pandemic caused by a different virus, flu really matters. \u201cWhichever way you look at it, it\u2019s a major public health threat. And we still haven\u2019t quite solved the problem,\u201d Zambon says.</p> <p>She is heavily involved in the response to Covid at UKHSA and Imperial College, where she is co-director of the NIHR health protection research unit. Was she surprised the pandemic that shut down the world was caused not by flu, as scientists had for so long predicted, but coronavirus? \u201cThe answer to that is yes,\u201d she says, \u201cand no. Coronaviruses have demonstrated their potential for causing havoc over a number of years.\u201d</p> <p>Zambon helped identify the first Sars virus in 2003, as one of an international team of virologists analysing samples from 436 patients in six countries. In 2012, she led the UK\u2019s efforts to understand another coronavirus, Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome), that turned up in two people who had travelled to the UK and spread to two others. She advised the WHO on it. \u201cWith both of those episodes, globally we dodged a bullet,\u201d she says.</p> <p>It\u2019s thanks to all that historical UK influenza effort that the world is in a better place to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. Not only is surveillance strong, but so is the UK\u2019s ability to assess how well vaccines are working through the matching of data on immunisation and illness. \u201cWe have a vaccine effectiveness system for Covid vaccines that is virtually second to none,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Zambon\u2019s team at the national influenza centre sends the Crick \u201cone or two examples of things that are absolutely representative. And then if we see anything unusual, or a bit weird, we\u2019ll give it to them as well. So they are getting a kind of digest of viruses from us.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d03b2e6a951ac834dfa753c63ffa5f25f4a8c8d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d03b2e6a951ac834dfa753c63ffa5f25f4a8c8d0/0_0_8138_5428/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Catherine Moore, head of Welsh flu surveillance, in a lab\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019ve had two years of basically nothing\u2019: Dr Catherine Moore, head of Welsh flu surveillance</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Each of the devolved UK administrations does its own collection and analysis of flu samples, and sends McCauley those they consider interesting. There can be variations in what you find even within regions, says Dr Catherine Moore, who heads flu surveillance at Public Health Wales. Her field is molecular diagnostics, investigating changes in human, viral and microbial genomes to diagnose diseases. She swung into action at the start of the Covid pandemic, developing a molecular assay diagnostics test (PCR) to detect its genetic material (RNA) within a month of the coronavirus being recognised. </p> <p>Moore knows Zambon and McCauley well, and shares their enthusiasm. She is \u201cthe current custodian\u201d of a system that has been running for 40 years, she says. It\u2019s \u201can absolute joy\u201d to be even a small cog in the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS).</p> <p> What matters is not the number of flu samples they collect, she says, but gathering high-quality data that can indicate the drift of virus strains, potentially into something different and troublesome. They operate within the hospital system in Wales: \u201cWhat we want to look at is the severe end of the spectrum.\u201d That\u2019s all the way from a one-night stay to intensive care.</p> <p>Moore has 44 GP practices also feeding in test results. In England, there are 245, organised through a network run by the Royal College of General Practitioners. Since 1967, GPs have <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870877/\" title=\"\">collated reports of flu diagnoses</a> from selected practices around the country. In 1994, Zambon was involved in helping with the transition to a system where patients\u2019 flu samples are dispatched to centralised public health laboratories for virological testing. GPs used to be at the sharp end of all of this, swabbing their patients\u2019 throats for flu virus in the way we all now know how to do. Flu is easy to catch, so it was a high-risk occupation. Covid has changed things dramatically, and now people in low-risk groups with flu-like symptoms are able to request home test kits and submit their own samples.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"591a5b05fbe420726134b5f6623302e6a63039a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/591a5b05fbe420726134b5f6623302e6a63039a7/0_2126_5464_5598/976.jpg\" alt=\"Prof Simon de Lusignan, who runs England\u2019s GP sample collections network\" width=\"976\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Much less explanation is needed now on how to take a swab\u2019: Prof Simon de Lusignan, who runs England\u2019s GP sample collections network</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOne of the things the pandemic has done is ensure that much less explanation is needed now on how to take a swab,\u201d says Prof Simon de Lusignan, an academic GP at the University of Oxford who runs the network organising sample collection in England. A charity called TakeATestUK dispatches the flu kit. The patient does the throat swab and posts it off to Zambon\u2019s lab teams for analysis. GPs still feel they need to see some patients in person \u2013 such as older people who may have a chest infection, and small babies \u2013 but others will be told they are best staying warm, drinking fluids and getting over it at home.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The vaccine strain selection meetings at the WHO started in the early 1970s and take place <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine-selection.htm\" title=\"\">twice a year</a>. In February, they recommend the virus cocktail to go into the northern hemisphere vaccine, with a meeting six months later for the southern hemisphere.</p> <p>The meeting used to recommend three strains. Now, manufacturing technology has improved to accommodate four. It is difficult stuff. Not every virus strain can be grown successfully \u2013 traditionally in chicken eggs \u2013 in the quantity needed (it is then deactivated). Usually, the committee gets it right, pretty much. \u201cWe normally say it\u2019s right something like 70 to 80% of the time, because what you\u2019re trying to do is to match a vaccine strain selection with a moving target,\u201d Zambon says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>In early 2018, people with the B Yamagata virus filled half the UK\u2019s intensive care beds. Now it might have shot its bolt</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But it\u2019s an educated bet. You can see the runners and riders \u2013 the strains that are most prevalent in the world \u2013 but they can change within six months. \u201cThat\u2019s what you need the crystal ball for,\u201d she says. \u201cSome of the time, there\u2019ll be a runner that pops up by August or September that was not present in January or February and if that runner emerges, and is successful against the other riders, then you have a mismatch. It does happen, and it can be painful when it does.\u201d</p> <p>A mismatch is the nightmare. The experts got it wrong in 2014-15. The vaccine protected against Flu B and the H1N1 strain of Flu A, but not against H3N2. In February 2014, the Geneva meeting had opted for the Texas strain of H3N2, kickstarting manufacture of the vaccine across Europe and the US. But as early as March, the flu watchers could see that a different strain of H3N2, from Switzerland, was spreading faster. \u201cIt dominated in the winter of 2014-15,\u201d McCauley says. It was too late to switch horses. If vaccine production had been stopped to make a change in the component strains, there would not have been enough of it. That year, there were an estimated <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/excesswintermortalityinenglandandwales/201415provisionaland201314final\" title=\"\">43,900 excess winter deaths</a> in England and Wales \u2013 the largest number since 1999-2000.</p> <p>Something odd is happening with Flu B, too. For some time, the two B strains in the vaccine have been Victoria and Yamagata. Now Yamagata seems to have disappeared. \u201cAt the start of 2018, half the intensive care unit beds in the UK were filled with people with B Yamagata lineage viruses,\u201d McCauley says. \u201cNow it might have shot its bolt. We haven\u2019t seen a B Yamagata lineage virus for over a year in these laboratories.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa8fcfbd85a44bc6e6c093f06ecf5beab7dcff90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa8fcfbd85a44bc6e6c093f06ecf5beab7dcff90/0_546_8192_4918/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plastic gloved hands over eggs in which flu virus strains are being grown in a lab\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Virus strains being grown in eggs</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s going on? The experts don\u2019t know, exactly. The flu hunters trail influenza but can never get ahead of it. And right now, predicting what it will do next is difficult. Strange things are happening. Not only has Yamagata vanished, but China has reported only Flu B and no Flu A, the animal variety \u2013 so the speculation is that it\u2019s not circulating. And in the US, neither Yamagata nor one of the substrains of H3N2 (which doesn\u2019t have a place name) has been spotted since March 2020.</p> <p>The answer must have to do with the Covid pandemic. McCauley produces a slide that dramatically demonstrates what happened in the winter of 2020-21, the first of the pandemic. Flu went into lockdown; there wasn\u2019t any to speak of. Social distancing and mask-wearing thwarted not just coronavirus but flu, too. At the Crick, they were able to clear a backlog of work. They hadn\u2019t been able to do that since 2008. \u201cLast year, we did have periods when we didn\u2019t have stuff to do,\u201d McCauley says with a grin.</p> <p>But if there are fewer reports of flu, is that really because of all the social distancing and mask-wearing? Or is it that people are not going to the GP or hospital and instead are staying at home in bed with a raging fever unnoticed?</p> <p>Moore in Wales says it\u2019s been hard to read. \u201cBecause of the pandemic, a lot of our surveillance systems have been disrupted, and particularly in the community.\u201d But, on the whole, it seems there genuinely is less flu. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite remarkable. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen anything like this in my entire career,\u201d she says.</p> <p>In 2019, before the pandemic hit, things were looking dodgy. \u201cWe were in a really brisk season,\u201d she says. There were four H3N2 substrains circulating in Wales, at least two of which were not great matches for the strain in the vaccine. Moore was expecting a tricky winter. \u201cThen suddenly Sars [Covid-19] arrived,\u201d she says. Because of mitigations such as social distancing, masks and working from home, \u201cflu stopped circulating. We\u2019ve had two years of basically nothing. No signal at all for influenza.\u201d It\u2019s no different in the rest of Europe.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve got a massive epidemic in UK birds. We have a human infection from it and birds are dying. Nobody seems to care</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Flu can vanish \u2013 and flu can come roaring back. McCauley and the committee have chosen their strains for next winter. It includes a B Yamagata-type strain (Phuket) in spite of its apparent disappearance, along with H1N1 (Victoria), H3N2 (Darwin) and B (Austria). \u201cIt is far too early to conclude it [Yamagata] is extinct,\u201d he says. And not much flu means there is less natural immunity against it. People don\u2019t have the antibodies from getting ill; at least, not the antibodies from recent strains.</p> <p>All of us have some baseline immunity to flu. People born before about 1957 have some resilience to H1N1. It lurked for 40 or so years after the 1918 pandemic, altered in substrains, but older people have some general protection against it all the same. That\u2019s why, in 2009 \u2013 the swine flu pandemic, which was also H1N1 \u2013 it was working people, aged 25 to 35, who died. Have I heard of \u201coriginal antigenic sin\u201d, Moore asks. The first flu strain you came into contact with is what your immune system remembers best, she explains. \u201cThat\u2019s your immune system\u2019s memory. If you encountered H1N1 as a child, you will be better protected against strains of that than against those of H3N2. And those born in the few years before the 1968-69 Hong Kong flu pandemic are likely to have more immunity to H3N2, which caused it. So H3N2 hits elderly people harder.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7181c1002e289f7cc1051cf24737d199001c956\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7181c1002e289f7cc1051cf24737d199001c956/182_960_7499_4500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"UKHSA epidemiologist Conall Watson, carrying a vaccines book in a corridor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Really \u00adpositive developments are preventing hospitalisations\u2019: UKHSA epidemiologist Conall Watson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Flu travels the world. It may start in Hong Kong or in Bangladesh, but there are no border controls. Global cooperation is essential, and that includes sharing samples of virus \u2013 carefully. McCauley won\u2019t send flu virus to countries whose labs are anything less than highly secure. He mentions a country that asked for samples from the UK for comparison purposes. He wasn\u2019t impressed with their safety protocols. \u201cI said, \u2018Would you accept Ebola? Would you do this with Ebola?\u2019 And they went, \u2018No, no, we wouldn\u2019t do that.\u2019 I said, \u2018OK, so Ebola kills 70% of people. And this virus kills 40% of people that it infects. What\u2019s the difference?\u2019\u201d </p> <p>***</p> <p>The flu hunters have decades of experience but there are always anxious moments. Moore is concerned about Alan Gosling and his Muscovy ducks. The ducks were infected because, while human flu is at low levels, bird flu in the UK is not. \u201cWe\u2019re right in the middle of a massive epidemic in our birds in the UK,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She cannot understand the lack of interest. \u201cWe have a human infection from it and birds are dying. Nobody seems to care, but it\u2019s part of the same family of viruses. I find it remarkable that flu has been denigrated almost to just a cold. It\u2019s not.

      "bodyText": "Last month, a small group of international scientists met to decide an issue critical to the health of millions of people all over the planet. For once, it wasn\u2019t about coronavirus, although these experts know a lot about that, too. The task in hand was to save us from a bug we\u2019ve been fighting since before the days of Hippocrates, the first doctor to describe it in 400BC. It\u2019s an adversary potentially as much of a threat as Covid. These scientists are the flu hunters \u2013 heads of a handful of international institutions who track this old foe as it evolves and disperses in its own fight for survival. This crucial annual meeting was held, for the first time since Covid struck, in the plateglass anonymity of the World Health Organization building in Geneva, with a few participants on Zoom. The scientists came armed with mountains of data and decades of experience to decide which four strains of the flu virus circling the globe should be in the next flu vaccine, to protect us from illness and our healthcare systems from buckling. Each has their own opinion and there can be wrangling and even some political positioning. Experts from China, the US, Australia, Japan and Russia are involved. It\u2019s not always easy. But on 25 February, with what surely ought to have been a white puff of pontifical smoke, they made their recommendation public. Many thousands of lives will be saved \u2013 if they have got it right. Chairing the meeting was British virologist Dr John McCauley, who has attended these meetings for more than a decade \u2013 usually in person. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not on Zoom, but it\u2019s awful on Zoom,\u201d he says with a grimace. McCauley, who is in his 60s, grey-haired and jocular, has spent a lifetime watching the devious twists and turns of the shapeshifting virus. Since 2009, he has been director of the Worldwide Influenza Centre in London, based at the Francis Crick Institute next to St Pancras station. And in the months leading up to the meeting, he was busy taking delivery of large numbers of boxes of carefully packaged, potentially lethal human flu virus samples from 90 centres, mostly in Europe. In a normal year \u2013 and the last two have been far from normal \u2013 the Crick receives 120 or 130 shipments, containing about 5,000 samples. Other boxes stacked ready to be shipped out contain viruses destined for labs in other countries, where scientists will compare them with their own samples. The labels are a story of friendship, colonialism and cooperation: Cyprus, Valladolid, a pre-war St Petersburg. \u201cThere are periods in which we\u2019re very busy and periods in which we\u2019re extremely busy,\u201d McCauley says. He patiently explains the complexities of the virus, with just an occasional flash of suppressed irritation at this interruption to his lifesaving work. He strides briskly in his white coat between his small glass office overlooking the institute\u2019s atrium and the dark, closed-off labs behind it. Entry to the labs is restricted whenever there is live flu virus around. In January, the trickle of flu virus samples becomes a flood. Cardboard boxes containing the evidence of its latest mutations are brought in and transferred to freezers at -80C, where they will last for a couple of weeks while lab staff get to work. For what they have to do, the word \u201ctesting\u201d is inadequate, McCauley\u2019s frown makes clear. It\u2019s about \u201cisolating the virus, propagating the virus, doing the genetic analysis, doing the antigenic analysis, doing the drug resistance analysis, on all of these,\u201d he says. McCauley must work out how the virus is changing so that he can inform the February meeting. *** This year something unusual has been happening. There has hardly been any flu for the past two winters. There\u2019s even speculation that some strains have vanished completely. But the flu hunters know better than to underestimate their enemy. If you can\u2019t see it just now, it\u2019s probably only hiding. Flu is a killer. It\u2019s not just a bad cold. Man flu is \u2013 well, not flu. If you\u2019re at work and think you\u2019ve got flu, you probably haven\u2019t. A proper bout will keep you in bed for days, unable to do much more than moan. Without vaccines, it would regularly scythe through the population, and occasionally cause pandemics, as it did in 1918, when it killed at least 20 million people (Covid has so far killed an estimated 6 million). And it\u2019s a complicated, slippery foe, one that is very good at evolving or mutating to escape vaccines. There are even two types: B, a historically human variety, and A, the animal sort, which can jump species and cause pandemics. Flu B, McCauley says, \u201chas been with us for 10,000 years\u201d. That\u2019s the one Hippocrates knew about. Flu A, on the other hand, originates in animals and birds. Sometimes people in daily contact with domesticated animals, such as pigs and chickens, pick up the virus. Just before Christmas 2021, 79-year-old Alan Gosling caught bird flu from his Muscovy ducks. About 100 wandered his land in Buckfastleigh, Devon; he fed them and 20 lived in the house. He was the first person in Britain to test positive for an A strain called H5N1. The tragedy for Gosling was that all the birds had to be killed and he was banned from adopting more. The good news for everyone else is that the strain was incapable of spreading from him to any other human. There has been a lot of bird flu about, in the UK and across Europe, known as \u201chighly pathogenic avian influenza\u201d or HPAI. In England, it started in October in wild swans in Worcester. Wild birds carry the virus; domestic birds pick it up. When it gets into poultry, whole flocks have to be slaughtered. There is always the risk that farm workers in contact with chickens, geese or ducks will contract the virus, as Gosling did. Usually, this bird strain of flu cannot be transmitted from the farm worker to any other human. The nightmare scenario is where the virus evolves again and is able to be passed on. Then you\u2019re in potential pandemic territory. In 1918, the \u201cSpanish flu\u201d came from birds. This was a lethal strain of Flu A called H1N1 that killed scores of soldiers and young people at the end of the first world war \u2013 previous infections meant older generations had more immunity to it. The strain stuck around until 1957 or so, but by then it was no longer causing devastation because so many people had been exposed to it. Another strain of H1N1 caused the swine flu pandemic in 2009, which took off in Mexico and the southern US. It caused a massive scare, but far fewer deaths than feared: approximately 400 in the UK and up to half a million worldwide. Bad, but not on the scale of 1918. Pandemic flu is so deadly because it is caused by a bird or animal virus that is totally unknown to the human immune system. As with Sars-CoV2, the cause of Covid-19, viruses kill when we are not prepared for them. Seasonal flus surge in the winter months, when people are huddled together indoors and breathing each other\u2019s air. In a normal year, up to 646,000 people worldwide die of flu. A vaccine against one flu strain won\u2019t always defend against another, which means the shot has to contain a cocktail. The two strains of Flu A in the current vaccine are H1N1 and H3N2. The latter arrived in the 1968 pandemic that began in birds in Hong Kong and killed millions. Each of these strains has evolved different versions, which have complicated code numbers and may also be named after the place they were first spotted, such as Victoria, Yamagata, Texas or Bangladesh. Flu isn\u2019t fussy; it will happily mutate anywhere. So how do you outwit and outflank a virus this adaptable and devilish? How can you stop it in its tracks? *** Global flu surveillance started in the UK. Back in 1947, the year before the WHO was launched, British virologist Christopher Andrewes, arguably the first flu detective, was involved in talks about the nascent UN organisation\u2019s work. The Spanish flu was a horror story in living memory and tracking influenza a priority. Andrewes was asked to set up a Worldwide Influenza Centre, which he did in 1948 under the auspices of the National Institute for Medical Research in London. In 2016, the NIMR became part of the Francis Crick Institute. Obituaries of Andrewes, who died in 1988, paint him as the archetypal eccentric but brilliant British boffin. \u201cChristopher Andrewes was characteristically seen in a tweed jacket, white hair rather dishevelled, his ruddy face expressing interest, puzzlement, concentration, or fun \u2013 never boredom,\u201d wrote fellow virologist, David Tyrrell, who in 1965 discovered the first human coronavirus (a cause of the common cold). In 1933, Andrewes helped discover the influenza A virus. Three years later, 16-year-old Dennis Busby, who had joined the NIMR straight from school as a \u201clab boy\u201d, received the first ever flu vaccination. He was not paraded for the cameras like Margaret Keenan, the first in the world to receive an approved Covid vaccine. In those days, scientific breakthroughs happened more discreetly, and a vital global breakthrough went unmarked. The stories have become folklore among the virologists who have followed Andrewes down the years \u2013 a small group you can\u2019t help thinking were cultivated in the same petri dish. \u201cI knew Dennis Busby,\u201d McCauley says. \u201cHe was one of the best virological, technical guys.\u201d Busby went on to become head technician in the bacteriology and virus division of the NIMR, which moved to Mill Hill, London, in 1950. Was it ethical to jab him with an experimental vaccine at an age when most boys are at school? \u201cHe prepared it himself,\u201d McCauley says, almost proudly. McCauley\u2019s predecessor-but-one as head of the Worldwide Influenza Centre was Sir John Skehel, an eminent virologist who has shown, among other things, how the influenza virus enters human cells and how antibodies can block it. Skehel ran the centre from 1975 to 1993 and was director of the NIMR until 2006. \u201cWould you like to meet him?\u201d McCauley asks. And there he is, the 81-year-old recipient of a string of awards and honorary degrees, across the atrium from McCauley at the Crick, working in a similar small office, cheerful and welcoming. The two chat about the difficulties in tracking flu caused by the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get some virus in from Hong Kong, but there are no flights,\u201d McCauley says. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad,\u201d Skehel says. \u201cHong Kong is an important laboratory. They picked up H5N1 bird flu in 1997.\u201d In the past, Hong Kong has been a window on to what flu is doing in mainland China. It has excellent scientists, often trained in the UK and well known to their British counterparts, and some of the samples they collect are from southern China. As China takes an ever firmer grip of Hong Kong, it\u2019s uncertain whether the UK will continue to get those sorts of insights. Seven WHO global reference centres \u2013 the Crick, Atlanta and Memphis in the US, Beijing, Tokyo, Melbourne and Novosibirsk \u2013 lead flu surveillance around the world. Five are devoted to human flu; two watch for animal viruses that might jump to humans. They are on the alert for flu outbreaks in chickens in Egypt and pigs in Central America, seeing whether farm workers or families with animals get infected and start to infect others. Feeding into those WHO hubs are national influenza centres. In England, this is run by revered virologist Prof Maria Zambon at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). Zambon was one of the key members of the government\u2019s Sage advisory committee during the Covid pandemic, alongside her Imperial College colleague Prof Neil Ferguson. She is also an adviser to the WHO. And she never stops working. Decades ago, Zambon was part of the core influenza group at Mill Hill. There is a \u201cstrong historical thread\u201d running from Andrewes to the present day, she says. And she\u2019s not surprised so many of the people she knew a quarter of a century ago, such as Skehel, are still tackling flu. \u201cYou fall in love with working on viruses,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a very good start for me because I was surrounded by top-class scientists in a wonderful, collaborative environment. And you take that passion with you.\u201d Even when the world is engulfed in a pandemic caused by a different virus, flu really matters. \u201cWhichever way you look at it, it\u2019s a major public health threat. And we still haven\u2019t quite solved the problem,\u201d Zambon says. She is heavily involved in the response to Covid at UKHSA and Imperial College, where she is co-director of the NIHR health protection research unit. Was she surprised the pandemic that shut down the world was caused not by flu, as scientists had for so long predicted, but coronavirus? \u201cThe answer to that is yes,\u201d she says, \u201cand no. Coronaviruses have demonstrated their potential for causing havoc over a number of years.\u201d Zambon helped identify the first Sars virus in 2003, as one of an international team of virologists analysing samples from 436 patients in six countries. In 2012, she led the UK\u2019s efforts to understand another coronavirus, Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome), that turned up in two people who had travelled to the UK and spread to two others. She advised the WHO on it. \u201cWith both of those episodes, globally we dodged a bullet,\u201d she says. It\u2019s thanks to all that historical UK influenza effort that the world is in a better place to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. Not only is surveillance strong, but so is the UK\u2019s ability to assess how well vaccines are working through the matching of data on immunisation and illness. \u201cWe have a vaccine effectiveness system for Covid vaccines that is virtually second to none,\u201d she says. Zambon\u2019s team at the national influenza centre sends the Crick \u201cone or two examples of things that are absolutely representative. And then if we see anything unusual, or a bit weird, we\u2019ll give it to them as well. So they are getting a kind of digest of viruses from us.\u201d Each of the devolved UK administrations does its own collection and analysis of flu samples, and sends McCauley those they consider interesting. There can be variations in what you find even within regions, says Dr Catherine Moore, who heads flu surveillance at Public Health Wales. Her field is molecular diagnostics, investigating changes in human, viral and microbial genomes to diagnose diseases. She swung into action at the start of the Covid pandemic, developing a molecular assay diagnostics test (PCR) to detect its genetic material (RNA) within a month of the coronavirus being recognised. Moore knows Zambon and McCauley well, and shares their enthusiasm. She is \u201cthe current custodian\u201d of a system that has been running for 40 years, she says. It\u2019s \u201can absolute joy\u201d to be even a small cog in the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). What matters is not the number of flu samples they collect, she says, but gathering high-quality data that can indicate the drift of virus strains, potentially into something different and troublesome. They operate within the hospital system in Wales: \u201cWhat we want to look at is the severe end of the spectrum.\u201d That\u2019s all the way from a one-night stay to intensive care. Moore has 44 GP practices also feeding in test results. In England, there are 245, organised through a network run by the Royal College of General Practitioners. Since 1967, GPs have collated reports of flu diagnoses from selected practices around the country. In 1994, Zambon was involved in helping with the transition to a system where patients\u2019 flu samples are dispatched to centralised public health laboratories for virological testing. GPs used to be at the sharp end of all of this, swabbing their patients\u2019 throats for flu virus in the way we all now know how to do. Flu is easy to catch, so it was a high-risk occupation. Covid has changed things dramatically, and now people in low-risk groups with flu-like symptoms are able to request home test kits and submit their own samples. \u201cOne of the things the pandemic has done is ensure that much less explanation is needed now on how to take a swab,\u201d says Prof Simon de Lusignan, an academic GP at the University of Oxford who runs the network organising sample collection in England. A charity called TakeATestUK dispatches the flu kit. The patient does the throat swab and posts it off to Zambon\u2019s lab teams for analysis. GPs still feel they need to see some patients in person \u2013 such as older people who may have a chest infection, and small babies \u2013 but others will be told they are best staying warm, drinking fluids and getting over it at home. *** The vaccine strain selection meetings at the WHO started in the early 1970s and take place twice a year. In February, they recommend the virus cocktail to go into the northern hemisphere vaccine, with a meeting six months later for the southern hemisphere. The meeting used to recommend three strains. Now, manufacturing technology has improved to accommodate four. It is difficult stuff. Not every virus strain can be grown successfully \u2013 traditionally in chicken eggs \u2013 in the quantity needed (it is then deactivated). Usually, the committee gets it right, pretty much. \u201cWe normally say it\u2019s right something like 70 to 80% of the time, because what you\u2019re trying to do is to match a vaccine strain selection with a moving target,\u201d Zambon says. But it\u2019s an educated bet. You can see the runners and riders \u2013 the strains that are most prevalent in the world \u2013 but they can change within six months. \u201cThat\u2019s what you need the crystal ball for,\u201d she says. \u201cSome of the time, there\u2019ll be a runner that pops up by August or September that was not present in January or February and if that runner emerges, and is successful against the other riders, then you have a mismatch. It does happen, and it can be painful when it does.\u201d A mismatch is the nightmare. The experts got it wrong in 2014-15. The vaccine protected against Flu B and the H1N1 strain of Flu A, but not against H3N2. In February 2014, the Geneva meeting had opted for the Texas strain of H3N2, kickstarting manufacture of the vaccine across Europe and the US. But as early as March, the flu watchers could see that a different strain of H3N2, from Switzerland, was spreading faster. \u201cIt dominated in the winter of 2014-15,\u201d McCauley says. It was too late to switch horses. If vaccine production had been stopped to make a change in the component strains, there would not have been enough of it. That year, there were an estimated 43,900 excess winter deaths in England and Wales \u2013 the largest number since 1999-2000. Something odd is happening with Flu B, too. For some time, the two B strains in the vaccine have been Victoria and Yamagata. Now Yamagata seems to have disappeared. \u201cAt the start of 2018, half the intensive care unit beds in the UK were filled with people with B Yamagata lineage viruses,\u201d McCauley says. \u201cNow it might have shot its bolt. We haven\u2019t seen a B Yamagata lineage virus for over a year in these laboratories.\u201d What\u2019s going on? The experts don\u2019t know, exactly. The flu hunters trail influenza but can never get ahead of it. And right now, predicting what it will do next is difficult. Strange things are happening. Not only has Yamagata vanished, but China has reported only Flu B and no Flu A, the animal variety \u2013 so the speculation is that it\u2019s not circulating. And in the US, neither Yamagata nor one of the substrains of H3N2 (which doesn\u2019t have a place name) has been spotted since March 2020. The answer must have to do with the Covid pandemic. McCauley produces a slide that dramatically demonstrates what happened in the winter of 2020-21, the first of the pandemic. Flu went into lockdown; there wasn\u2019t any to speak of. Social distancing and mask-wearing thwarted not just coronavirus but flu, too. At the Crick, they were able to clear a backlog of work. They hadn\u2019t been able to do that since 2008. \u201cLast year, we did have periods when we didn\u2019t have stuff to do,\u201d McCauley says with a grin. But if there are fewer reports of flu, is that really because of all the social distancing and mask-wearing? Or is it that people are not going to the GP or hospital and instead are staying at home in bed with a raging fever unnoticed? Moore in Wales says it\u2019s been hard to read. \u201cBecause of the pandemic, a lot of our surveillance systems have been disrupted, and particularly in the community.\u201d But, on the whole, it seems there genuinely is less flu. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite remarkable. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen anything like this in my entire career,\u201d she says. In 2019, before the pandemic hit, things were looking dodgy. \u201cWe were in a really brisk season,\u201d she says. There were four H3N2 substrains circulating in Wales, at least two of which were not great matches for the strain in the vaccine. Moore was expecting a tricky winter. \u201cThen suddenly Sars [Covid-19] arrived,\u201d she says. Because of mitigations such as social distancing, masks and working from home, \u201cflu stopped circulating. We\u2019ve had two years of basically nothing. No signal at all for influenza.\u201d It\u2019s no different in the rest of Europe. Flu can vanish \u2013 and flu can come roaring back. McCauley and the committee have chosen their strains for next winter. It includes a B Yamagata-type strain (Phuket) in spite of its apparent disappearance, along with H1N1 (Victoria), H3N2 (Darwin) and B (Austria). \u201cIt is far too early to conclude it [Yamagata] is extinct,\u201d he says. And not much flu means there is less natural immunity against it. People don\u2019t have the antibodies from getting ill; at least, not the antibodies from recent strains. All of us have some baseline immunity to flu. People born before about 1957 have some resilience to H1N1. It lurked for 40 or so years after the 1918 pandemic, altered in substrains, but older people have some general protection against it all the same. That\u2019s why, in 2009 \u2013 the swine flu pandemic, which was also H1N1 \u2013 it was working people, aged 25 to 35, who died. Have I heard of \u201coriginal antigenic sin\u201d, Moore asks. The first flu strain you came into contact with is what your immune system remembers best, she explains. \u201cThat\u2019s your immune system\u2019s memory. If you encountered H1N1 as a child, you will be better protected against strains of that than against those of H3N2. And those born in the few years before the 1968-69 Hong Kong flu pandemic are likely to have more immunity to H3N2, which caused it. So H3N2 hits elderly people harder.\u201d Flu travels the world. It may start in Hong Kong or in Bangladesh, but there are no border controls. Global cooperation is essential, and that includes sharing samples of virus \u2013 carefully. McCauley won\u2019t send flu virus to countries whose labs are anything less than highly secure. He mentions a country that asked for samples from the UK for comparison purposes. He wasn\u2019t impressed with their safety protocols. \u201cI said, \u2018Would you accept Ebola? Would you do this with Ebola?\u2019 And they went, \u2018No, no, we wouldn\u2019t do that.\u2019 I said, \u2018OK, so Ebola kills 70% of people. And this virus kills 40% of people that it infects. What\u2019s the difference?\u2019\u201d *** The flu hunters have decades of experience but there are always anxious moments. Moore is concerned about Alan Gosling and his Muscovy ducks. The ducks were infected because, while human flu is at low levels, bird flu in the UK is not. \u201cWe\u2019re right in the middle of a massive epidemic in our birds in the UK,\u201d she says. She cannot understand the lack of interest. \u201cWe have a human infection from it and birds are dying. Nobody seems to care, but it\u2019s part of the same family of viruses. I find it remarkable that flu has been denigrated almost to just a cold. It\u2019s not. It kills people every year, and it\u2019s distressing.\u201d After the coronavirus pandemic is over, she says, people need to be reminded to take flu seriously. In some respects, we are getting on top of flu. Conall Watson, a UKHSA epidemiologist, talks of \u201creally positive developments in flu vaccinations\u201d. He means the introduction of the adjuvant influenza vaccine, which gives older people\u2019s immune systems a boost to help them respond and produce antibodies to the strains in the jab. \u201cWe\u2019ve got evidence that it is preventing hospitalisations, but one of the really big steps the UK took was the introduction of a school-age and toddler vaccination programme,\u201d he says, \u201cwith the idea of using vaccines to reduce community transmission.\u201d And the mRNA technology that has proved so successful in the Covid pandemic, used in the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, is likely to be the future for flu vaccines as well. The companies are now looking to see how they can adapt it. We know mRNA vaccines can be fairly swiftly altered if a serious new coronavirus variant turns up. We could see a scenario where both the Covid and flu vaccines are redesigned every year, depending on the prevailing strains. Will we ever get to a point where we don\u2019t have to worry about flu? \u201cNo,\u201d Zambon says, without hesitation, \u201cbecause the natural reservoir for influenza A is wild birds.\u201d They take the virus around the globe and there is nothing we can do about it. \u201cSo it will always be a threat to the human population.\u201d Which means that our best hope will continue to be vaccines. We are in the hands of the flu hunters.",

      "body": "<p><strong>What is bullying?<br></strong>It\u2019s a sustained pattern of aggression by a person with more power, targeting someone with less power. The key, says Stella O\u2019Malley, author of a ground-breaking new book, <a href=\"http://www.stellaomalley.com/bullyproof-kids\" title=\"\">Bully-Proof Kids</a>, is that it\u2019s repeated behaviour. But beneath this simple definition lies a complex, multilayered situation that can be exceptionally tricky to unpack. What is the power, and where does it come from? With children, says O\u2019Malley, it\u2019s often that they have more social status, or have been led to believe they do.</p> <p>One very big issue, which she returns to time and again in her book and in our conversation, is that bullying is always about more than what\u2019s going on with two people: the bully and the target. What about the children O\u2019Malley calls \u201cwingmen\u201d, the bully\u2019s supporters, the kids who think the bully is the bee\u2019s knees and want to stay in their favour? What\u2019s happening with the kids watching silently \u2013 the bystanders? Who is seeing what\u2019s happening, when it all starts to kick off, and getting out fast? Who\u2019s calling out the injustice? To understand bullying, you have to see the whole picture.</p> <p>Because, says O\u2019Malley, bullying is about absolutely everyone in the group, room, office or playground; even the bystanders \u2013 those who do or say nothing when bullying is taking place \u2013 because, as the German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer said, not to speak is to speak; not to act is to act.</p> <p><strong>Could any kid be a bully</strong><strong> \u2013 and a target?<br></strong>Yes, says O\u2019Malley. \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone who I\u2019ve thought could never be a bully, or anyone who could never be a target. The truth is that every single one of us has our shadow side \u2013 and it\u2019s not until we can acknowledge it that we become better people.\u201d</p> <p>Bullying behaviour in children, says O\u2019Malley, tends to be very animalistic, with a strong instinct in many kids to join the pack. \u201cMaybe it takes 18 years to civilise ourselves, and that\u2019s where parents come in. There\u2019s so much we can do to make a difference.\u201d</p> <p><strong>What can parents do?<br></strong>The most important thing, says O\u2019Malley, is to pay attention to your child, so you can work out what their vulnerabilities are. You know your child better than anyone: what are their emotional needs? Do they need love and belonging, or crave power, status and recognition from others? The first of these could be a passive, gentle child who might be more vulnerable to bullying, or to being recruited by a bully to be one of their supporters. Similarly, if your child needs power and recognition \u2013 and that\u2019s a great cocktail for success in many sectors \u2013 it can easily trigger bullying behaviour, and as a parent you need to be aware of that, and active in how you manage it.</p> <p>\u201cA kid like this has wonderful strengths, but they need to learn empathy,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you can nurture a sense of kindness in that child, help them understand how others are feeling, you\u2019ll be combatting their bullying tendencies. Every child, every human being, has their flaws. Bullying has become demonised, but children can easily tip into it, and we need to help them out of it.\u201d And the good thing, says O\u2019Malley, is that it\u2019s relatively easy to help a primary-school-age child out of being a bully. \u201cThey\u2019re primed to be told how to behave, and they can learn to be different.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1e2d245f44d666166c676dd7c5bb31b7d7991e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1e2d245f44d666166c676dd7c5bb31b7d7991e9/0_0_898_957/469.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration: A child says unintelligible bad things about another\" width=\"469\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>What if the parents are bullies themselves?<br></strong>Sometimes you come across a family where everyone is a bully: the parents, the older siblings, who bully the younger kids, and the younger kids, who bully others at school. These families are very difficult to help; but they\u2019re also quite rare. What\u2019s much more common is individualistic behaviour by parents that could set their child up to be a bully.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>One of the biggest gifts a parent can give their child is the skills to handle tricky people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>What sort of behaviour should I look out for?<br></strong>There\u2019s a certain sort of kid, warns O\u2019Malley, who goes to school with a supercilious presumption that they\u2019re better than the others. Make sure your child isn\u2019t that child: the idea that your offspring is inherently smarter, better looking and more skilled across the board, is, in fact, a facet of your own dark side \u2013 and transmitting it to your child will lead to big problems.</p> <p>The much better approach is to think from the point of view of other children, and to encourage your child to do likewise. \u201cWhen asking your child about their day, don\u2019t just ask about lessons and what they had for lunch,\u201d says O\u2019Malley. \u201cAsk them, did everyone have a friend at playtime today? And if they say someone was left out, ask them did they give that person a smile, or go to ask whether they wanted to play?\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Malley prefers the term \u201ctricky people\u201d to \u201cbullies\u201d, and the truth about tricky people is this: they\u2019re all around, and they\u2019ll continue to be all around, right through your life. One of the biggest gifts a parent can give their child, O\u2019Malley believes, is the skills to handle tricky people. \u201cIt\u2019s not about being big; it\u2019s about being clever,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about your strategy, it\u2019s about how you deal with these people. If you teach your kid that some people are pure evil, and will beat you, it\u2019s not empowering. But if you teach them to recognise the tricky person, to be wary, to work things out around them: that\u2019s empowering. You\u2019ve taught them something massive.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind the scenes look at the making of the magazine\u2019s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind the scenes look at the making of the magazine\u2019s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Who are \u2018upstanders\u2019?<br></strong>There is another group and it\u2019s one O\u2019Malley wants to emphasise: the upstanders (she\u2019s one herself; indeed her book is a kind of upstanding writ large). \u201cThe upstanders weigh in. They\u2019re wired to weigh in \u2013 even when it\u2019s nothing to do with them,\u201d she says. \u201cThey can be really annoying people, actually.\u201d</p> <p>But upstanders deflate the bully or bullies and the important thing to realise, and to make sure your child realises, is that it can be a very subtle role. \u201cIf you\u2019re on public transport and someone is giving someone else racial abuse, even by just making eye contact with the target, and giving them a supportive look, helps reduce the bullying. Crossing the carriage to stand by them, maybe engaging them in conversation about the journey or the weather, will help reduce the power of the bully.\u201d O\u2019Malley\u2019s mantra is to embrace the role of the upstander \u2013 and in schools in particular, she thinks nurturing an upstanding culture would make a huge difference.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ceeb0ff70dad1790e2f17a322434e0d8847cfff8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ceeb0ff70dad1790e2f17a322434e0d8847cfff8/0_93_2776_1758/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration: a child in bed at night, concealing their phone from a parent\" width=\"1000\" height=\"633\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Has digitisation changed the nature of bullying, or has it merely given it a new arena?<br></strong>Bullying in the digital age is the same as the old, says O\u2019Malley, but there are important differences.

On social media, celebrities can give the aura of being so successful, so good-looking, so much the inhabitants of another universe, that it\u2019s easy to turn on them. The tragedy of Caroline Flack is one example O\u2019Malley gives: \u201cWe\u2019ve created a culture where to press \u2018like\u2019 makes you part of the mob, makes you a bystander.

Not only was bestselling author Julia Quinn \u2013 a <em>New</em> Englander! \u2013 playing Jane Austen and spilling sex all over the page, but her adaptation would feature a multiracial cast. It had all the ingredients of a giant flop, and might well have been if someone other than Shonda Rhimes had been stirring the pot.</p> <p>With Bridgerton\u2019s second season premiering this Friday, viewers will be logging on to Netflix in droves to see if the series was indeed a worthy rival to Downton Abbey, or if it merely exploited our collective cabin fever during the pandemic. But if there\u2019s reason to believe the series is more than a fleeting guilty pleasure, it\u2019s because few showrunners have a better track record of spinning TV gold than Rhimes \u2013 the 52-year-old Chicago native who has ruled the small screen for the better part of the past two decades. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d439c3f6d3066aa191339bc53c470fa61b9c97fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d439c3f6d3066aa191339bc53c470fa61b9c97fd/0_120_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charithra Chandran as Edwina Sharma and Simone Ashley as Kate Sharma in Bridgerton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charithra Chandran as Edwina Sharma and Simone Ashley as Kate Sharma in Bridgerton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liam Daniel/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The hot streak has continued at Netflix \u2013 where her initial offerings have her reigning supreme. Not only has Bridgerton gone on to runaway success, zooming to No 1 in 76 countries, with a viewership of 82m households on the way to becoming the second-most watched series by total watch time on the platform. But Rhimes\u2019s follow-up, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/16/inventing-anna-netflix-review\">Inventing Anna</a> \u2013 about the soon-to-be deported SoHo grifter Anna Delvey \u2013 has proved to be a cultural phenomenon as well, seizing on the current scammer culture zeitgeist. Of course for those versed in Rhimes\u2019s work, with its hot-mess characters and soaring monologues, doubtless none of this comes as a shock. If there\u2019s one thing Rhimes knows how to make, it\u2019s eminently binge-worthy TV.</p> <p>Rhimes, of course, is the big brain behind Grey\u2019s Anatomy, the soapy hospital drama that debuted on ABC as a mid-season replacement in 2005 only to become one of the longest-running scripted shows on American television. (In January, ABC renewed Grey\u2019s for a 19th season.) The series minted the careers of Sandra Oh, Katherine Heigl and Jesse Williams; most incredibly, it established 52-year-old Ellen Pompeo \u2013 the titular Grey \u2013 as top earner in a medium that favours much younger up-and-comers. Grey\u2019s even spawned two spin-offs: the firehouse-based Station 19 (renewed for a sixth season in January) and the medical office drama Private Practice, which enjoyed a six-season run before getting the axe in 2013.</p> <p>But Rhimes was only just getting warmed up. After Grey\u2019s she came out with Scandal, the Kerry Washington-led series based on a real-life DC politico; and How to Get Away with Murder, the fast-paced legal drama that won Viola Davis an Emmy. For years, Rhimes had ABC\u2019s Thursday nights all to herself, with Grey\u2019s, Scandal and Murder all airing the same evening. Altogether, she was creating at a pace that even the prolific actor and director Tyler Perry would struggle to keep up with, producing about 70 hours of television a year while banking in excess of $2bn for parent company Disney.</p> <p>Despite her rainmaking, Rhimes was grossly underpaid at the network \u2013 a fact that became apparent during their negotiations for a multiyear extension in 2017. The final straw came when she asked a high-ranking executive for an extra all-inclusive pass to Disneyland. The alleged reply (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/shonda-rhimes-is-ready-to-own-her-s-the-game-changing-showrunner-on-leaving-abc-culture-shock-at-netflix-and-overcoming-her-fears-4079375/\">Don\u2019t you have enough</a>?\u201d) all but sent her running to Netflix \u2013 where she\u2019d be free of network TV\u2019s tight shackles.

It looks as if volcanic eruptions caused climate change as well. The dinosaurs that survived were the birds., 2:B - Commemorative 50p coins feature megalosaurus, iguanodon, hylaeosaurus, temnodontosaurus, plesiosaurus and dimorphodon. But you can\u2019t use them for payment., 3:B - Yes, when a whale farts you can see bubbles coming out of its bottom! Lots of animals fart, and dinosaurs could probably fart. If you have a pet dog, you\u2019ll know that dogs can! We think all mammals fart except sloths., 4:A - Human skin contains a pigment called melanin, which gives the skin its colour. People with lots of melanin have naturally darker skin. When the sun shines on skin, it creates more melanin., 5:D - The sunlight zone is at the top of the ocean, where there\u2019s lots of sunlight. Below that comes the twilight zone, where there is only a little light. In the midnight zone, it\u2019s pitch black.

Already difficult patterns of living, often just survival, were abruptly disrupted as the city emptied and shut down during spikes. Shelters and food pantries no longer functioned in a predictable fashion. Stores and 24-hour subways closed and the homeless were often and conveniently blamed for a wave of robbery and violence. But last weekend, matters became bleaker still: the terrifying specter of a gunman on the prowl who over the last two weeks shot five homeless men sleeping on the streets of Washington DC and New York, killing one in each city. Law enforcement officials described the man as a serial killer; the mayors of both cities offered a reward for information and issued advisories to get off the streets, a puzzling directive since the streets are home to the killers\u2019 targets. The alert was withdrawn by Tuesday when federal agents took 30-year-old Gerald Brevard into custody in south-east Washington. No motive has been given, and he has yet to be charged. But the casual nature of the extreme violence \u2013 captured on surveillance video \u2013 has underscored the vulnerability of tens of thousands of people for whom rest is a sporadic luxury and safety relative in a city that never sleeps. \u201cIt took hours and tons of stress to make even five dollars\u201d during the Covid shutdowns, said Sophie, a 25-year-old woman who has lived on the streets around Washington Square Park in Manhattan. \u201cThere was nothing open, no one on the streets, nothing in the garbage cans and you couldn\u2019t even get water after eight during the curfew.

      "body": "<p>Since his premiership nearly sank a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson has done more foreign travel and frantic diplomacy than in all his previous years as prime minister combined.</p> <p>He has made phone calls almost daily to Volodymyr Zelenskiy as the war with Russia rages, and won praise from the Ukrainian president during his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/08/zelenskiy-brings-down-the-house-with-his-speech-to-the-commons\">emotive video address</a> to the House of Commons.</p> <p>And he has flitted to Kyiv, Munich, Poland, Estonia, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia, as he tries to position himself as an international powerbroker in the new post-Brexit order, galvanising action against the Kremlin and dealing with the consequent shortfall in non-Russian energy supplies.</p> <p>Johnson is also likely to attend a Nato summit next week in Brussels, alongside the US president, Joe Biden, but the American leader is not currently thought to have any plans to make a detour to London.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost like he\u2019s worried he won\u2019t have many more opportunities to play the international statesman and his next tour is going to be on the lecture circuit,\u201d said one unsympathetic Tory MP who also pointed to Johnson being forced to make friends with \u201csecond-tier\u201d leaders rather than Biden, Olaf Scholz or Emmanuel Macron.</p> <p>But some in Johnson\u2019s party are impressed. Some Conservative backbenchers claim to have been won round by Johnson\u2019s decision to apply himself proactively to the international crisis triggered by Russia\u2019s decision to invade Ukraine.</p> <p>At least two \u2013 out of more than a dozen \u2013 Conservative MPs have now withdrawn letters of no confidence in their leader, saying now is not the time for a change. And Johnson himself appears to have gained new vigour, after coming so close to being ousted.</p> <p>Although he was widely seen as a chaotic and gaffe-prone foreign secretary, with insufficient grasp of diplomatic details, those close to the prime minister say it is a part of the job that interests him much more than domestic policy detail. As a politician with a lifelong obsession with Winston Churchill, Johnson appears to be in his element in the role of war leader \u2013 despite the UK not being directly involved in the conflict. One person present on his latest trip to the Gulf said he appeared far happier this week meeting world leaders and having his photograph taken than he was \u201csitting behind a desk\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis could be like Boris\u2019s Falklands moment,\u201d said Ryan Shorthouse, the chief executive of the Conservative thinktank Bright Blue. \u201cThe polls seem to indicate that the fall in support for the Conservatives seems to have stopped as a result of the crisis in eastern Europe, which would indicate that the public consciousness has moved on from the breaking of rules inside No 10.\u201d</p> <p>He added that the crisis had \u201ctaken away the story from Partygate\u201d, just as the Covid pandemic \u201cmasked some of the consequences of Brexit\u201d.</p> <p>Like his foreign secretary, Liz Truss, whose Instagram profile channels Margaret Thatcher with pictures of her driving a tank, Johnson has used the international crisis to burnish his image. It has given him endless opportunities to be pictured in front of union flags, walking down red carpets and shaking hands with dignitaries.</p> <p>On many of the trips, journalists have not been given access, apart from one broadcaster and one wire reporter, so there is little visibility about what Johnson is doing \u2013 or promising \u2013 to his fellow international leaders while out of the country. For his visit to Ukraine in early February, the media were told there was \u201cno room\u201d on the 300-seat taxpayer-funded plane.</p> <p>And for his visits to UAE and Saudi Arabia, where Johnson was explicitly going to seek deals for more oil and investment, he also excluded the majority of the press. Accompanying him was Gerry Grimstone, a trade minister who is a former adviser to the Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and who has had deep business links with the Middle East.</p> <p>Part of the prime minister\u2019s buoyancy is because his allies believe the plot against his premiership is over, with one telling the Daily Mail on Thursday that he would not lose a leadership challenge even if handed a penalty by the police. They are now confident he will fight the next general election and win. One Tory MP with a tin ear told the Guardian that the war in Ukraine meant \u201cthe mood is now really good in the party\u201d.</p> <p>Domestically, Johnson\u2019s activities also have the feel of a soft relaunch of his premiership, with the Tory chair saying a two-year election campaign would start from this May. The prime minister is speaking on Friday at the Scottish Conservatives\u2019 conference, before heading to Blackpool on Saturday for the Tory spring conference \u2013 the first time in years that the event has been billed as a major event.</p> <p>The aim is to convince the party faithful that Johnson\u2019s premiership is worth fighting for as the crucial May elections approach and to entrench him as the incumbent candidate, putting him back in campaign mode.

      "bodyText": "Since his premiership nearly sank a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson has done more foreign travel and frantic diplomacy than in all his previous years as prime minister combined. He has made phone calls almost daily to Volodymyr Zelenskiy as the war with Russia rages, and won praise from the Ukrainian president during his emotive video address to the House of Commons. And he has flitted to Kyiv, Munich, Poland, Estonia, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia, as he tries to position himself as an international powerbroker in the new post-Brexit order, galvanising action against the Kremlin and dealing with the consequent shortfall in non-Russian energy supplies. Johnson is also likely to attend a Nato summit next week in Brussels, alongside the US president, Joe Biden, but the American leader is not currently thought to have any plans to make a detour to London. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like he\u2019s worried he won\u2019t have many more opportunities to play the international statesman and his next tour is going to be on the lecture circuit,\u201d said one unsympathetic Tory MP who also pointed to Johnson being forced to make friends with \u201csecond-tier\u201d leaders rather than Biden, Olaf Scholz or Emmanuel Macron. But some in Johnson\u2019s party are impressed. Some Conservative backbenchers claim to have been won round by Johnson\u2019s decision to apply himself proactively to the international crisis triggered by Russia\u2019s decision to invade Ukraine. At least two \u2013 out of more than a dozen \u2013 Conservative MPs have now withdrawn letters of no confidence in their leader, saying now is not the time for a change. And Johnson himself appears to have gained new vigour, after coming so close to being ousted. Although he was widely seen as a chaotic and gaffe-prone foreign secretary, with insufficient grasp of diplomatic details, those close to the prime minister say it is a part of the job that interests him much more than domestic policy detail. As a politician with a lifelong obsession with Winston Churchill, Johnson appears to be in his element in the role of war leader \u2013 despite the UK not being directly involved in the conflict. One person present on his latest trip to the Gulf said he appeared far happier this week meeting world leaders and having his photograph taken than he was \u201csitting behind a desk\u201d. \u201cThis could be like Boris\u2019s Falklands moment,\u201d said Ryan Shorthouse, the chief executive of the Conservative thinktank Bright Blue. \u201cThe polls seem to indicate that the fall in support for the Conservatives seems to have stopped as a result of the crisis in eastern Europe, which would indicate that the public consciousness has moved on from the breaking of rules inside No 10.\u201d He added that the crisis had \u201ctaken away the story from Partygate\u201d, just as the Covid pandemic \u201cmasked some of the consequences of Brexit\u201d. Like his foreign secretary, Liz Truss, whose Instagram profile channels Margaret Thatcher with pictures of her driving a tank, Johnson has used the international crisis to burnish his image. It has given him endless opportunities to be pictured in front of union flags, walking down red carpets and shaking hands with dignitaries. On many of the trips, journalists have not been given access, apart from one broadcaster and one wire reporter, so there is little visibility about what Johnson is doing \u2013 or promising \u2013 to his fellow international leaders while out of the country. For his visit to Ukraine in early February, the media were told there was \u201cno room\u201d on the 300-seat taxpayer-funded plane. And for his visits to UAE and Saudi Arabia, where Johnson was explicitly going to seek deals for more oil and investment, he also excluded the majority of the press. Accompanying him was Gerry Grimstone, a trade minister who is a former adviser to the Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and who has had deep business links with the Middle East. Part of the prime minister\u2019s buoyancy is because his allies believe the plot against his premiership is over, with one telling the Daily Mail on Thursday that he would not lose a leadership challenge even if handed a penalty by the police. They are now confident he will fight the next general election and win. One Tory MP with a tin ear told the Guardian that the war in Ukraine meant \u201cthe mood is now really good in the party\u201d. Domestically, Johnson\u2019s activities also have the feel of a soft relaunch of his premiership, with the Tory chair saying a two-year election campaign would start from this May. The prime minister is speaking on Friday at the Scottish Conservatives\u2019 conference, before heading to Blackpool on Saturday for the Tory spring conference \u2013 the first time in years that the event has been billed as a major event. The aim is to convince the party faithful that Johnson\u2019s premiership is worth fighting for as the crucial May elections approach and to entrench him as the incumbent candidate, putting him back in campaign mode. In his foreword to the spring conference guide, the prime minister said his argument would be \u201can optimistic vision for the future of our country\u201d. Those keeping a close eye on the public find a more mixed picture, however. Some Conservative MPs report voters may be distracted by the pressures of the cost of living crisis and worry over the Ukraine-Russia conflict, but many have not changed their minds that the prime minister should have resigned. \u201cThey\u2019re saying he\u2019s done better in relation to Ukraine but they haven\u2019t forgotten the cake,\u201d said one veteran Tory former cabinet minister. Robert Hayward, a Conservative peer and elections expert, said the impact of the Ukraine crisis on Johnson\u2019s reputation \u201chas two effects: one is the leadership effect, and there are signs that Macron and, to a lesser extent, Biden are having the same benefit. And then there\u2019s a second effect, the obliteration factor, which is that by keeping on the page dealing with an international drama such as this, you hide other things.\u201d Luke Tryl, a former Conservative aide and a UK director of More in Common, who has been carrying out regular focus groups with voters across the country, said the crisis \u201cdefinitely changes the subject\u201d. \u201cWhereas at the start of February, the first thing people would come to when you asked them about stuff they\u2019d seen in the news was Partygate, now, everyone says Ukraine,\u201d he said. But he was not convinced the public were warming to Johnson the international statesman. \u201cSome of the stuff that people quite liked about Boris, they now see as a little bit of a liability when we\u2019re dealing with an invasion, a major international event. In some red wall groups we\u2019ve had people say things like, \u2018What do the other world leaders think of the fact that he doesn\u2019t do his hair?\u2019\u201d He added: \u201cIf you prompt them on Partygate, they come back with the same level of crossness. It\u2019s suspended it in time. If you ask about what should happen if he gets a fixed-penalty fine, people normally say some version of, \u2018Well he obviously should resign; I don\u2019t think he will though.\u2019\u201d",

Here\u2019s a recap of the day\u2019s top stories: Voters in South Australia will decide the fate of the first-term Liberal government, led by the premier, Steven Marshall. Recent opinion polls have put Labor in a commanding position, but the opposition leader, Peter Malinauskas, said today he expected the result to be close. Marshall said he was \u201cnot that fussed\u201d by polls predicting a Labor win. There were 46,422 new Covid infections and 24 deaths reported across the country today. New case numbers nationally have risen by 37% in the past week, linked to the more transmissible BA.2 Omicron subvariant. The federal opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said the late senator Kimberley Kitching never raised complaints of bullying with him, and labelled political debate about her death as \u201cnot constructive\u201d. Hillsong apologised after internal investigations concluded its founder, Brian Houston, engaged in \u201cinappropriate\u201d behaviour. Enjoy your night! While we\u2019re on the topic of climate change, temperatures in Antarctica are unusually high at the moment. At Concordia station, recorded temperatures have been about 40C above average. Yes, you read that correctly. A tweet from Prof Terry Hughes, who this week warned that a sixth mass bleaching event was now unfolding on the reef \u2013 on top of events in 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017 and 2020. As Lisa mentioned on the blog earlier, a 10-day UN monitoring mission to the reef is due to start on Monday. AAP is reporting some sad news out of northern NSW: NSW police believe a body found in the Tweed River is that of a man who jumped off a boat in the early hours of Saturday morning. Officers were called at about 2.30am following reports the man had jumped off the boat moored near Chinderah in the state\u2019s north. A search of the river and foreshore began soon after and a body was found in the water nearby at about 2.40pm. The body is yet to be identified, but officers believe it is the same man. An investigation into the circumstances of the incident is under way and a report will be prepared for the coroner. The Northern Territory police officer Zachary Rolfe was allegedly violent during the arrests of four Aboriginal men or boys who required medical treatment in a two-year period before fatally shooting Kumanjayi Walker. After three of the incidents he was also alleged to have falsified reports, and on one occasion was accused of asking a fellow officer to scratch him to make it appear as if he had been harmed by an offender during an arrest. Read the full story here: The NSW government is set to spend an extra $4.4m on shark mitigation following an attack at Sydney\u2019s Little Bay last month, the first fatal incident in nearly 60 years. The minister for agriculture, Dugald Saunders, said: The tragic event at Little Bay earlier this year was another reminder of the threat posed by sharks and the need to take steps to ensure we can coexist as safely as possible. We are not only announcing immediate additional response capabilities, including more shark listening stations, Smart drum lines and rapid response vehicles, we\u2019re also committing to ongoing funding for future mitigation to protect our beachgoers for years to come. AAP has the story: The announcement follows the death in February of a 35-year-old man after he was attacked by what was believed to be four-and-a-half-metre great white shark at Little Bay. The immediate package includes a long-range drone trial in partnership with Surf Life Saving NSW and research into wetsuit materials that reduce the impact of attacks. Also included in the state\u2019s $85.6m shark management program for 2022-26 is the extension of 51 nets currently deployed seasonally and funding for Surfing NSW to provide services like trauma kits during competitions. Exhibit A: democracy sausage. Exhibit B: democracy dog. Exhibit C: negative pencil review. Polls in South Australia will be closing in two hours. In the meantime, here\u2019s some analysis from psephologist extraordinaire Antony Green: Canberrans are being reminded to avoid wild mushrooms after a young child who ingested a death cap mushroom was hospitalised, AAP reports: Acting ACT chief health officer Dr Vanessa Johnston said the child presented to a hospital emergency department on Friday. ACT Health could not confirm the child\u2019s condition, but Johnston said it was a reminder for people to be careful around wild mushrooms. The ACT government undertakes routine site inspections at known, high-yielding sites on a weekly basis between February and June. Death cap mushrooms were on Friday detected around Canberra and removed. The deadly mushrooms often grow near established oak trees and can easily be mistaken for edible mushrooms. Wild mushrooms should not be touched with bare hands, and children and animals should be kept away from them. People should urgently attend an emergency department if they believe they\u2019ve eaten a wild mushroom. They should also take any remaining mushroom to the hospital for identification. Wet weather along Australia\u2019s east coast has led to an early bumper season, with experts warning about the risks of poisoning \u2013 as Sydney man Jonathan Herrman learned the hard way a few weeks ago. You can read more about that here: Thanks Lisa! I\u2019ll be with you in the hot seat into the evening. As always, if you spot anything or have any tips to share, please email Donna.Lu@theguardian.com or tweet me at @donnadlu. If you haven\u2019t already gotten to it, this piece by our inequality reporter, Stephanie Convery, on the effects of Australia\u2019s rising cost of living, is a really worthwhile read. In it she details the experiences of Julie-Marie Hay, a Perth nurse and single mother of three, who now struggles to make ends meet. In 2021, workers earning the average income of $68,000 effectively had a pay cut of $832, as price increases outstripped minor salary increases. You can read the full story here: That\u2019s where I\u2019m going to leave you for the day. My excellent colleague Donna Lu will take you through the rest of the afternoon as we near the closing of the polls in the South Australian election. Enjoy the rest of your weekend. Hillsong has been forced to \u201capologise unreservedly\u201d after the church\u2019s founder, Brian Houston, was found to have engaged in conduct \u201cof serious concern\u201d by the church. Following media reports on Friday, the church\u2019s global board said in a statement that Houston had breached Hillsong\u2019s pastor code of conduct in two incidents over the past decade. \u201cWe have sadly been dealing with two complaints made against Pastor Brian over the last 10 years,\u201d the church\u2019s global board said. Read our story here: The Queensland government has announced plans for a $771m flood relief package that would allow affected residents to retrofit, elevate or sell back their homes, pending commonwealth support. AAP reports: Up to 500 Queenslanders hit by the south-east floods will be able to access a home buyback scheme under a new support package released by the state. The government has asked the commonwealth for joint funding support for the $771m package under national disaster recovery arrangements, the deputy premier, Steven Miles, said on Saturday. A key element of the package is giving affected Queenslanders the option to retrofit, raise or sell back their flood-affected homes. It includes $275m to retrofit 5,500 homes, $100m to elevate 1,000 homes and a $350m residential buyback program. \u201cThis is the biggest potential buyback ... fund we\u2019ve ever had available to us. We anticipate that will allow us to buy back 500 properties if people want to,\u201d Miles told reporters. Guidelines to determine which residents can access specific options still need to be finalised. I\u2019m going to draw your attention to a story we published late yesterday that you may have missed. Dead corals are being recorded in aerial surveys across the Great Barrier Reef in what the marine park\u2019s chief scientist says is a widespread and serious bleaching event on the world heritage icon. Aerial surveys have covered half of the 2,300km reef, with the worst bleaching observed in the park\u2019s central region off Townsville, where corals on some reefs are dead and dying. The unfolding bleaching comes ahead of a 10-day UN monitoring mission to the reef due to start on Monday. You can read the story by my environment colleague Graham Readfearn here: Western Australia has reported its Covid numbers. Four people have died \u2013 one of those deaths was historical and first reported to WA Health yesterday \u2013 and 147 people are in hospital, four of whom are in intensive care. The state has recorded 5,838 new cases. The leader of the Australian Greens, Adam Bandt, will attend tonight\u2019s 50th anniversary celebrations for the green movement in Tasmania, marking a full half-century since local protests against the destruction of Lake Pedder. Bandt says he will outline the party\u2019s successes over the past 50 years of political and social movements and give an outline of the Greens\u2019 election platform for Tasmania ahead of the upcoming federal election. He will appear alongside candidates for the lower house and senator Peter Whish-Wilson. He says protection for forests, climate action, housing and the expansion of Medicare are a priority: This election is going to be closer than you think \u2013 and it\u2019s going to be a choice between candidates that continue the old way of tearing up our forests and killing our planet, and the Greens, who will protect our natural world and build a more equal, compassionate society for Tasmania. Read our story on the rowdy meeting at Hobart town hall 50 years ago that led to the formation of the world\u2019s first green party: Some more from Anthony Albanese, who is giving a press conference on the NSW Central Coast. He says his door is open to every caucus member and no one is ever denied a meeting. He says: I received no complaints about the treatment of senator Kitching ... at any time. That is just a fact. That is not to say that, of course, from time to time in politics, it\u2019s a competitive business, it is one where I think we could all be kinder to each other, frankly, but within the parliament, within our own parties, and across the aisle, and I would always urge people to do so. I am an inclusive leader. He says the politicisation of the senator\u2019s death is \u201cnot constructive\u201d: I\u2019ve got to say, [I] think this is an unfortunate discussion to have [a few] days before a funeral of someone, but the media continues to ask these questions and that is unfortunate. The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, is speaking at Avoca Beach on the New South Wales Central Coast about the ugly debate that has played out after Labor senator Kimberley Kitching\u2019s death. \u201cI will say this, the Labor family are mourning the passing of Kimberley Kitching,\u201d he says. \u201cAt age 52, it is far too young to lose a valued colleague. I will be there at her farewell on Monday. It will be a sad occasion. And everyone in Labor is mourning this loss.\u201d He addresses \u201csome of the criticism that is around\u201d: My colleagues in the Senate, senator Keneally, senator Wong and senator Gallagher, issued a media release yesterday addressing those issues, including senator Wong reiterating over a statement she made to senator Kitching, she apologised after that occurred and she believed that the apology was accepted. Politics can be a robust business, my politics is better for the participation of valued colleagues in leadership positions, including Penny, Katy and Kristina Keneally. Voting is under way in South Australia, with the Labor leader, Peter Malinauskas, and Liberal leader, Steven Marshall, casting their ballots. AAP reports: Opposition leader Peter Malinauskas thinks the South Australian election will be tight, but premier Steven Marshall has tipped a clear result as both leaders made a final pitch for votes. Malinauskas said Saturday\u2019s poll was a once in a lifetime opportunity for the state to rebuild after the Covid-19 global pandemic. He was out early on Saturday to cast his own ballot and greet voters at a school in his safe seat of Croydon. \u201cYou only get one chance to rebuild from the global pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cSouth Australia has a really clear choice today. A choice between a government that seems to be at war with itself or a fresh united team with a clear vision for the future of our state.\u201d Despite recent opinion polls putting Labor in a commanding position, Malinauskas said he expected the result to be close. The premier voted mid-morning in his eastern suburbs seat of Dunstan and said the poll was about who people trusted to give them certainty. \u201cI\u2019m very confident that the people of South Australia will vote in their own interests and have a continuing Liberal government,\u201d he said. Marshall said he wasn\u2019t concerned about opinion polls and expected to have a clear indication of the result before the night was out. \u201cSome people in polling will send a message to a political party but when they get in that booth they vote in what\u2019s in their best interests and what\u2019s in their families\u2019 best interests,\u201d he said. Today in history: the Sydney Harbour Bridge opened to the public 90 years ago. Taking nine years to construct, the bridge\u2019s much anticipated opening was controversially upstaged by a member of the fascist New Guard group, who rode a borrowed horse out of the crowd and slashed the ceremonial ribbon before New South Wales premier Jack Lang could do so.

A man has been charged with murder after an alleged intruder was fatally shot at a home near Katherine in the Northern Territory. AAP reports: The 38-year-old resident of the home was taken into custody soon after a 26-year-old man was shot dead on Thursday morning, 350km south of Darwin. Officers found the dead man\u2019s body about 4am after a caller reported that a male intruder was inside the home. Detective Senior Sergeant Jakson Evans previously told reporters that it was a confronting scene. A woman and two children were also in the home during the incident. The man charged has been remanded in custody to appear before Katherine Local Court at a date to be set. The South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, has been speaking in South Australia on polling day. He says he is \u201cnot that fussed\u201d by polls predicting a Labor win. \u201cLast [federal] election they said Bill Shorten was definitely going to be the prime minister of Australia, it didn\u2019t work out that way\u201dhe says. He says he expects South Australians will vote in their best interests. \u201cI put my future in the hands of the people of South Australia, we\u2019ve delivered for them in the first four years and we\u2019ve got great opportunities for the second four years.\u201d He says he thinks his government have been able to demonstrate over the past four years that they have worked in the best interests of South Australians. Via AAP: Travel agents hit hard by Covid restrictions will be given more than $75m in government support to help recover. In the wake of state and international borders reopening, a new program will offer targeted assistance to agents and tour arrangement service providers. The funds will be directed towards helping travellers rebook trips using existing Covid-related credits. Tourism minister Dan Tehan says the $75.5 m package will boost the industry\u2019s bid to rebound from the downturns triggered by the pandemic. \u201cAustralia\u2019s tourism industry is bouncing back, with international and state borders now open and a date set for the resumption of cruising,\u201d he said. \u201cConfidence is growing, Australians are booking holidays with their travel credits and our travel agents are in demand.\u201d Australian Federation of Travel Agents chief executive Dean Long says it\u2019s critically important the money is distributed quickly to eligible businesses and he believes a revised eligibility framework will facilitate that. A man has been pulled from a burning ute in Alice Springs after he suffered a medical episode on his way to work and ran off the road, AAP reports. Two police officers were among the first to arrive at the scene where they found a fire in the engine growing bigger by the second, a Northern Territory police spokeswoman says. \u201cI could not get to the driver\u2019s side door,\u201d one of the officers recalled after rescuing the man on Friday morning. \u201cI went to the passenger door, but I could only partially open it because of the angle of the car. \u201cTwo guys helped by ripping the door open.\u201d The officer then pulled the semi-conscious driver, 53, out of the burning ute and with the help of the other officer and a passer-by, carried him to safety. Paramedics later took the man to the Alice Springs Hospital, where he remains in a stable condition. NSW Health says the 12 people announced as having died with Covid were seven men and five women. Two people were aged in their 50s, three people were aged in their 70s, four people were aged in their 80s and three people were aged in their 90s. Of the 10 people who died over the age of 65, three people had received three doses of a Covid vaccine, three people had received two doses and four were not vaccinated. The two men in their 50s who died were both unvaccinated and had significant underlying health conditions. This brings the total number of Covid-19 related deaths in NSW since the beginning of the pandemic to 2,019. There are currently 1,090 people in NSW hospitals due to Covid-19, 29 are in intensive care, 13 of whom require ventilation. The NSW transport and veterans minister, David Elliott, says the 90th birthday of the Sydney Harbour Bridge is more than a landmark birthday. \u201cOn this day 90 years ago, the Sydney Harbour Bridge came to life, and so too did the vision of a modern Sydney. \u201cMore than one million people crossed the bridge on its opening day in trams, trains and on foot, which was almost the entire population of Sydney at that time.\u201d The minister for metropolitan roads, Natalie Ward, said that before the bridge linked two sides of the harbour, Sydney was a tale of two cities. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine life in Sydney without this vital transport link. The bridge has been a constant beacon of economic strength, not only connecting our harbour but showcasing Sydney to the world.\u201d Herald Sun sport reporter Michael Warner has been awarded the top honour at the Melbourne Press Club awards for his scoop on a report that found \u201csystemic racism\u201d at Collingwood football club, which prompted the resignation of club president Eddie McGuire. Guardian Australia also received two awards after five nominations. Guardian Australia\u2019s inequality editor, Luke Henriques-Gomes, won the quill for reporting on disability affairs for his work reporting on the National Disability Insurance Commission. Matilda Boseley was awarded the quill for innovation in journalism for reports she wrote, filmed, starred in and produced for Guardian Australia\u2019s Tiktok account. Opposition leader Peter Malinauskas has pitched the South Australian election as a once in a lifetime opportunity for the state to rebuild after the Covid global pandemic, AAP reports. Mr Malinauskas was out early on Saturday to cast his own ballot and greet voters at a school in his safe seat of Croydon. \u201cYou only get one chance to rebuild from the global pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cSouth Australia has a really clear choice today. A choice between a government that seems to be at war with itself or a fresh united team with a clear vision for the future of our state.\u201d Despite recent opinion polls putting Labor in a commanding position, Mr Malinauskas said he expected the result to be close. Labor has focused heavily on health throughout the campaign, promising to spend big to fix an ailing system plagued by ambulance ramping and overloaded hospitals. But that has allowed Premier Steven Marshall to mount a sustained attack on the opposition\u2019s big spending promises, warning of higher taxes and charges. The premier will vote in his eastern suburbs seat of Dunstan on Saturday and said the poll was about who South Australians trusted to give them certainty. \u201cChanging the government now risks our economic recovery and will cost us time and money,\u201d he said. And in another feature worth your time today, Paddy Manning has written about how the fight to save Lake Pedder in Tasmania 50 years ago led to the world\u2019s first green party. Fifty years ago, at a rowdy meeting at the Hobart town hall, the world\u2019s first \u201cgreen\u201d party was formed. While the word Green was not officially used, and it would take some time for the United Tasmania Group to be formally registered as a political party, it was the beginning of an organised effort to use the political system to push for a spotlight on environmental issues. The building of the Sydney Harbour Bridge was a powerful symbol of where Australia thought it was going \u2013 and who it was leaving behind Paul Daley has written an excellent piece marking the 90th anniversary of the unveiling of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. You can read the feature here: As South Australians head to the polls today, my colleague Tory Shepherd writes that the state election is attracting more interest around the country than usual in the lead-up to the May federal election. While Labor has been ahead in the polls, Haydon Manning, an adjunct associate professor in politics, policy and global affairs at Flinders University, says the outcome of this state election is unusually hard to predict. You can read the full story here: Josh Frydenberg has flagged he is \u201copen\u201d to further market interventions making insurance more affordable, but says more preparatory work will need to be done before the Morrison government would extend its $10bn cyclone reinsurance pool in northern Australia to cover more natural disasters. In an interview with Guardian Australia ahead of the budget on 29 March, the treasurer said he was conscious that a changing climate rendered insurance problematic in some parts of Australia. You can read the full story by Katharine Murphy here: The sole carer of a woman has been charged with murder after her emaciated body was found in Sydney\u2019s south-west, police say. Officers arrived at an address in Greenacre and arrested an 82-year-old man, taking him to Bankstown police station where they charged him with murder. Read more here: Victoria has also reported its Covid-19 numbers. Two people have died and 210 are in hospital, including 23 in intensive care. There were 7,847 new cases. There have been 12 Covid-related deaths in NSW in the past 24 hours. The state has recorded 19,060 new cases and there are 1,090 people in hospital, including 29 in intensive care. Close to 1 million South Australians are set to cast their votes in a state election that will either return Liberal premier Steven Marshall for a second term or install Labor\u2019s Peter Malinauskas as SA\u2019s next leader, AAP reports. More than 1.2 million people have registered to vote, but around 300,000 have cast an early ballot or applied for a postal vote. They could be crucial to the outcome along with six independents who could help one of the major parties form government if the result is a hung parliament. Recent opinion polls have Labor in a commanding position and while the opposition needs just a two per cent swing to pick up the necessary five seats, it remains unclear if the swing will come in the right places, a string of marginal seats held by the government. Mr Malinauskas has focused heavily on health throughout the election campaign, promising to spend big to fix an ailing system plagued by ambulance ramping and overloaded hospitals. But that has allowed Mr Marshall to mount a sustained attack on Labor\u2019s big spending promises, warning of higher taxes and charges if the opposition wins. If the government falls, it will be the first in Australia to suffer such a fate during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cIt feels more than uncomfortable to be writing a column about a woman who died suddenly just over a week ago at the age of 52,\u201d writes my colleague Katharine Murphy in her column today about the ugly debate that has played out after the death of Labor senator Kimberley Kitching. \u201cUncomfortable because the Labor senator Kimberley Kitching is no longer here to exercise the judgments that inevitably shape how, when and on what terms her story is told. Other players featuring in the reported cameos of Kitching\u2019s last months in public life also feel constrained in how they respond, either out of self-preservation, or because contesting the recollections and confidences of a recently deceased woman feels unseemly.\u201d You can read the whole piece here: Good morning everyone, Lisa Cox with you and I\u2019ll be taking you through the day. South Australians are set to vote in the state election today, which will decide the fate of the Liberal government led by the premier, Steven Marshall. Recent opinion polls have Labor under opposition leader Peter Malinauskas in a commanding position. While the opposition needs just a 2% swing to pick up the necessary five seats, it remains unclear if the swing will come in the right places, a string of marginal seats held by the government. On Friday there were 11 more Covid-related deaths in Queensland, nine in Victoria and six in NSW. There were 48,799 new cases nationwide, with the most in NSW, which reported 20,050 new infections. Yesterday New South Wales reported one more case of Japanese encephalitis, taking the state\u2019s case numbers to eight, while South Australian cases of Japanese encephalitis also rose to eight. We will also be keeping our eyes on the fallout from the ugly public debate playing out after the death of Victorian senator Kimberley Kitching last week. Yesterday senior Labor politicians Penny Wong, Kristina Keneally and Katy Gallagher denied allegations they contributed to \u201cbullying\u201d against Kitching, calling the claims \u201cuntrue\u201d and \u201churtful\u201d. Late yesterday an inquest into the death of Kumanjayi Walker was announced. The suppression orders in relation to the Zachary Rolfe trial were also lifted. In lighter news, Sydney is celebrating the 90th anniversary of the unveiling of the Harbour Bridge. Let\u2019s jump in.",

Jurors, they have said, would see social media posts and hear secretly recorded conversations, highly inflammatory language and details of a plan to take down a \u201ctyrant\u201d.</p> <p>When they were arrested the case seemed a slam dunk. But as more evidence has unfolded and the trial has begun, a different narrative has emerged. Far from being a dedicated bunch of coup-plotters, their attorneys argue, the Wolverine Watchmen are hapless victims of FBI entrapment who had been induced by paid informants to commit crimes they would not otherwise have considered.</p> <p>The FBI, according to defense filings, deployed at least 12 informants, as well as several undercover agents. \u201cThere was no plan, there was no agreement and no kidnapping,\u201d defense attorney Joshua Blanchard said last week.</p> <p>It is not an entirely outlandish claim. The defense\u2019s argument of FBI entrapment draws on a long history. In the post 9/11 era, when internal US security agencies focused on the existence of Muslim extremist plots, several prosecutions, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/12/newburgh-four-fbi-entrapment-terror\">including of the Newburgh Four,</a> hinged on informants actively promoting a plot before turning would-be perpetrators over to the government to be tried on conspiracy charges.</p> <p>Activists and civil rights experts have argued that the FBI has frequently overstepped boundaries, essentially egging on people to participate in plots and locking up people for crimes that they would never have committed had it not been for the intervention of law enforcement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fa73bed6ef5be8f4dd7ced6510e1aeb35f6a1738\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa73bed6ef5be8f4dd7ced6510e1aeb35f6a1738/0_0_9694_2968/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The accused, from left: Barry Croft, Daniel Harris, Adam Fox and Brandon Caserta.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The accused, from left: Barry Croft, Daniel Harris, Adam Fox and Brandon Caserta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those counter-terrorist techniques, reapplied to the threat of white nationalist radicalization that Joe Biden has repeatedly said is the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/jun/01/joe-biden-tulsa-oklahoma-race-massacre-us-politics-live\">most lethal threat</a>\u201d to the US, will play a part in how the Wolverine Watchmen trial unfolds. It has raised the question: were the Wolverines more dupes than dedicated terrorists?</p> <p>\u201cCounter-terrorism tactics have evolved because there wasn\u2019t a lot of international terrorism occurring on the US soil,\u201d said Mike German, author of Disrupt, Discredit and Divide: How the FBI Damages Democracy. \u201cBut there\u2019s still pressure to make cases and that\u2019s caused the FBI to adopt this methodology of manufacturing terrorism plots.\u201d</p> <p>German, who served 16 years as an FBI special agent and is now attached to the Brennan Center for Justice and NYU law school, says the tactics have migrated to far-right groups, though not necessarily with much success. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/04/usa-extremists-tea-party-republicans\">Hutaree militia case</a> of 2010, in which nine members of a Michigan group infiltrated by the FBI were accused of plotting to kill a police officer, ended in acquittal.</p> <p>\u201cWhen these tactics first started it was easy to get the public on the FBI\u2019s side just by making allegations,\u201d German said, recalling the case of the Liberty City Seven \u2013 a Muslim extremist plot to blow up Chicago\u2019s Sears Tower that ended, after three trials, in five convictions.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is, they\u2019re manufacturing crimes and that\u2019s not the job of a law enforcement agency \u2013 to make themselves look good by solving crimes they create \u2013 and there\u2019s no legitimate government purpose in manufacturing a plot,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Another issue, German says, is that there\u2019s more white supremacist/far-right activity in the US than there ever was Muslim extremism. But the federal government doesn\u2019t maintain a database on white extremist violence, lumping all extremism \u2013 white nationalist, environmentalist \u2013 in one category under the<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/101st-congress/house-bill/1048\"> Hate Crimes Statistics Act</a> (1990) and the<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/National-Strategy-for-Countering-Domestic-Terrorism.pdf\"> National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism</a>, announced last year.</p> <p>And that, German points out, has left the government without accurate data on what has occurred and in a position of trying to predict and prevent what <em>might</em> occur. \u201cThe issue is starting with talk and getting to violence, but not vice versa,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d826c5618635f62e85916fb2e8c62a901e39a14b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d826c5618635f62e85916fb2e8c62a901e39a14b/0_156_4605_2764/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Men carry rifles near the steps of the state capitol building in Lansing, Michigan, in April 2020 during a protest over Governor Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s orders to keep people at home and businesses locked during the coronavirus outbreak.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Men carry rifles near the steps of the state capitol building in Lansing, Michigan, in April 2020 during a protest over Governor Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s orders to keep people at home and businesses locked during the coronavirus outbreak.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Sancya/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the Wolverine Watchmen case, the four defendants are accused of taking deliberate steps toward violence, including secret messaging, gun drills and a night drive to northern Michigan to scout Whitmer\u2019s vacation house. Two of the six men initially arrested, Ty Garbin and Kaleb Franks, have pleaded guilty and will appear as government witnesses.</p> <p>But defense attorneys claim that one of the men on trial, Barry Croft, was lured to militia meetings and gun training by \u201cBig Dan\u201d, an informant with a long criminal history who was paid $54,000 by the FBI.</p> <p>Big Dan\u2019s handler was Jayson Chambers, an FBI agent who was looking to build a security consulting business that included \u201conline undercover techniques\u201d and had participated in investigations of Muslim \u201cplots\u201d involving inducements.</p> <p>Another informant, Stephen Robeson, has pleaded to various felonies. Another government witness, FBI agent Robert Trask, was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/24/us/whitmer-kidnapping-trial.html\">fired</a> after beating his wife after a swingers party. Another was <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21155559-caserta-response-to-reply-to-motion-826\">accused</a> of perjury.</p> <p>Still, anti-government extremism in the upper midwest comes with a track record that includes Terry Nichols, a participant in the 1995 Oklahoma city bombing, who was from Michigan.

      "bodyText": "Four members of the Wolverine Watchmen, a Michigan group that the government accuses of plotting to kidnap and kill Governor Gretchen Whitmer, are \u2013 depending on whom you believe \u2013 members of a dangerous paramilitary or a group of big-talking good ole boys full of hot air. Adam Fox, Brandon Caserta, Barry Croft Jr and Daniel Harris were charged in October 2020 with conspiring to abduct Whitmer from her northern Michigan vacation house. Their motive, say prosecutors in Grand Rapids, was anger over the Democrat\u2019s Covid-19 restrictions and their plan has become a symbol of rising far-right violence and the threat it represents to US democracy. At the moment the FBI arrested the men, prosecutors argued in court, they had plans to acquire a bomb to blow up a bridge near Whitmer\u2019s home to hinder police. Jurors, they have said, would see social media posts and hear secretly recorded conversations, highly inflammatory language and details of a plan to take down a \u201ctyrant\u201d. When they were arrested the case seemed a slam dunk. But as more evidence has unfolded and the trial has begun, a different narrative has emerged. Far from being a dedicated bunch of coup-plotters, their attorneys argue, the Wolverine Watchmen are hapless victims of FBI entrapment who had been induced by paid informants to commit crimes they would not otherwise have considered. The FBI, according to defense filings, deployed at least 12 informants, as well as several undercover agents. \u201cThere was no plan, there was no agreement and no kidnapping,\u201d defense attorney Joshua Blanchard said last week. It is not an entirely outlandish claim. The defense\u2019s argument of FBI entrapment draws on a long history. In the post 9/11 era, when internal US security agencies focused on the existence of Muslim extremist plots, several prosecutions, including of the Newburgh Four, hinged on informants actively promoting a plot before turning would-be perpetrators over to the government to be tried on conspiracy charges. Activists and civil rights experts have argued that the FBI has frequently overstepped boundaries, essentially egging on people to participate in plots and locking up people for crimes that they would never have committed had it not been for the intervention of law enforcement. Those counter-terrorist techniques, reapplied to the threat of white nationalist radicalization that Joe Biden has repeatedly said is the \u201cmost lethal threat\u201d to the US, will play a part in how the Wolverine Watchmen trial unfolds. It has raised the question: were the Wolverines more dupes than dedicated terrorists? \u201cCounter-terrorism tactics have evolved because there wasn\u2019t a lot of international terrorism occurring on the US soil,\u201d said Mike German, author of Disrupt, Discredit and Divide: How the FBI Damages Democracy. \u201cBut there\u2019s still pressure to make cases and that\u2019s caused the FBI to adopt this methodology of manufacturing terrorism plots.\u201d German, who served 16 years as an FBI special agent and is now attached to the Brennan Center for Justice and NYU law school, says the tactics have migrated to far-right groups, though not necessarily with much success. The Hutaree militia case of 2010, in which nine members of a Michigan group infiltrated by the FBI were accused of plotting to kill a police officer, ended in acquittal. \u201cWhen these tactics first started it was easy to get the public on the FBI\u2019s side just by making allegations,\u201d German said, recalling the case of the Liberty City Seven \u2013 a Muslim extremist plot to blow up Chicago\u2019s Sears Tower that ended, after three trials, in five convictions. \u201cThe problem is, they\u2019re manufacturing crimes and that\u2019s not the job of a law enforcement agency \u2013 to make themselves look good by solving crimes they create \u2013 and there\u2019s no legitimate government purpose in manufacturing a plot,\u201d he said. Another issue, German says, is that there\u2019s more white supremacist/far-right activity in the US than there ever was Muslim extremism. But the federal government doesn\u2019t maintain a database on white extremist violence, lumping all extremism \u2013 white nationalist, environmentalist \u2013 in one category under the Hate Crimes Statistics Act (1990) and the National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism, announced last year. And that, German points out, has left the government without accurate data on what has occurred and in a position of trying to predict and prevent what might occur. \u201cThe issue is starting with talk and getting to violence, but not vice versa,\u201d he said. In the Wolverine Watchmen case, the four defendants are accused of taking deliberate steps toward violence, including secret messaging, gun drills and a night drive to northern Michigan to scout Whitmer\u2019s vacation house. Two of the six men initially arrested, Ty Garbin and Kaleb Franks, have pleaded guilty and will appear as government witnesses. But defense attorneys claim that one of the men on trial, Barry Croft, was lured to militia meetings and gun training by \u201cBig Dan\u201d, an informant with a long criminal history who was paid $54,000 by the FBI. Big Dan\u2019s handler was Jayson Chambers, an FBI agent who was looking to build a security consulting business that included \u201conline undercover techniques\u201d and had participated in investigations of Muslim \u201cplots\u201d involving inducements. Another informant, Stephen Robeson, has pleaded to various felonies. Another government witness, FBI agent Robert Trask, was fired after beating his wife after a swingers party. Another was accused of perjury. Still, anti-government extremism in the upper midwest comes with a track record that includes Terry Nichols, a participant in the 1995 Oklahoma city bombing, who was from Michigan. Fourteen men from the state have been charged in connection with the January 6 insurrection. In 2020, hundreds of protesters, some armed, some driving Humvees, attempted to enter the floor of the legislative chamber of Michigan\u2019s state capitol as lawmakers debated Whitmer\u2019s request to extend emergency Covid powers. Some compared Whitmer to Hitler. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised this is coming out of Michigan because of its history and because Governor Whitmer has drawn a lot of negative attention for her lockdown procedures,\u201d said Amy Cooter, a sociologist at Vanderbilt University and author of Problems Predicting Extremist Violence. Cooter suggests the alleged plot against Whitmer was not merely about Covid restrictions but also because she is a woman and a Democrat. In Cooter\u2019s experience groups that indulge in extremist talk rarely translate that into action. \u201cThe problem is there\u2019s always potential for it to evolve into something more,\u201d Cooter adds. \u201cSo when a specific person is targeted I think we have to take it seriously.\u201d Nils Kessler, the assistant US attorney prosecuting the current case, has drawn explicit parallels between the plan and the January 6 attack. \u201cAs the Capitol riots demonstrated, an inchoate conspiracy can turn into a grave substantive offense on short notice,\u201d he wrote in a court filing. Whatever the jury\u2019s findings in the Wolverine case, Cooter predicts, groups on the right are \u201cgoing to assume they were set up and [it] could galvanize some to further action\u201d. JoEllen Vinyard, a professor of history at Eastern Michigan University who notes that today\u2019s white nationalists have antecedents in racist groups like the KKK, says groups like the Wolverine Watchmen \u201csee themselves as standing for democracy and in many cases saving the country from its leaders\u201d. Michigan, she said, gets a lot of attention because groups there appear to be periodically better organized, depending on their leadership. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know the role of the FBI in this but these particular guys don\u2019t seem to be the type that could exert much leadership,\u201d she said. She added: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of unrest in this country that we haven\u2019t always recognized, and people have different reasons at different times.

Aboah was deemed \u201cunconventionally beautiful\u201d by many in the media, perhaps a subtle way of saying that she did not fit Eurocentric beauty standards; for many more, she was the representation they had been yearning for.</p> <p>However, there were several years when it felt as if her career had stalled. \u201cIt\u2019s a weird one,\u201d Aboah says, dialling in as she hotfoots it from central London to the airport, a place where she spends much of her time (she is based between the UK and LA). \u201cWith the conversations that we\u2019ve had since around race and diversity, we understand what was going on. But back then, I was like: \u2018I don\u2019t get it.\u2019 I started at the same time as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/cara-delevingne\" title=\"\">Cara [Delevingne]</a>, maybe a little after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/nov/23/edie-campbell-i-was-fuming-to-be-told-i-was-too-fat-to-open-milan-fashion-week\" title=\"\">Edie [Campbell]</a>, but I hadn\u2019t really been given my moment.

Even so, she remains instantly recognisable, as much for her face \u2013 flanked by ears adorned from top to bottom with gold rings and precious trinkets \u2013 as her west London drawl. The daughter of Camilla Lowther, a British model turned influential talent agency boss, and Charles Aboah, who is from Ghana, once described as London\u2019s go-to location scout for editorial shoots, Aboah grew up in Notting Hill, immersed in the fashion business. Her younger sister, Kesewa, is an artist. Much has been written about her family\u2019s privilege (in a recent interview, the Lowthers\u2019 ancestral home was brought up, to which Aboah, seemingly wearily, replied she would \u201chave to look that up\u201d). She was educated at Millfield school in Somerset, where current annual fees for boarding stand at around \u00a340,000, and she has spoken frequently about her difficulties there \u2013 relaxing her hair to fit in with the white, straight-haired masses, but ending up with something that resembled, in her words, \u201cthe end of a broom\u201d. She began using drugs heavily as a teen, and today she describes it as a \u201cdeeply unhappy\u201d period.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"74e9208af918704fe993a87888638bc0ce861691\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74e9208af918704fe993a87888638bc0ce861691/0_0_2563_3366/761.jpg\" alt=\"Adwoa Aboah on Edward Enninful\u2019s first Vogue cover, wearing blue eyeshadow and with her hair in a turban\" width=\"761\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On Edward Enninful\u2019s first Vogue cover.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steven Meisel/Vogue</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On graduating from Brunel University in 2013, she co-founded a casting agency, AAM\u00d8, before moving into modelling. But despite her connections, doors remained closed to her, and repeated rejections hit her hard. \u201cI think I went into it with a rose-tinted idea of what it could be,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause of my mum being in the fashion industry, and because I knew everyone, people probably assumed that I was going to get these big jobs. But the industry was so different then.\u201d Besides, she says, she didn\u2019t feel as if she had much support: \u201cOne would hope that you were in a team where they <em>really</em> believed in you.\u201d \u2013 In 2015, she departed Storm for Tess Management.</p> <p>While her recent bedroom<strong> </strong>clearout was difficult, reminding her of the rejections of her early career, Aboah says it was also \u201cenlightening\u201d, emphasising for her just how far fashion has come in a short space of time, in terms of embracing diversity. Of course, British Vogue is just one part of that world, but it is a big part \u2013 the aspirational \u201cstyle bible\u201d that, for generations, drip-fed teens like the young Aboah with images of mostly white, often stick-thin models and impossibly expensive clothes. When she left the magazine in 2017, former editor Alexandra Shulman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/nov/10/former-vogue-editor-alexandra-shulman-find-idea-that-there-was-a-posh-cabal-offensive\" title=\"\">told the Guardian</a> that she had offered Aboah a Vogue cover but Aboah had turned her down. Shulman also wondered if Aboah \u201cmaybe \u2026 knew she was going to get [Enninful\u2019s first] cover.\u201d </p> <p>I ask Aboah whether she remembers it that way. She \u201chmms\u201d for a second, before saying that she \u201cdidn\u2019t pay much attention\u201d to Shulman\u2019s comments. \u201cSomeone sent me the piece. She said something like I was the best kind of Black girl \u2026 I can\u2019t even remember how she worded it, it was something quite weird. [Shulman called her \u201cthe perfect mixture of mixed race, sort of posh Notting Hill royalty \u2026 the perfect cover star.\u201d] Absolutely no shade to her as an editor, but [Enninful\u2019s cover] made sense. It felt like a new beginning. I wanted to be part of that.\u201d Over email, Enninful \u2013 a friend of Aboah\u2019s \u2013 has only the highest praise for her, telling me he wanted to \u201chighlight the best of Britain, in all of its unique, diverse and multitalented glory. Adwoa represented all of those facets for me \u2026 to see this Black British woman leading the way in my industry while also drawing attention to important social issues was really inspiring.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes my behaviour is so toxic on social media. The way I\u2019m comparing myself with other people isn\u2019t healthy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The cover came after a new beginning for Aboah herself. After spells in rehab and, in 2014, a suicide attempt that left her in a coma for four days, she took time out of the industry, getting treatment for the depression and addiction problems that had lingered since her teens. (In a 2017 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdXkEurbMv4\" title=\"\">video interview</a> with her mother, Camilla, Aboah describes not feeling able to share her depression with her family; Camilla admits that the family were \u201call in denial \u2026 until you tried to kill yourself\u201d). Recovery and getting sober led her to work with nonprofit organisations, before founding her own in 2015.</p> <p>\u201cPeople think Gurls Talk came later, when my career took off, but it was definitely birthed from the rock bottom that I\u2019d been at, and the support that I\u2019d been given,\u201d Aboah says. \u201cI\u2019d been given tools for how to be honest for the first time. I was looking at things I\u2019d been too scared to look at.\u201d Alongside global events that, pre-pandemic, took place everywhere from Italy to Ghana, Gurls Talk now produces a podcast in which Aboah has \u201cfierce female chat\u201d and candid conversations about mental health and wellbeing (guests have included novelists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/sep/25/bernardine-evaristo-on-a-childhood-shaped-by-racism-i-was-never-going-to-give-up\" title=\"\">Bernardine Evaristo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jul/16/lisa-taddeo-i-suppose-it-comes-as-no-surprise-that-i-like-dark-writing\" title=\"\">Lisa Taddeo</a>; activists Soma Sara and Janaya Future Khan; and fellow model <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/nov/13/crooks-creeps-and-indecent-proposals-emily-ratajkowski-on-being-paid-to-hang-out-with-rich-men\" title=\"\">Emily Ratajkoswki</a>).

Aboah says it\u2019s \u201cterrifying\u201d, and we talk briefly about teens, online bullying, and the reactive nature of social media where \u201cpeople word-vomit things they might regret\u201d, before she admits that these things consume her, too. \u201cI\u2019m turning 30 this year, and I don\u2019t know about you, but sometimes \u2026 I mean \u2013 my behaviour is so toxic on social media. I have to take a backseat and be like: \u2018The way I\u2019m comparing myself with other people isn\u2019t healthy.\u2019 It can be the weirdest things \u2026 suddenly you\u2019re worrying about the fact that \u2013 obviously I\u2019m being silly here \u2013 your ears aren\u2019t small enough. Even now, during London Fashion Week, it\u2019s like: \u2018I\u2019m not doing the shows; I should be doing the shows.\u2019 It\u2019s like, \u2018No, you\u2019re doing something amazing, you\u2019re getting this moment to be in this TV show.\u2019 We put so much pressure on ourselves. So I can\u2019t even imagine what it must be like, growing up now. It\u2019s very obvious with the information out there that no young girl should be on social media.\u201d As for her own social media posts, they lean more towards the artfully detached and carefree \u2013 sure, there are glossy magazine shoots on her Instagram grid, but there are also snaps of her wearing Minnie Mouse ears at Disneyland and, recently, a phallic cactus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b17be5e9e26289c67632a0f83effd80dbfa1f1e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b17be5e9e26289c67632a0f83effd80dbfa1f1e0/0_0_4197_4957/847.jpg\" alt=\"Adwoa Aboah wears pink, one-shoulder dress by Allbright and a starfish earring by Aralda.\" width=\"847\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dress by Allbright.

Everyone had so much to say, and everyone was going through such personal experiences, growth and sadness.\u201d It also led to a <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/news/article/september-2020-issue-editors-letter\" title=\"\">second Vogue cover</a>, this time alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/marcus-rashford\" title=\"\">Marcus Rashford</a>, shot in the footballer\u2019s garden in Manchester, for an issue spotlighting \u201cfaces of hope\u201d. It was a huge moment \u2013 and one she almost turned down. At the time, Aboah says, she \u201cdidn\u2019t think it was my place to be that person. I think it\u2019s because I hadn\u2019t really delved into race and my feelings around it, and what I had been through. My mum\u2019s white, my dad\u2019s Black, and there had been a lot of confusion personally as to how I felt about it all. And, actually, it was great.\u201d There\u2019s a sense of gratitude in her voice as she describes \u201cchampioning the Black community \u2026 I\u2019m really happy that I did take that opportunity, because I am very much part of that community. I am a Black woman. I have a lot of things to say, which I hadn\u2019t had the confidence to speak about.\u201d</p> <p>Suddenly, Aboah felt she could make her voice heard. \u201cWhen people said, \u2018It\u2019s not as bad here in the UK,\u2019 others were standing up and saying, \u2018It is. There aren\u2019t guns, we aren\u2019t being shot at, but it\u2019s definitely here.\u2019\u201d Even so, there was discomfort mixed in with the epiphanies. She had, she says, \u201ca full-on identity crisis. It was a mad time, and we were all having to look at ourselves. Within the realm of fashion, for example, I had this new confidence. I was like: \u2018I\u2019m not going to tolerate someone doing my hair again who doesn\u2019t understand Black hair.\u2019 Not because I\u2019m a diva, but because it\u2019s not right.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94952d34ff05733daa053853592e8ae0b7810cbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94952d34ff05733daa053853592e8ae0b7810cbd/0_0_4203_4964/847.jpg\" alt=\"A portrait of Adwoa Aboah smiling, with her arms folded over her head\" width=\"847\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clothes by Dior.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Jackson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aboah had another realisation over lockdown, when she decided that if she wanted to become an actor, it was now or never (she previously had a bit part in the 2017 big-screen anime adaptation Ghost in the Shell, with Scarlett Johansson). Her voice fizzes with excitement at the mention of Top Boy, the east London-set drama that was resurrected by Netflix in 2019, six years after being cancelled by Channel 4. Executive produced by Canadian rapper Drake, the reboot upped the budget, chucking in a who\u2019s who of UK musicians including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/dave\" title=\"\">Dave</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/little-simz\" title=\"\">Little Simz</a>, as well as bringing back original cast members such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/jan/31/ashley-walters-kids-make-mistakes-i-know-that-now-as-a-father-of-eight\" title=\"\">Ashley Walters</a> and Kano. The latest series ups the production sheen even further, with diversions into the drug trade in Spain and Morocco straight out of Narcos. \u201cIt\u2019s mad, to be quite honest,\u201d Aboah laughs. \u201cI cannot even begin to tell you how much I wanted this role. I definitely sit on the more obsessive side of things in terms of my character \u2013 I\u2019m obsessed with manifesting. I auditioned about three or four times and I was overwhelmed with how much I wanted it. It was so out of my comfort zone, and such a challenge.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve been around different types of people my whole life. I might have gone to private school, but I grew up in a multifaceted community</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Aboah is keen to stress that this is something she has wanted for a long time. \u201cAt school, I wasn\u2019t passing with straight As or anything like that,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I really leaned into my more creative side.\u201d While experiments with the guitar proved unfruitful, \u201ctheatre was my first love. I was shy and nervous at boarding school. I was away from home, and away from my family and friends. Another girl had seen me sitting by myself all the time \u2013 she was like, \u2018This girl is quite depressed.\u2019 So she asked me if I wanted to audition for the school play. We\u2019re still friends now.\u201d</p> <p>Aboah was part of the National Youth Theatre and did a degree in drama. Rather than being seduced by the bright lights of the modelling industry, it seems she just wasn\u2019t in the right headspace for acting. \u201cAfter university, I didn\u2019t really have a good head on my shoulders \u2013 my work ethic wasn\u2019t necessarily that great.\u201d She was, she says, \u201ca bit distracted \u2026 by partying and all sorts of things. But before Covid, I knew that I really wanted to give it a chance. I got an agent and started doing acting classes.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2c7c5747a45572d1def3471adec21f8ca7e1e299\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c7c5747a45572d1def3471adec21f8ca7e1e299/0_241_3328_4597/724.jpg\" alt=\"Aboah\u2019s sister, Kesewa, father, Charles Aboah, and mother, Camilla Lowther.\" width=\"724\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aboah\u2019s sister, Kesewa, father, Charles Aboah, and mother, Camilla Lowther.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty Images for Mattel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Top Boy, she plays Becks, a love interest for Jasmine Jobson\u2019s tough-as-nails gang member Jaq. It\u2019s not a big role, but it is a memorable one, as the decidedly middle-class addition to a show set in a working-class world. There\u2019s even a scene where another character ponders why Becks doesn\u2019t tap up the bank of mum and dad for a bigger flat. As someone in a heterosexual relationship, did the prospect of portraying a same-sex couple \u2013 and one that attracts negative attention in the series \u2013 faze her? \u201cI think the women\u2019s storylines stand alone, away from what\u2019s going on with the men,\u201d she says. \u201cYou really get to know these women. By no means do I think I understand homophobia, but I was able to talk to friends in the queer community and get an understanding of what they\u2019ve had to deal with. And going back to what we\u2019ve been speaking about, I understand discrimination. I hope that I\u2019ve been able to tell the story authentically.\u201d</p> <p>What has it been like to engage with a series based on a world so different from her own background? \u201cLondon is filled with so many different people,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say that we\u2019re all segregated, and none of us mix. But living in west London, I\u2019ve been around different types of people my whole entire life. I might have gone to private school, but I\u2019ve been brought up around a multifaceted community. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt intimidated by being from a different world.\u201d </p> <p>Aboah has to catch her flight, but before she logs off, she tells me that she is already \u201con cloud nine\u201d at the prospect of showing what she can do as an actor. A few days after we speak, she posts a childhood photo on Instagram \u2013 possibly one dug out in her bedroom clearout. Unlike most people\u2019s childhood snaps, it was published in the triannual fashion magazine Pop, and shot by the photographer Alice Hawkins. In it, Aboah is dressed smartly, a serious look on her face and her hair in braids, younger but in many ways identical. Alongside it runs the caption: \u201cBy popular demand. Shy and 12 years old \u2026 Haven\u2019t changed at all \u2026\u201d Aboah\u2019s life <em>has</em> changed since those days, and yet in many ways she\u2019s stayed the same, as the world has changed around her. The picture reminds me of something she told me about her dad: \u201cHe turned to me, years ago, and said: \u2018I was just waiting for you to realise what you are capable of achieving.\u2019\u201d Binning her old magazines might have been a wrench, but it reminded her that she was always on the right track. </p> <p><em>\u2022 The new season of</em> <em>Top Boy </em><em>is available now on Netflix. <br>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>. </em><em>In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

      "bodyText": "A few weeks ago, Adwoa Aboah experienced what she describes as \u201ca sombre moment\u201d. \u201cI was at my mum and dad\u2019s, clearing out my childhood room,\u201d she says, her voice a little shaky. \u201cI was going through all these old Vogues I had kept, and I was like \u2026 \u2018Why did I do that? What was I looking at \u2026 who was I looking at?\u2019 Because no one in these magazines looks like me.\u201d Despite signing with the giant modelling agency Storm at 16, Aboah\u2019s self-esteem as a teenager and into her 20s was, she says, \u201cso low. I was on this trajectory of really wanting to be someone else. I couldn\u2019t count on my hands any models who looked like me who were killing it. Obviously there was Jourdan Dunn, and Naomi Campbell, but \u2026 \u201d she pauses, sighs. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the emotional intelligence, nor the language, to articulate why I wasn\u2019t doing well, why I wasn\u2019t in the places that I thought should have been an option for me. Why wasn\u2019t I being supported by British publications? I was like: \u2018Is it me? What\u2019s wrong with me?\u2019 Not in a kind of self-pitying way but \u2026 I just didn\u2019t understand.\u201d Now 29, Aboah is one of Britain\u2019s most recognisable and successful models, as likely to be seen endorsing Dior or Burberry as H&amp;M or Gap. She was named model of the year by the British Fashion Council in 2017 and, in the same year, memorably featured on the cover of Edward Enninful\u2019s first issue of British Vogue, a vision of retro cool in a patterned headscarf and masses of blue eyeshadow. She\u2019s also an activist, having founded the organisation Gurls Talk \u2013 which educates young women on topics including feminism, race, sex and body image \u2013 in 2015, and now she has her first regular acting role in the new series of Netflix\u2019s Top Boy, one of the coolest shows on TV. It\u2019s hard to believe that Aboah ever felt like a misfit and, worse still, thought that it was somehow her fault. In fact, the Londoner always had the kind of star quality that marked her out as one to watch, if not by fashion\u2019s gatekeepers, then by those in the know. Her barefaced beauty \u2013 complete with a constellation of freckles \u2013 made her something of an It girl in the early 2010s (ie, the Daily Mail started publishing articles about her tattoos). That role grew when she shaved off her previously relaxed copper hair into a gamine buzzcut in 2015. Aboah was deemed \u201cunconventionally beautiful\u201d by many in the media, perhaps a subtle way of saying that she did not fit Eurocentric beauty standards; for many more, she was the representation they had been yearning for. However, there were several years when it felt as if her career had stalled. \u201cIt\u2019s a weird one,\u201d Aboah says, dialling in as she hotfoots it from central London to the airport, a place where she spends much of her time (she is based between the UK and LA). \u201cWith the conversations that we\u2019ve had since around race and diversity, we understand what was going on. But back then, I was like: \u2018I don\u2019t get it.\u2019 I started at the same time as Cara [Delevingne], maybe a little after Edie [Campbell], but I hadn\u2019t really been given my moment. With my British Vogue cover, my career kind of took off. But I\u2019d been modelling for a long time. I\u2019d been waiting in the hope of getting my chance.\u201d Today, Aboah\u2019s shaved head is gone, replaced by cornrows that cut across her scalp in entrancingly neat, diagonal lines. Even so, she remains instantly recognisable, as much for her face \u2013 flanked by ears adorned from top to bottom with gold rings and precious trinkets \u2013 as her west London drawl. The daughter of Camilla Lowther, a British model turned influential talent agency boss, and Charles Aboah, who is from Ghana, once described as London\u2019s go-to location scout for editorial shoots, Aboah grew up in Notting Hill, immersed in the fashion business. Her younger sister, Kesewa, is an artist. Much has been written about her family\u2019s privilege (in a recent interview, the Lowthers\u2019 ancestral home was brought up, to which Aboah, seemingly wearily, replied she would \u201chave to look that up\u201d). She was educated at Millfield school in Somerset, where current annual fees for boarding stand at around \u00a340,000, and she has spoken frequently about her difficulties there \u2013 relaxing her hair to fit in with the white, straight-haired masses, but ending up with something that resembled, in her words, \u201cthe end of a broom\u201d. She began using drugs heavily as a teen, and today she describes it as a \u201cdeeply unhappy\u201d period. On graduating from Brunel University in 2013, she co-founded a casting agency, AAM\u00d8, before moving into modelling. But despite her connections, doors remained closed to her, and repeated rejections hit her hard. \u201cI think I went into it with a rose-tinted idea of what it could be,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause of my mum being in the fashion industry, and because I knew everyone, people probably assumed that I was going to get these big jobs. But the industry was so different then.\u201d Besides, she says, she didn\u2019t feel as if she had much support: \u201cOne would hope that you were in a team where they really believed in you.\u201d \u2013 In 2015, she departed Storm for Tess Management. While her recent bedroom clearout was difficult, reminding her of the rejections of her early career, Aboah says it was also \u201cenlightening\u201d, emphasising for her just how far fashion has come in a short space of time, in terms of embracing diversity. Of course, British Vogue is just one part of that world, but it is a big part \u2013 the aspirational \u201cstyle bible\u201d that, for generations, drip-fed teens like the young Aboah with images of mostly white, often stick-thin models and impossibly expensive clothes. When she left the magazine in 2017, former editor Alexandra Shulman told the Guardian that she had offered Aboah a Vogue cover but Aboah had turned her down. Shulman also wondered if Aboah \u201cmaybe \u2026 knew she was going to get [Enninful\u2019s first] cover.\u201d I ask Aboah whether she remembers it that way. She \u201chmms\u201d for a second, before saying that she \u201cdidn\u2019t pay much attention\u201d to Shulman\u2019s comments. \u201cSomeone sent me the piece. She said something like I was the best kind of Black girl \u2026 I can\u2019t even remember how she worded it, it was something quite weird. [Shulman called her \u201cthe perfect mixture of mixed race, sort of posh Notting Hill royalty \u2026 the perfect cover star.\u201d] Absolutely no shade to her as an editor, but [Enninful\u2019s cover] made sense. It felt like a new beginning. I wanted to be part of that.\u201d Over email, Enninful \u2013 a friend of Aboah\u2019s \u2013 has only the highest praise for her, telling me he wanted to \u201chighlight the best of Britain, in all of its unique, diverse and multitalented glory. Adwoa represented all of those facets for me \u2026 to see this Black British woman leading the way in my industry while also drawing attention to important social issues was really inspiring.\u201d The cover came after a new beginning for Aboah herself. After spells in rehab and, in 2014, a suicide attempt that left her in a coma for four days, she took time out of the industry, getting treatment for the depression and addiction problems that had lingered since her teens. (In a 2017 video interview with her mother, Camilla, Aboah describes not feeling able to share her depression with her family; Camilla admits that the family were \u201call in denial \u2026 until you tried to kill yourself\u201d). Recovery and getting sober led her to work with nonprofit organisations, before founding her own in 2015. \u201cPeople think Gurls Talk came later, when my career took off, but it was definitely birthed from the rock bottom that I\u2019d been at, and the support that I\u2019d been given,\u201d Aboah says. \u201cI\u2019d been given tools for how to be honest for the first time. I was looking at things I\u2019d been too scared to look at.\u201d Alongside global events that, pre-pandemic, took place everywhere from Italy to Ghana, Gurls Talk now produces a podcast in which Aboah has \u201cfierce female chat\u201d and candid conversations about mental health and wellbeing (guests have included novelists Bernardine Evaristo and Lisa Taddeo; activists Soma Sara and Janaya Future Khan; and fellow model Emily Ratajkoswki). With Gurls Talk, she says she finally \u201cfound her purpose\u201d, converting her trauma into something meaningful. A few days before we speak, a new report says that girls\u2019 mental health in the UK is \u201con a precipice\u201d, with 11-year-old girls 30% more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression than boys. Aboah says it\u2019s \u201cterrifying\u201d, and we talk briefly about teens, online bullying, and the reactive nature of social media where \u201cpeople word-vomit things they might regret\u201d, before she admits that these things consume her, too. \u201cI\u2019m turning 30 this year, and I don\u2019t know about you, but sometimes \u2026 I mean \u2013 my behaviour is so toxic on social media. I have to take a backseat and be like: \u2018The way I\u2019m comparing myself with other people isn\u2019t healthy.\u2019 It can be the weirdest things \u2026 suddenly you\u2019re worrying about the fact that \u2013 obviously I\u2019m being silly here \u2013 your ears aren\u2019t small enough. Even now, during London Fashion Week, it\u2019s like: \u2018I\u2019m not doing the shows; I should be doing the shows.\u2019 It\u2019s like, \u2018No, you\u2019re doing something amazing, you\u2019re getting this moment to be in this TV show.\u2019 We put so much pressure on ourselves. So I can\u2019t even imagine what it must be like, growing up now. It\u2019s very obvious with the information out there that no young girl should be on social media.\u201d As for her own social media posts, they lean more towards the artfully detached and carefree \u2013 sure, there are glossy magazine shoots on her Instagram grid, but there are also snaps of her wearing Minnie Mouse ears at Disneyland and, recently, a phallic cactus. After the murder of George Floyd, and a renewed energy around the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020, Aboah found her conversations on her Gurls Talk podcast getting \u201ca lot deeper. Everyone had so much to say, and everyone was going through such personal experiences, growth and sadness.\u201d It also led to a second Vogue cover, this time alongside Marcus Rashford, shot in the footballer\u2019s garden in Manchester, for an issue spotlighting \u201cfaces of hope\u201d. It was a huge moment \u2013 and one she almost turned down. At the time, Aboah says, she \u201cdidn\u2019t think it was my place to be that person. I think it\u2019s because I hadn\u2019t really delved into race and my feelings around it, and what I had been through. My mum\u2019s white, my dad\u2019s Black, and there had been a lot of confusion personally as to how I felt about it all. And, actually, it was great.\u201d There\u2019s a sense of gratitude in her voice as she describes \u201cchampioning the Black community \u2026 I\u2019m really happy that I did take that opportunity, because I am very much part of that community. I am a Black woman. I have a lot of things to say, which I hadn\u2019t had the confidence to speak about.\u201d Suddenly, Aboah felt she could make her voice heard. \u201cWhen people said, \u2018It\u2019s not as bad here in the UK,\u2019 others were standing up and saying, \u2018It is. There aren\u2019t guns, we aren\u2019t being shot at, but it\u2019s definitely here.\u2019\u201d Even so, there was discomfort mixed in with the epiphanies. She had, she says, \u201ca full-on identity crisis. It was a mad time, and we were all having to look at ourselves. Within the realm of fashion, for example, I had this new confidence. I was like: \u2018I\u2019m not going to tolerate someone doing my hair again who doesn\u2019t understand Black hair.\u2019 Not because I\u2019m a diva, but because it\u2019s not right.\u201d Aboah had another realisation over lockdown, when she decided that if she wanted to become an actor, it was now or never (she previously had a bit part in the 2017 big-screen anime adaptation Ghost in the Shell, with Scarlett Johansson). Her voice fizzes with excitement at the mention of Top Boy, the east London-set drama that was resurrected by Netflix in 2019, six years after being cancelled by Channel 4. Executive produced by Canadian rapper Drake, the reboot upped the budget, chucking in a who\u2019s who of UK musicians including Dave and Little Simz, as well as bringing back original cast members such as Ashley Walters and Kano. The latest series ups the production sheen even further, with diversions into the drug trade in Spain and Morocco straight out of Narcos. \u201cIt\u2019s mad, to be quite honest,\u201d Aboah laughs. \u201cI cannot even begin to tell you how much I wanted this role. I definitely sit on the more obsessive side of things in terms of my character \u2013 I\u2019m obsessed with manifesting. I auditioned about three or four times and I was overwhelmed with how much I wanted it. It was so out of my comfort zone, and such a challenge.\u201d Aboah is keen to stress that this is something she has wanted for a long time. \u201cAt school, I wasn\u2019t passing with straight As or anything like that,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I really leaned into my more creative side.\u201d While experiments with the guitar proved unfruitful, \u201ctheatre was my first love. I was shy and nervous at boarding school. I was away from home, and away from my family and friends. Another girl had seen me sitting by myself all the time \u2013 she was like, \u2018This girl is quite depressed.\u2019 So she asked me if I wanted to audition for the school play. We\u2019re still friends now.\u201d Aboah was part of the National Youth Theatre and did a degree in drama. Rather than being seduced by the bright lights of the modelling industry, it seems she just wasn\u2019t in the right headspace for acting. \u201cAfter university, I didn\u2019t really have a good head on my shoulders \u2013 my work ethic wasn\u2019t necessarily that great.\u201d She was, she says, \u201ca bit distracted \u2026 by partying and all sorts of things. But before Covid, I knew that I really wanted to give it a chance. I got an agent and started doing acting classes.\u201d In Top Boy, she plays Becks, a love interest for Jasmine Jobson\u2019s tough-as-nails gang member Jaq. It\u2019s not a big role, but it is a memorable one, as the decidedly middle-class addition to a show set in a working-class world. There\u2019s even a scene where another character ponders why Becks doesn\u2019t tap up the bank of mum and dad for a bigger flat. As someone in a heterosexual relationship, did the prospect of portraying a same-sex couple \u2013 and one that attracts negative attention in the series \u2013 faze her? \u201cI think the women\u2019s storylines stand alone, away from what\u2019s going on with the men,\u201d she says. \u201cYou really get to know these women. By no means do I think I understand homophobia, but I was able to talk to friends in the queer community and get an understanding of what they\u2019ve had to deal with. And going back to what we\u2019ve been speaking about, I understand discrimination. I hope that I\u2019ve been able to tell the story authentically.\u201d What has it been like to engage with a series based on a world so different from her own background? \u201cLondon is filled with so many different people,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say that we\u2019re all segregated, and none of us mix. But living in west London, I\u2019ve been around different types of people my whole entire life. I might have gone to private school, but I\u2019ve been brought up around a multifaceted community. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt intimidated by being from a different world.\u201d Aboah has to catch her flight, but before she logs off, she tells me that she is already \u201con cloud nine\u201d at the prospect of showing what she can do as an actor. A few days after we speak, she posts a childhood photo on Instagram \u2013 possibly one dug out in her bedroom clearout. Unlike most people\u2019s childhood snaps, it was published in the triannual fashion magazine Pop, and shot by the photographer Alice Hawkins. In it, Aboah is dressed smartly, a serious look on her face and her hair in braids, younger but in many ways identical. Alongside it runs the caption: \u201cBy popular demand. Shy and 12 years old \u2026 Haven\u2019t changed at all \u2026\u201d Aboah\u2019s life has changed since those days, and yet in many ways she\u2019s stayed the same, as the world has changed around her. The picture reminds me of something she told me about her dad: \u201cHe turned to me, years ago, and said: \u2018I was just waiting for you to realise what you are capable of achieving.\u2019\u201d Binning her old magazines might have been a wrench, but it reminded her that she was always on the right track. \u2022 The new season of Top Boy is available now on Netflix.

I knew, from taking my pulse, that I had a problem called atrial fibrillation \u2013 and although it wasn\u2019t life-threatening, it did need to be fixed.

Since then, I have been into hospital dozens of times and had countless video consultations, scans and other investigations. All of this led to me having an ablation: a procedure that froze away the bit of my heart that Covid seemed to have damaged. This appears, for the moment, to have cured me. But when I sat down in the triage room and the nurse began covering me with stickers and electrodes to get a recording of my heart, all I felt was relief that someone was now looking after me. All I had had to do was turn up and say I didn\u2019t feel well.</p> <p>Healthcare has to be as frictionless as possible. As soon as people have to fill out forms, call an insurance company or produce a credit card, they stop coming. It is inconvenient enough being ill without having to do extra, expensive admin. I was a pretty dismal patient: I didn\u2019t want to take pills, I didn\u2019t want my operation and I complained every time they shaved my chest to stick on the electrodes. My treatment required extraordinary, underpaid people to care more than I did about what happened next. All I did was open the letters from the hospital, read them and turn up. In the US, the admin for a health problem like mine would have been a part-time job.</p> <p>But my doctors and nurses weren\u2019t getting paid for each procedure or each test, so there were no financial incentives distorting the decisions. They just wanted to find out what was wrong with me, fix me and get me out of the building. I trusted everyone and everyone who looked after me went above and beyond the simple requirements of the job.</p> <p>Three people stood out. First, Dr Phil Gothard, an old friend who happened to see me in an A&amp;E follow-up clinic. At the end of the consultation, he said: \u201cYou mustn\u2019t let being ill make you think differently about yourself. You\u2019re still the same person, just one bit of you isn\u2019t working very well.\u201d If I ever start seeing patients again, I will say that to all of them. Second was Prof Toby Hillman, a respiratory consultant at University College hospital. Faced with a new disease, he and his team had to figure out how to study it while they were treating it in the middle of the pandemic. Unbelievable. Finally, Dr Oliver Segal, who was eventually proved right about me needing an operation \u2013 and was gracious enough not to rub it in my face.</p> <p>Anyone who says the NHS needs to be improved is right. There are huge deficiencies in its abilities to meet people\u2019s needs and, in many ways, I was very lucky. But, in the past two years, I have learned that the core of its design is extraordinary. The nationalised system means that it relies on salaried professionals who are incentivised by the rewards of patient care. I wouldn\u2019t want to be ill in any healthcare system that didn\u2019t offer that.</p> <p><em>Xand van Tulleken is a doctor and the presenter of TV shows including How to Lose Weight Well</em></p>",

All of this led to me having an ablation: a procedure that froze away the bit of my heart that Covid seemed to have damaged. This appears, for the moment, to have cured me. But when I sat down in the triage room and the nurse began covering me with stickers and electrodes to get a recording of my heart, all I felt was relief that someone was now looking after me. All I had had to do was turn up and say I didn\u2019t feel well. Healthcare has to be as frictionless as possible. As soon as people have to fill out forms, call an insurance company or produce a credit card, they stop coming. It is inconvenient enough being ill without having to do extra, expensive admin. I was a pretty dismal patient: I didn\u2019t want to take pills, I didn\u2019t want my operation and I complained every time they shaved my chest to stick on the electrodes. My treatment required extraordinary, underpaid people to care more than I did about what happened next. All I did was open the letters from the hospital, read them and turn up. In the US, the admin for a health problem like mine would have been a part-time job. But my doctors and nurses weren\u2019t getting paid for each procedure or each test, so there were no financial incentives distorting the decisions. They just wanted to find out what was wrong with me, fix me and get me out of the building. I trusted everyone and everyone who looked after me went above and beyond the simple requirements of the job. Three people stood out. First, Dr Phil Gothard, an old friend who happened to see me in an A&amp;E follow-up clinic. At the end of the consultation, he said: \u201cYou mustn\u2019t let being ill make you think differently about yourself. You\u2019re still the same person, just one bit of you isn\u2019t working very well.\u201d If I ever start seeing patients again, I will say that to all of them. Second was Prof Toby Hillman, a respiratory consultant at University College hospital. Faced with a new disease, he and his team had to figure out how to study it while they were treating it in the middle of the pandemic. Unbelievable. Finally, Dr Oliver Segal, who was eventually proved right about me needing an operation \u2013 and was gracious enough not to rub it in my face. Anyone who says the NHS needs to be improved is right. There are huge deficiencies in its abilities to meet people\u2019s needs and, in many ways, I was very lucky. But, in the past two years, I have learned that the core of its design is extraordinary. The nationalised system means that it relies on salaried professionals who are incentivised by the rewards of patient care. I wouldn\u2019t want to be ill in any healthcare system that didn\u2019t offer that. Xand van Tulleken is a doctor and the presenter of TV shows including How to Lose Weight Well",

      "bodyText": "Going Out: Cinema Paris, 13th District Out now The French auteur Jacques Audiard is back, and on lighter form than his searing prison drama A Prophet. In this beautifully shot black-and-white contemporary romance, modern Parisians try their best to figure out their love lives and lives in general. Call it the thinking viewer\u2019s Emily in Paris. The Phantom of the Open Out now Mark Rylance tees up a feelgood underdog golfing story that\u2019s sure to score a hole in one with British audiences craving something lighter after all those heavy awards-season films earlier in the year. Based on a true story and directed by the likable actor-turned-director Craig Roberts, it also features Sally Hawkins. X Out now A new horror film from the reliably excellent Ti West is always cause for excitement, but this one has a particularly alluring premise for fans of the genre: starring Jenna Ortega, Mia Goth and Brittany Snow, it follows a group of adult movie stars as they journey to a remote location to film their latest opus. Hive Out now The first film ever to win all three of the top prizes at the Sundance film festival, this restrained drama is based on the true story of a woman who becomes an entrepreneur against the odds, following her husband\u2019s disappearance during the late-90s war in Kosovo. Catherine Bray * * * Going Out: Gigs Bill Laurance &amp; The Royal Academy of Music Big Band Ronnie Scott\u2019s Club, London 21 March, 6.30pm &amp; 10.30pm Keyboardist Bill Laurance, co-founder of the Grammy-winning jazz-funk band Snarky Puppy and imaginative genre-splicing composer, shares Jazzwise magazine\u2019s 25th-birthday celebrations with a punchy big band \u2013 and an agenda of Snarky hits, early originals, and new testaments to his cinematic use of jazz, global, and classical music. John Fordham Future Islands 23 March to 2 April; tour starts Manchester Nearly a decade after a viral performance on Letterman sent the band \u2013 and leg-waggling frontman Samuel T Herring \u2013 into orbit, their modus operandi hasn\u2019t really changed. New single King of Sweden continues their love of heart-on-sleeve synth-led art-rock, adding another hands-in-the-air live favourite to the Future Islands canon. Griff 19 to 29 March; tour starts Brighton Since winning the 2021 Brits Rising Star award, pop newcomer Griff has scored a Top 20 single with Black Hole, landed a Top 5 with debut mixtape One Foot in Front of the Other and shared some chips with Taylor Swift. This delayed UK tour could well be the last chance to catch her in smallish venues. BBCSO Total Immersion: Frank Zappa Barbican Hall, London, 19 March The latest of the BBC Symphony Orchestra\u2019s all-day specials is devoted to the unclassifiable, freewheeling genius of Frank Zappa. This celebration focuses on his ensemble and orchestral works, including a performance of his final album, The Yellow Shark, alongside some of the modernist scores by Stravinsky, Webern and Var\u00e8se that influenced him so much. Andrew Clements * * * Going Out: Stage The Burnt City Woolwich Works, 22 March to 28 August Immersive theatre maestros Punchdrunk return to London for the first time since 2014 with its largest ever production. Unfolding over two Grade II-listed buildings in Greenwich, it\u2019s a futuristic version of the fall of Troy. Epic. Miriam Gillinson The Metamorphosis Tron theatre, Glasgow, to 26 March A visually arresting take on Kafka\u2019s darkly captivating story, about a man who wakes up to discover he is a giant insect. This international co-production show received stellar reviews before closing early in lockdown. MG Suzi Ruffell Ashcroft Arts Centre, Fareham, 24 March; The Quay, Sudbury, 25 March A slow-burn success story, Ruffell is the kind of seasoned, self-assured standup whose well-honed skills make her a hugely comforting presence on stage. Drawing on her working-class Portsmouth childhood and her experiences of being gay, the 36-year-old makes class and sexuality the cornerstones of her matey and giddily silly routines. Rachel Aroesti Ballet Black Barbican Hall, London, 24 March to 27 March, then touring The pioneering ballet company celebrates 20 years of putting Black and Asian dancers in the spotlight with a new ballet, Say It Loud, charting the story of the company itself. Plus a premiere from South African choreographer Gregory Maqoma called Black Sun, with music from Kano producer Mikey J Asante. Lyndsey Winship * * * Going Out: Art Ky\u014dsai: The Israel Goldman Collection Royal Academy of Arts, London, to 19 June Japanese art had a revolutionary golden age in the early 1800s that culminated in Hokusai\u2019s 1831 masterpiece The Great Wave. But what happened next? This exhibition makes the case for Kawanabe Ky\u014dsai, who carried on making fantastical images of ghosts and courtesans to his death in 1889, as a modern great. Six Portraits: Surviving the Holocaust Holyroodhouse, Edinburgh, to 6 June The people in these paintings are dignified and advanced in years but they lived through the worst hell in history. Jenny Saville\u2019s portrait of Ziggi Shipper is the boldest, seeing him through a brown and grey wash that suggests old photos of that abyss. Hew Locke Tate Britain, 21 March to 22 January The sprawling assemblages of Hew Locke can fill Tate Britain\u2019s central hall without trying, and his ramshackle collage aesthetic should play effectively against its cold classical architecture. The history of empire suggested by the building may give him good ammunition, but he can be a bit scattergun in throwing stuff together. Alice\u2019s Wonderlands Waddesdon Manor, Aylesbury, 22 March to 30 October A celebration of the notable art collector Alice de Rothschild, whose brother Ferdinand built Waddesdon Manor as a neo-Renaissance chateau in the 19th century. This survey of her life and passions is packed with beautiful things. Jonathan Jones Staying In: Streaming Then Barbara Met Alan 9pm, 21 March, BBC Two and iPlayer From disability advocate and screen-writing king Jack Thorne, and deaf actor Genevieve Barr, comes this docudrama about disabled cabaret performers Barbara Lisicki and Alan Holdsworth, whose protests against patronising coverage and government cuts changed the lives of disabled people. Bridgerton 25 March, Netflix Shonda Rhimes\u2019 fantastical period romp returns after the colossal success of its height-of-lockdown debut, which made overnight stars of leads Phoebe Dynevor and Reg\u00e9-Jean Page. Season two switches focus to eldest Bridgerton brother Anthony, with new love interest Kate Sharma continuing the show\u2019s refreshingly inclusive approach to race. Pachinko 25 March, Apple TV+ Adapted from Min Jin Lee\u2019s bestselling novel of the same name, this epic 20th-century saga chronicles four generations of a Korean family who emigrate to Japan. Named after a Japanese arcade game, its characters\u2019 lives are buffeted by chance in a world as unpredictable as a slot machine. Dynasties II 8pm, 20 March, BBC One and iPlayer David Attenborough narrates this series about animals fighting for their children\u2019s survival. Puma mothers must swerve male attention, twin baby elephants battle mud, and cheetahs fend off hyenas. RA * * * Staying In: Games Mario Kart 8 Deluxe \u2013 Booster Course Pass Nintendo Switch Out now Another outing for the game that has entertained millions of families over the past few years, featuring remastered tracks from the N64, Wii, Game Boy and every other classic Nintendo console. Ghostwire: Tokyo Out March 25, PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S/X This paranormal action game has you running and fighting in the streets of a deserted Tokyo. Essentially, a game about punching ghosts. Keza MacDonald * * * Staying In: Albums Rosal\u00eda \u2013 Motomami Out now Split into two moods \u2013 the \u201cmoto\u201d half the aggressive flipside to the softer \u201cmami\u201d \u2013 Spanish superstar Rosal\u00eda\u2019s long-awaited third album can give you whiplash. While Saoko and the ludicrous Chicken Teriyaki gleefully play with reggaeton\u2019s limits, Como Un G, co-written with James Blake, lets the wound left by a broken relationship slowly bleed out. Charli XCX \u2013 Crash Out now Swapping the PC Music-assisted hyperpop of her last few releases in favour of a more chart-friendly concoction (Beg for You\u2019s TikTok-focused UK garage, for example), Charli XCX returns with her gleaming fifth album. Originally billed as \u201cthe Janet album\u201d, the influence of Miss Jackson (if you\u2019re nasty) can be heard on sweaty recent single Baby. Midlake \u2013 For the Sake of Bethel Woods Out now Nine years after their fourth album, Antiphon, Texan quintet Midlake return from years spent on solo projects and interior design with their most musically diverse offering. While 1970s-influenced folk-rock is still their foundation, songs like the six-minute Noble meander gracefully around sighing electronics and fractured guitars. Babeheaven \u2013 Sink Into Me Out now West London\u2019s alt-pop practitioners Babeheaven make music for lonely 4am bus journeys. Their debut album, 2020\u2019s tellingly titled Home for Now, reflected life locked in, and while this atmospheric follow-up continues that sense of disconnection, songs like swirling highlight The Hours, for example, offer up glimmers of hope.

By the time I was dressed, my wife was nailing pictures to the wall. \u201cWhere did this rug come from?\u201d I said. \u201cI just need you to carry my table up,\u201d she said, beaming. \u201cAnd to put my day bed together.\u201d \u201cDay bed?\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s in a box downstairs,\u201d she said. Within the hour she had installed herself and let it be known that from now on access was by appointment only. Standing up from my desk, I wonder if I need to print out the invitation to see the new chair. I also wonder if it\u2019s really just an invitation to assemble the new chair. I cross the garden to the kitchen and head upstairs. From the landing I can see the youngest one in his bedroom, working. The door beyond his is firmly shut. I open it. My wife looks up from her computer. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d she says. \u201cI believe I\u2019m expected,\u201d I say. \u201cLook!\u201d she says, pointing to the tubular steel chair, padded in some kind of fake leather. \u201cForty-five pounds!\u201d \u201cNice,\u201d I say, thinking: no assembly required. \u201cBut it\u2019s not really a desk chair.\u201d \u201cI already have a desk chair,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s just for when people come up to see me. Not you.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s fine: I can always sit here,\u201d I say, flopping on to the day bed. \u201cNo,\u201d she says. Light streams through the window. \u201cComfortable,\u201d I say, lying down. The day bed is where the oldest one will sleep if he ever comes home again. \u201cOK, you\u2019re dismissed, thanks,\u201d my wife says. \u201cThis is a cool place to hang out in the afternoons,\u201d I say, closing my eyes. \u201cPlease,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m trying to work.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re all trying to work,\u201d says the youngest one from next door. \u201cI also have work to do,\u201d I say. \u201cI could bring my laptop up here for a bit.\u201d \u201cGet out,\u201d my wife says. I retreat to the kitchen and, eventually, back to my office shed, where I sit staring at a computer screen until the sun goes down and the heater clicks off. I don\u2019t begrudge my wife her new office, even if it\u2019s bigger than mine, and nicer than mine, with a commanding view of the street, and its own bed. She deserves a room of her own. She has waited a long time for it. And she will never know that I sometimes go up and sit in there when she\u2019s out, because I will be able to see her approaching from a long way off. It\u2019s past 6:30pm when I go in and pour myself a glass of wine, putting the last of the peanuts in a bowl. The sitting room, to my surprise, is dark and cold. The curtains have yet to be drawn. And in the spot where my wife had been hard at work every time I entered this room over the past two years, there are only a few boxes and part of a dusty drum kit. I close the curtains, turn on a few lights, remove my shoes and sit down on the sofa. But before I turn on the TV, I sit in silence for a while, straining to hear my wife\u2019s fingers tapping at her keyboard upstairs.",

His response to the deepfake, which remains of unknown provenance and is not of a high quality, received more than 5m views.</p> <p>Social media platforms swung into action as well. Facebook and Instagram\u2019s owner, Meta, said it had removed the video from its services and tipped off other platforms after the deepfake appeared on a reportedly hacked Ukrainian news site and started spreading across the internet. Twitter said it was \u201cactively\u201d tracking the video and removing it if it was being displayed without comment or held up as real.</p> <p>Sam Gregory, programme director at Witness, a technology-focused human rights group, said the Ukrainian response showed Zelenskiy\u2019s team had an effective strategy in place to deal with this type of disinformation. \u201cThe Ukrainians had warned about a video like this,\u201d he said, referring to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/shortcuts/2018/feb/20/pre-bunking-can-you-be-brainwashed-into-spotting-fake-news\">pre-bunking</a> efforts. \u201cThen the video itself was poor quality and discernible as faked to the human eye and ear. And then the subject of the deepfake was able to rapidly rebut it in real-time, via his own social media channels to an audience who trusts him.\u201d</p> <p>One expert said the concept of an infowar between Russia and Ukraine and its allies needed be seen in a global context.</p> <p>\u201cUkraine is doing an extraordinary job. It is making sure the world understands the gravity of the situation and the fight that they\u2019re undertaking on behalf of the rest of democracy,\u201d said Andy Carvin, managing editor of the digital forensic research lab at the Atlantic Council, a US thinktank. Russia has \u201cflailed and fumbled\u201d, he said, including by \u201cposting questionable videos of doubtful provenance\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/volunteer-hackers-fight-russia\">Hackers have claimed success</a> too in hampering the state narrative inside Russia, with the RT news service among the websites targeted by distributed denial of service attacks that render sites unreachable. The volume of DDoS attacks since the Russia-Ukraine conflict began has \u201cdisproportionately targeted Russia\u201d, according to Recorded Future, which monitors cyber threats.</p> <p>But Carvin cautioned against drawing only positive conclusions from the infowar. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy for us in the west to assume well, they stink at this, and Ukraine is winning the argument online and in public discourse.

      "bodyText": "Speaking behind a podium bearing the Ukrainian state emblem, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in his now signature green attire, calls on his soldiers to lay down their weapons and return to their families. The one-minute clip is a deepfake, the term for a sophisticated hoax that uses artificial intelligence to create a phoney image, most commonly fake videos of people. What unfolded next was the latest episode in the infowar that has accompanied the Russia-Ukraine conflict, a war being waged across social media platforms, via satellite images of battlefields and on hackers\u2019 keyboards. Zelenskiy posted a bona fide response on his Instagram account on Wednesday dismissing the \u201cchildish provocation\u201d and telling Russian troops to return home. His response to the deepfake, which remains of unknown provenance and is not of a high quality, received more than 5m views. Social media platforms swung into action as well. Facebook and Instagram\u2019s owner, Meta, said it had removed the video from its services and tipped off other platforms after the deepfake appeared on a reportedly hacked Ukrainian news site and started spreading across the internet. Twitter said it was \u201cactively\u201d tracking the video and removing it if it was being displayed without comment or held up as real. Sam Gregory, programme director at Witness, a technology-focused human rights group, said the Ukrainian response showed Zelenskiy\u2019s team had an effective strategy in place to deal with this type of disinformation. \u201cThe Ukrainians had warned about a video like this,\u201d he said, referring to pre-bunking efforts. \u201cThen the video itself was poor quality and discernible as faked to the human eye and ear. And then the subject of the deepfake was able to rapidly rebut it in real-time, via his own social media channels to an audience who trusts him.\u201d One expert said the concept of an infowar between Russia and Ukraine and its allies needed be seen in a global context. \u201cUkraine is doing an extraordinary job. It is making sure the world understands the gravity of the situation and the fight that they\u2019re undertaking on behalf of the rest of democracy,\u201d said Andy Carvin, managing editor of the digital forensic research lab at the Atlantic Council, a US thinktank. Russia has \u201cflailed and fumbled\u201d, he said, including by \u201cposting questionable videos of doubtful provenance\u201d. Hackers have claimed success too in hampering the state narrative inside Russia, with the RT news service among the websites targeted by distributed denial of service attacks that render sites unreachable. The volume of DDoS attacks since the Russia-Ukraine conflict began has \u201cdisproportionately targeted Russia\u201d, according to Recorded Future, which monitors cyber threats. But Carvin cautioned against drawing only positive conclusions from the infowar. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy for us in the west to assume well, they stink at this, and Ukraine is winning the argument online and in public discourse. But if you look around region by region, or even within certain countries, you\u2019ll see very different narratives spreading.\u201d Carvin pointed to Russia, where Facebook and Instagram are blocked, access to Twitter is heavily restricted, all western content has been barred on TikTok, and dissent has been all but quashed. \u201cFrom Putin\u2019s perspective, domestically, I think he\u2019s probably fairly happy with where things stand,\u201d he said. Internationally, RT and another state-owned news service, Sputnik, have been removed in the UK and EU by Facebook and Instagram, and RT\u2019s UK broadcast licence was revoked on Friday. But Carvin noted that RT and Sputnik are \u201cthriving\u201d in South America and pointed to a recent study showing that 50% of posts examined on Weibo, the Chinese social media platform, backed Russia\u2019s argument that the war was the fault of western countries, Nato or Ukraine. In places like sub-Saharan Africa, he said, the Russian narrative was also playing well. \u201cRegion by region, it\u2019s not necessarily looking as great as it may appear through our lenses,\u201d he said.

Before the Russian onslaught began, Okhtyrka, which sits in Ukraine\u2019s north-eastern Sumy region, was a small, bustling city that was home to about 48,000 people. Today, after three weeks of almost daily bombing, it is a flame-licked, smoke-choked and rubble-strewn shadow of the place it once was. More than half Okhtyrka\u2019s population have fled, and reports that it has been razed are hardly fanciful. The train station is gone, pummelled with an explosive ferocity that has flipped over some of the heavy freight wagons. Gone too are the town hall, a shopping centre and a local cultural centre. A single bomb managed to obliterate three houses and destroy the windows and balconies of a pair of nine-storey buildings 100 metres away. A large crater has been gouged in the ground, and a persistent smoke rises from the splintered wood and atomised masonry spewed on to the streets. \u201cTwo elderly ladies died in these houses today,\u201d said Kuzmenko, pointing to the results of the latest Russian strike. More bodies could lie in the debris. \u201cLook around, this is a residential area. There\u2019s no military facility nearby, just a small river and a forest.\u201d For all the talk and predictions of cyberwarfare and disinformation that followed the last Russian invasion in 2014, Putin\u2019s latest war is an old-fashioned one of maps, battles and massive civilian suffering. Okhtyrka\u2019s thermal power station, which was taken out not by a cyber-attack but by a bomb, has been partially repaired, but people are struggling \u2013 especially when temperatures drop to -12C at night. Many women took their children and left during the first few days. But many people remained, among them elderly people who have nowhere to go and do not want to leave their homes.

According to Amnesty International, an attack on an Okhtyrka kindergarten on 25 February \u2013 which killed three people, including a child, as they sought shelter \u2013 involved widely banned cluster munitions from a 220mm Uragan rocket. \u201cThis is from a BM-27 Uragan multiple rocket launcher system,\u201d said Vlad, a Ukrainian soldier, as he examined the debris at the kindergarten.

In spite of the ceaseless bombing, the deaths and the daily funerals, Kuzmenko was not the only one looking past the debris of the present and towards a phoenix-like future for Okhtyrka. When would the war be over, we asked Halyna, the lab assistant. \u201cHonestly, I believe that when the tulips bloom, the war will end. I believe it,\u201d she said. \u201cI see how the town is dying in front of our eyes, but we\u2019re young, and those who have left will return to rebuild it. Our dear Okhtyrka will stand, and our Ukraine will last. We will welcome spring with joy. We will go to our beaches. We will take a rest in our green meadows and hills. We will enjoy the beauty here.\u201d Nataliya Gumenyuk is a Ukrainian journalist and the director of Public Interest Journalism Lab",

For example, introducing herbivores such as Highland cattle to upland areas can help to redistribute seeds and nutrients over wide areas and promote plant growth. But too many herbivores can result in overgrazing, so carnivores are vital too. Get the balance right and the carbon benefits are huge: an estimated 10% of US carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels could be mopped up by North American boreal forests, if they contained the correct balance of wolves, moose and trees.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14139486a31e9a692e6e36654ce34abb1603db5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14139486a31e9a692e6e36654ce34abb1603db5c/0_854_2592_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A wolf in snow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Predators such as wolves help to keep herbivore numbers in check and prevent overgrazing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacqueline Batrus</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s not just on land that animals can help.

      "bodyText": "Rewilding has the potential to supercharge climate mitigation, says the Global Rewilding Alliance, an umbrella group for organisations working to restore ecosystems. Sunday 20 March is World Rewilding Day, and the focus this year is on the critical importance of wild animals for the climate. Rewilding landscapes with wolves and wildebeest could be even more important than planting trees. Adding the right animals to the right landscape can help to rebalance the ecosystem and maximise the amount of carbon that can be stored. For example, introducing herbivores such as Highland cattle to upland areas can help to redistribute seeds and nutrients over wide areas and promote plant growth. But too many herbivores can result in overgrazing, so carnivores are vital too. Get the balance right and the carbon benefits are huge: an estimated 10% of US carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels could be mopped up by North American boreal forests, if they contained the correct balance of wolves, moose and trees. It\u2019s not just on land that animals can help. Ocean predators such as whales devour prey in deep water and excrete nutrients at the surface, promoting phytoplankton production that draws down carbon dioxide. The take-home message: we\u2019re going to need wolves as well as wind turbines to stand any chance of capping global heating at 1.5C.",

Six in the Sumy region, one in the Donetsk region. <br>More than 9,000 people were evacuated from the besieged Mariupol, he said, and hundreds of tons of essential products were delivered. But he added: \u201cThe occupiers continue to block the supply of humanitarian aid to the besieged cities in most areas. This is a totally deliberate tactic. They have a clear order to do absolutely everything to make the humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities an \u2018argument\u2019 for Ukrainians to cooperate with the occupiers. This is a war crime.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>No new information on fatalities following a Russian airstrike on a theatre in Mariupol</strong><br>Zelenskiy said people were being rescued from the rubble, and that more than 130 people had been rescued so far. \u201cSome of them are seriously wounded.

      "bodyText": "Thank you for following our Ukraine liveblog. We have launched a new blog here where you can stay abreast of all the latest developments. Years of tension between Moscow and US-based Facebook and Twitter erupted into confrontation after the invasion of Ukraine, with the platforms targeting state-tied media and then finding themselves restricted in Russia, reports Associated Press. How likely is Russia to block chat platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram? Here\u2019s some analysis from AP. Messaging apps have gotten a pass so far in part because Meta-owned WhatsApp is less suited for mass communication, while Telegram\u2019s ability to blast information to large groups has made it useful both for independent media and the Kremlin. \u201cI think it\u2019s unlikely Russia will ban Telegram because they are so short on platforms where they can operate,\u201d said Sergey Sanovich, a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University, who noted that authorities in 2020 aborted efforts to block the service. Telegram, criticized as having a lax content policing policy, offers a forum for Russian authorities to promote narratives friendly to their internationally condemned war. Russia still operates accounts on platforms like Facebook, despite blocking the service at home, but this week the Silicon Valley giant took down posts from Moscow\u2019s pages that contained misinformation about its deadly offensive. Telegram has become an essential exchange for news on the war, with its growth accelerating after the Kremlin\u2019s latest crackdown on independent media and the lock-out of apps like Facebook and Instagram. An average of 2.5 million new users joined Telegram daily in the last three weeks, the firm said, about a 25 percent jump from the weeks prior. But experts highlighted a risk to Telegram and its users due to a lack of default, end-to-end encryption that potentially leaves the company susceptible to government pressure to turn over information. Alp Toker, director of web monitoring group NetBlocks, noted WhatsApp has put in place firestops that offer insulation against that sort of pressure. \u201cBy improving their security and adopting end-to-end encryption technology, they have essentially protected their own platform from legal risk and potential demands for content access requests,\u201d Toker added. WhatsApp\u2019s use for one-on-one or group chats make it less of a target for Russian authorities for now, but that could change if it became known as a key platform for protests against the war. In the early hours of Saturday, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy released a video address in which he told Moscow that now was the time for urgent peace talks, warning that Russian losses will otherwise be so huge it will take generations to recover. Here are some of the key points from his speech: Russia has continued to block the supply of aid to besieged cities \u201cin most areas\u201d Zelenskiy said that on Friday there were seven humanitarian corridors in Ukraine. Six in the Sumy region, one in the Donetsk region. More than 9,000 people were evacuated from the besieged Mariupol, he said, and hundreds of tons of essential products were delivered. But he added: \u201cThe occupiers continue to block the supply of humanitarian aid to the besieged cities in most areas. This is a totally deliberate tactic. They have a clear order to do absolutely everything to make the humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities an \u2018argument\u2019 for Ukrainians to cooperate with the occupiers. This is a war crime.\u201d No new information on fatalities following a Russian airstrike on a theatre in Mariupol Zelenskiy said people were being rescued from the rubble, and that more than 130 people had been rescued so far. \u201cSome of them are seriously wounded. But at the moment there is no information about the dead,\u201d he said. Hundreds of civilians were sheltering in the theatre. He thanked those defending Mariupol, saying the city was experiencing \u201cthe greatest ordeal in its history, in the history of Ukraine.\u201d Russian forces had been stopped \u201cin almost all directions\u201d Zelenskiy said Russian forces were halted across many areas of the country. He said there was heavy fighting in the Kharkiv region, especially near Izyum, but that Russian troops were unprepared. (There is more analysis on the state of the conflict, from Institute of the Study of War, in an earlier post) \u201cMeaningful, fair\u201d negotiations were urgently needed. Zelenskiy told Moscow: \u201cIt\u2019s time to meet. Time to talk. It is time to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine. Otherwise Russia\u2019s losses will be so huge that several generations will not be enough to rebound.\u201d He said: \u201cNegotiations on peace, on security for us, for Ukraine - meaningful, fair and without delay - are the only chance for Russia to reduce the damage from its own mistakes.\u201d On the international response: Zelenskiy said he would continue to appeal to world leaders to call for peace in Ukraine, with plans to address Switzerland, Italy, Israel and Japan. He has spoken with Ukrainian ambassadors around the world \u201cto intensify the supply of humanitarian goods\u201d for displaced people in Ukraine. A coordination headquarters has also been set up to oversee the delivery of humanitarian aid to Ukraine, he said. Ukraine\u2019s defence ministry said late on Friday it lost access to the Sea of Azov \u201ctemporarily\u201d as invading Russian forces were tightening their grip around the Sea\u2019s major port of Mariupol, Reuters reports. More from Reuters: \u201cThe occupiers have partially succeeded in the Donetsk operational district, temporarily depriving Ukraine of access to the Sea of Azov,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s defence ministry said in a statement. The ministry did not specify in its statement whether Ukraine\u2019s forces have regained access to the Sea. Russia said on Friday its forces were \u201ctightening the noose\u201d around Mariupol, where an estimated 80% of the city\u2019s homes had been damaged more some 1,000 people may still be trapped in makeshift bomb shelters beneath a destroyed theatre. Mariupol, with its strategic location on the coast of the Sea of Azov, has been a target since the start of the war on Feb. 24 when Russian President Vladimir Putin launched what he called a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d. The city lies on the route between the Russian-annexed peninsula of Crimea to the west, and the Donetsk region to the east, which is partially controlled by pro-Russian separatists. Russia claimed as early as March 1 that its forces had cut off the Ukrainian military from the Sea of Azov. Three Russian cosmonauts arrived at the International Space Station on Friday wearing yellow flight suits with blue accents, colours that appeared to match the Ukrainian flag, Associated Press reports. Here is some further detail from AP: The men were the first new arrivals on the space station since the start of the Russian war in Ukraine last month. Russian space corporation Roscosmos cosmonauts Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveyev and Sergey Korsakov blasted off successfully from the Russia-leased Baikonur launch facility in Kazakhstan in their Soyuz MS-21 spacecraft at 8:55 p.m. Friday (11:55 a.m. EDT). They smoothly docked at the station just over three hours later, joining two Russians, four Americans and a German on the orbiting outpost. Video of Artemyev taken as the spacecraft prepared to dock with the space station showed him wearing a blue flight suit. It was unclear what, if any, message the yellow uniforms they changed into were intended to send. When the cosmonauts were able to talk to family back on Earth, Artemyev was asked about the suits. He said every crew chooses their own. \u201cIt became our turn to pick a colour. But in fact, we had accumulated a lot of yellow material so we needed to use it. So that\u2019s why we had to wear yellow,\u201d he said. Since the war started, many people have used the Ukrainian flag and its colours to show solidarity with the country. The war has resulted in canceled spacecraft launches and broken contracts. Samantha Power, who leads the US Agency for International Development (USAid), has said Ukraine and Moldova have successfully synchronised with the European electric grid, stabilising power supplies. The development was announced by the European Commission earlier this week, which said the work would keep \u201chomes warm and lights on during these dark times.\u201d Ukrainian forces conducted a major successful counterattack around Mykolayiv, in southern Ukraine, over the past several days, according to the Institute of the Study of War, a US thinktank tracking the fighting. In a recent update, ISW said that Russian forces continued to secure territorial gains only around Mariupol on Friday and that Russian forces face growing morale and supply problems. This includes growing reports of self-mutilation among Russian troops to avoid deployment to Ukraine and shortages of key guided munitions. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces \u201ccontinue step by step to liberate the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine in all directions\u201d on Friday, the first Ukrainian mention of conducting counterattacks \u201cin all directions\u201d, according to ISW. Belgium on Friday delayed by a decade a plan to scrap nuclear energy in 2025, spooked by the huge rise in energy prices due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, reports AFP. Here is some more detail from AFP\u2019s report: The push to 2035 comes as calls are rising that neighbouring Germany, Europe\u2019s biggest economy, should also rethink its nuclear energy exit, but ministers in Berlin last week doubled down on their country\u2019s no atom pledge despite the price shock. Europe is scrambling to find ways to wean itself off its energy dependency on Russia, which provides 40% of Europe\u2019s gas needs, mainly to Germany, Italy and several central European countries. Prices have skyrocketed for Europeans since the invasion by Russia of Ukraine and EU leaders will meet next week to agree on fresh emergency measures to soften the blow for consumers and businesses. A US military aircraft with four people on board has crashed in northern Norway, reports Reuters. The MV-22B Osprey aircraft belonging to the US Marine Corps was taking part in a NATO military exercise called Cold Response when it was reported missing at 1826 CET (1726 GMT), according to Norway\u2019s Joint Rescue Coordination Centres (JRCC). Here is some more detail from Reuters: A rescue helicopter and a Norwegian military Orion plane searching the area spotted the wreckage from the air at 2017 GMT after receiving an emergency signal. \u201cWe\u2019ve discovered an aircraft that has crashed. We\u2019ve seen no sign of life,\u201d Nordland police chief of staff Bent Eilertsen told Reuters. \u201cWe\u2019ve been told it\u2019s an American aircraft with four Americans on board,\u201d he said. Because of the bad weather, the rescue aircraft could not land. Instead, police and rescue services were trying to reach the site by land, but it was unclear how long this could take. \u201cIt\u2019s dark, the weather conditions are bad and there is a risk of avalanches,\u201d Eilertsen said. The plane was on a training exercise and had been due to land at around 1800 CET (1700 GMT). Weather was bad in the area, with conditions worsening. Two former US presidents, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, showed their support for Ukraine on Friday, by placing bouquets of sunflowers, the country\u2019s national emblem, outside a church in Chicago. They wore blue and yellow ribbons in the colours of Ukraine\u2019s flag, and placed the flowers in front of the Catholic Church of Saints Volodymyr and Olha. A video of the gesture was shared on Clinton\u2019s Twitter account, alongside a post that said: \u201cAmerica stands united with the people of Ukraine in their fight for freedom and against oppression.\u201d It sets the former presidents apart from Donald Trump, writes AFP. It reports: \u201c[Trump] just before the invasion described Vladimir Putin\u2019s strategy of amassing troops on Russia\u2019s border with Ukraine and then recognizing the independence of two pro-Russian separatist territories as a stroke of \u2018genius.\u2019\u201d As Russia\u2019s devastating war on Ukraine drags on, the question of whether to keep buying and selling Russian diamonds is a quandary for jewellers, diamond companies and the industry bodies set up to regulate them \u2013 many of which depend on the country\u2019s state-controlled diamond sector for supply. Industry insiders say US sanctions will do little or nothing to stop the flow of diamonds from Alrosa, Russia\u2019s enormous state-backed mining monopoly, to the west. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has released a video address saying the time has come for peace talks, warning it will otherwise take generations for Russia to recover from losses suffered during the war. Reuters has released the following summary of his speech: Zelenskiy said Ukraine had always offered solutions for peace and wanted meaningful and honest negotiations on peace and security, without delay. \u201cI want everyone to hear me now, especially in Moscow. The time has come for a meeting, it is time to talk,\u201d he said in a video address released in the early hours of Saturday. \u201cThe time has come to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine. Otherwise, Russia\u2019s losses will be such that it will take you several generations to recover.\u201d The two sides have been involved in talks for weeks with no sign of a breakthrough. Zelenskiy said Russian forces were deliberately blocking the supply of humanitarian supplies to cities under attack. \u201cThis is a deliberate tactic ... This is a war crime and they will answer for it, 100%,\u201d he said. Zelenskiy said there was no information about how many people had died after a theatre in the city of Mariupol, where hundreds of people had been sheltering, was struck on Wednesday. More than 130 people had been rescued so far, he said. A teenager was overwhelmed when Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy shook her hand and gave her flowers during a visit to people wounded by Russian attacks at a Kyiv hospital on Thursday. Sixteen-year-old Katya Vlasenko, who was wounded when the car her family was travelling in came under fire, told the president he was a hero on social media platform TikTok, to which Zelenskiy responded: \u201cOh yes? So we have occupied TikTok?\u201d Katya\u2019s family was trying to escape fighting in the area north-west of the capital Kyiv when their car came under fire near Hostomel. It\u2019s Rebecca Ratcliffe here in Bangkok, I\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest developments on the war in Ukraine today. It\u2019s nearly 2am in Ukraine; here\u2019s where things stand: Ukraine\u2019s interior minster told Associated Press that it will take years to find and defuse all of the unexploded ordnances from the country. Denys Monastyrsky said: \u201cA huge number of shells and mines have been fired at Ukraine and a large part haven\u2019t exploded, they remain under the rubble and pose a real threat. It will take years, not months, to defuse them.\u201d Sergei Lavrov, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, praised Fox News for its coverage of the war in Ukraine during an in-studio interview with the Russian state-controlled RT network. \u201cWe know the manners and the tricks that are being used by the western countries to manipulate media ... If you take the United States, only Fox News is trying to present some alternative point of view,\u201d Lavrov said. The European Union is considering creating a solidarity fund for Ukraine. The plan was announced on Friday and is meant to be used for people\u2019s basic necessities. An EU official told Reuters the creation of the fund would be discussed at a summit of EU leaders next week. Fighting has reached the centre of the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol, where 350,000 civilians have been stranded with little food or water. The Russian defence ministry said its forces were \u201ctightening the noose\u201d around the city, and that \u201cfighting against nationalists\u201d was taking place in the city centre. Mariupol\u2019s mayor, Vadym Boichenko, appeared to confirm the claim. Russian missiles struck an aircraft repair plant in the western city of Lviv, 50 miles from Ukraine\u2019s border with Poland and a safe haven for hundreds of thousands of internally displaced Ukrainians. Blasts were heard at about 6am on Friday, preceded by the sound of air raid sirens, as a mushroom-shaped plume of smoke could be seen rising in the sky. Russia\u2019s bombardment in the east of Ukraine continued on Friday. In the eastern city of Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s state emergency service said a multi-storey teaching building had been shelled on Friday morning, killing one person, wounding 11 and trapping one other in the rubble. Shells were also said to have struck the eastern city of Kramatorsk, killing two people and wounding six. In the northern part of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, one person was killed and four others wounded after parts of a Russian missile fell on a residential building. Hundreds of people remain buried under the rubble of a theatre in the devastated city of Mariupol that was hit by a Russian airstrike on Wednesday, Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said. In a video address, Zelenskiy said that more than 130 people have been rescued so far but officials have said rescue efforts had been hindered by the complete breakdown of social services in the city and fears of future Russian attacks. Kyiv city administration said today that 222 people have been killed in the Ukrainian capital since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, including 60 civilians and four children. In a statement, it said a further 889 people have been wounded, including 241 civilians and 18 children, in the capital. The Guardian has not been able to verify these figures. Russian forces are \u201cholding captive\u201d a Ukrainian journalist, Victoria Roshchyna, according to the Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske. In a statement, Hromadske said they believe Roshchyna was detained by the Russian FSB around 15 March. Six and a half million people are currently displaced within Ukraine, the UN has said today, nearly twice as many as have managed to flee the country. The new figure, which dwarfs the 3.3 million refugees who have entered mainly EU territory, is a big jump on the UN\u2019s last estimate of 1.85 million. Refugees now fleeing Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine are \u201cmore traumatised\u201d than those who escaped in the first phase of the war, the UN said. Daily border crossings from Ukraine into Poland, the country that has received the most arrivals, have fallen by around half from a peak of about 100,000 daily, Reuters quoted UN refugee agency official, Matthew Saltmarsh, as saying. The US president, Joe Biden, described to China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, in a phone call today \u201cimplications and consequences\u201d if Beijing provides material support to Russia as it attacks Ukrainian cities and civilians, the White House said. \u201cThe Ukraine crisis is something that we don\u2019t want to see,\u201d Xi was quoted by Chinese media as saying to the US president. Ukraine\u2019s position is unchanged in talks with Russia, Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak said. Earlier today, a member of Russia\u2019s negotiating team said Moscow and Kyiv are most aligned on Ukraine\u2019s neutrality and giving up on joining Nato. Podolyak accused Russian statements of attempting \u201cto provoke tension in the media\u201d. Vladimir Putin praised Russian \u201cunity\u201d over what the Kremlin is calling its special operation in Ukraine during a rare public speech at the national stadium in Moscow. As Putin was finishing his speech, the broadcast was suddenly cut off and state television showed patriotic songs. The Kremlin\u2019s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov blamed a \u201ctechnical failure\u201d for the cutoff. A World Food Programme (WFP) official said on Friday that food supply chains in Ukraine were collapsing, with a portion of infrastructure destroyed and many grocery stores and warehouses now empty. Jakob Kern, WFP emergency coordinator for the Ukraine crisis, also expressed concern about the situation in \u201cencircled cities\u201d such as Mariupol, saying supplies were running out and its convoys had not yet been able to enter the city. Pope Francis has denounced the \u201cperverse abuse of power\u201d on display in Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and called for aid to Ukrainians, whom he said had been attacked in their \u201cidentity, history and tradition\u201d and were \u201cdefending their land\u201d. Francis\u2019 comments were some of his strongest yet in asserting Ukraine\u2019s right to exist as a sovereign state and to defend itself against Russia\u2019s invasion. Celebrities including Billy Porter, Audra McDonald and Steve Martin are going to appear on a 10-hour telethon to raise money for Ukrainian victims of war. The \u201cStars in the House\u201d program is set to air Saturday 26 March from 12pm Eastern time on YouTube, SiriusXM and the program\u2019s website. Money raised during the telethon will go toward humanitarian efforts and the International Rescue Committee. On Friday, Halliburton, an oilfield services provider, said it has paused its future business in Russia. Reuters has more on what this suspension may look like. Oilfield services company Halliburton Co said on Friday it has suspended future business in Russia, including for certain state-owned Russian customers, in compliance with US sanctions after Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The company said it has no active joint ventures in the country and had weeks ago halted all shipments of specific sanctioned parts and products to Russia. Other Western energy companies such as BP PLC, Shell and Norway\u2019s Equinor ASA have either suspended business or announced plans to abandon their Russia operations, leaving behind their investments. Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a \u201cspecial operation\u201d, is among the world\u2019s largest oil and gas producers that mainly relies on homegrown service providers. Earlier this month, oil major Exxon Mobil said it would exit Russia oil and gas operations valued at more than $4 billion and halt new investment.\u201d It will likely take years to defuse all of the unexploded Russian ordnances, the Associated Press reports. Denys Monastyrsky, Ukraine\u2019s interior minister, said on Friday that the nation will need US help to unearth and defuse Russian mines which are hidden under rubble and to remove explosives placed at bridges and airports by Ukrainian forces. The AP further reports: \u201cA huge number of shells and mines have been fired at Ukraine and a large part haven\u2019t exploded, they remain under the rubble and pose a real threat,\u201d Monastyrsky said. \u201cIt will take years, not months, to defuse them.\u201d In addition to the unexploded Russian ordnances, the Ukrainian troops also have planted land mines at bridges, airports and other key infrastructure to prevent Russians from using them. \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to remove the mines from all that territory, so I asked our international partners and colleagues from the European Union and the United States to prepare groups of experts to demine the areas of combat and facilities that came under shelling,\u201d Monastyrsky told the AP. He noted that another top challenge is dealing with fires caused by the relentless Russian barrages. He said there\u2019s a desperate shortage of personnel and equipment to deal with the fires amid the constant shelling. A Washington Post report is giving readers a glimpse into the efforts under way to get much-needed military equipment to Ukrainian soldiers. The article was set at a military base where Ukrainian forces received convoys with everything from dozens of vehicles to night-vision gear and surveillance drones. Ukrainian factories have been impacted by shelling, which has led the country\u2019s forces to rely on \u201cpop-up supply chains like for vital gear, including body armor, medical supplies and the pickup trucks and SUVs they covet as fighting vehicles\u201d, the article states. The Washington Post further reports: Receiving much of the donated money and supplies is Blue and Yellow, a nonprofit founded in 2014 to supply Ukrainians fighting the takeover of eastern parts of their country by Russian-backed separatists. Now the group is the focal point of Lithuania\u2019s yearning to help. Read the rest of the article here. Russia\u2019s foreign minister praised Fox News for its coverage of the war in Ukraine. During an in-studio appearance on the Russian state-controlled RT network, Sergei Lavrov, said: \u201cWe know the manners and the tricks that are being used by the western countries to manipulate media... If you take the United States, only Fox News is trying to present some alternative point of view.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Joanna Walters reports that Lavrov\u2019s comments came as six western nations accused Moscow of using the UN security council to launder disinformation and spread propaganda, after Russian diplomats again raised allegations that the US was involved in biological weapons, which have been repeatedly denied by both Washington and Ukraine. Read the rest of her coverage here. It is just after 11pm in Ukraine. Here is where things stand: The European Union is considering creating a solidarity fund for Ukraine.

Hello, I am Aben\u00e9 Clayton, a California-based Guardian reporter. I\u2019ll be bringing our blog readers the latest news out of Ukraine for the next couple of hours. The European Union is considering creating a solidarity fund for Ukraine, to help provide basic services in the country and meet citizens\u2019 immediate needs, European Council president Charles Michel said on Friday. \u201cThe fund would give liquidity for continued support to authorities and in the longer term serve as backbone for reconstruction of a free and democratic Ukraine once hostilities stop,\u201d Michel said in a tweet. \u201cThe bravery and resilience Ukrainians are showing is humbling,\u201d Michel said. \u201cThe #EU will continue to stand by you in the face of the Kremlin\u2019s aggression.\u201d An EU official told Reuters the creation of the fund would be discussed at a summit of EU leaders next week. The Russian invasion has cut Ukraine off from international financial markets, and the fund could provide the liquidity needed to keep government services running, to continue defence efforts and to provide basic services, Reuters reported. The Biden administration is still concerned that China is considering answering Russia\u2019s request for military equipment, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a briefing. \u201cWe have that concern. The president detailed what the implications and consequences would be if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians. And that is something we\u2019ll be watching and the world will be watching,\u201d Psaki said. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine will push over 40 million people into extreme poverty through price spikes for food and energy, according to the Center for Global Development. In an analysis blog, the Washington-based thinktank said food commodity prices since the start of the conflict have risen above levels experienced in price spikes in 2007 and 2010. It cited World Bank Research showing that the 2007 spike may have pushed as many as 155 million people into extreme poverty, and separate research showing the 2010 episode pushed 44 million into extreme poverty. The researchers said the most immediate concern was for direct wheat customers of Ukraine and Russia, which together account for more than a quarter of world wheat exports. These include Egypt, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Azerbaijan and Turkey, but prices will rise worldwide as importers compete for alternative supplies. The Biden administration has given a briefing on the Biden-Xi call, not adding too much detail, but stressing the price China would pay for arming Russia. A senior administration official said there would be consequences \u201cnot just for China\u2019s relationship with the United States, but for the wider world\u201d, but would not give more details on whether Biden had gone into specifics on possible sanctions, other than to point out what had happened to Russia as an example. \u201cThe president really laid out in a lot of detail the unified response from not only governments around the world, but also the private sector, to Russia\u2019s brutal aggression in Ukraine,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe president made clear that there would likely be consequences for those who would step in to support Russia at this time.\u201d \u201cThis was really about President Biden being able to lay out very clearly in substantial detail, with a lot of facts, really walking President Xi through the situation, making very, very clear our views,\u201d the official added, but said Biden did not make any direct requests to Xi to persuade Putin to end the onslaught. \u201cThe president really wasn\u2019t making specific requests of China. He was laying out his assessment of the situation and the implications of certain actions. Our view is that China will make its own decisions.\u201d Reports are emerging that the crowd which witnessed Vladimir Putin\u2019s speech in Moscow earlier today may not have been there entirely voluntarily. Russian TV footage showed a boisterous crowd at the Luzhniki stadium, attendees waving flags and cheering ahead of a speech where Putin hailed Russian \u201cunity\u201d. But BBC journalist Will Vernon reported that at least some of the crowd had been \u201cforced\u201d to attend. During the speech \u2013 which Russian state TV cut off in an apparent glitch \u2013 Putin repeated his unfounded claims that Ukraine was committing genocide in the Donbas region. The US has \u201cseen a number of missteps\u201d by Russia in its invasion of Ukraine, the US defense secretary said on Friday. In an interview with CNN Lloyd Austin said Russian troops \u201chave not progressed as far as quickly as they would have liked\u201d, adding that Russian forces have \u201cstruggled with logistics\u201d. Austin told CNN he has not seen evidence of \u201cgood employment of tactical intelligence\u201d or \u201cintegration of air capability with a ground maneuver.\u201d \u201cThere are a number of things that we would expect to have seen that we just haven\u2019t seen,\u201d Austin said. \u201cMany of their assumptions have not proven to be true as they entered this fight.\u201d \u201cI think [Russia] envisioned that they would move rapidly and very quickly seize the capital city, they\u2019ve not been able to do that,\u201d the Pentagon chief added. This is Adam Gabbatt taking over from L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong. It is 9pm in Kyiv. Here\u2019s where things stand now: Fighting has reached the centre of the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol, where 350,000 civilians have been stranded with little food or water.

The US president, Joe Biden, described to China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, in a phone call today \u201cimplications and consequences\u201d if Beijing provides material support to Russia as it attacks Ukrainian cities and civilians, the White House said. In a statement, the White House said the phone call between the Chinese and American leaders, which lasted nearly two hours, focused on Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. President Biden outlined the views of the United States and our Allies and partners on this crisis. President Biden detailed our efforts to prevent and then respond to the invasion, including by imposing costs on Russia. He described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians. The President underscored his support for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis. An earlier statement from the Chinese foreign ministry quoted Xi as telling Biden that conflicts and confrontations were in no-one\u2019s interests. According to the ministry, Xi said: The top priorities now are to continue dialogue and negotiations, avoid civilian casualties, prevent a humanitarian crisis, cease fighting and end the war as soon as possible. Chinese state media quoted Xi saying in the call: The Ukraine crisis is something that we don\u2019t want to see. The former UK prime minister, David Cameron, is driving a small lorry full of supplies for Ukrainian refugees to the country\u2019s border with Poland. Cameron announced the trip on Twitter, where he said he had been volunteering for two years at a food project in west Oxfordshire called the Chippy Larder. The Greek government has announced it is \u201cready to rebuild\u201d the maternity hospital bombed in Mariupol on March 9th, Helena Smith reports. Announcing the plan, the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, referred to the besieged city\u2019s connection with expatriate Greeks, a 120,000-strong community who have lived and worked there for centuries. The centre-right leader tweeted: Greece is ready to rebuild the maternity hospital in Mariupol, the centre of the Greek minority in Ukraine, a city dear to our hearts and symbol of the barbarity of the war. Russia\u2019s shelling of the hospital shocked the world as images of a heavily pregnant woman being rushed to an ambulance on a stretcher from the bombed building emerged. Russian officials claimed the maternity hospital had been taken over by Ukrainian extremists using it as a base and that at the time of the attack neither patients nor medics were inside. Moscow\u2019s ambassador to the UN and the Russian embassy in London described the images as \u201cfake news\u201d. Both the woman and her baby died less than a week later, according to the Associated Press. Russian forces first encircled the strategic port city on March 2nd, subjecting it to constant bombardment ever since with an estimated 400,000 people who have remained in Mariupol having no access to water, food or medicines. Heat and phone services have also been cut. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Ukrainian president and a member of the negotiating team, has accused Russian statements on peace talks of attempting \u201cto provoke tension in the media\u201d. \u201cOur positions are unchanged,\u201d he tweeted today. \u201cCeasefire, withdrawal of troops &amp; strong security guarantees with concrete formulas.\u201d Podolyak\u2019s comments come after a member of Russia\u2019s negotiating team, Vladimir Medinsky, said Moscow and Kyiv are most aligned on Ukraine\u2019s neutrality and giving up on joining Nato. Medinsky said Moscow and Kyiv are \u201chalfway there\u201d in agreeing on the issue of Ukraine\u2019s demilitarisation, adding that both sides were discussing nuances of security guarantees should Ukraine no longer attempt to join the Nato alliance, the Interfax news agency reported. Residents of Ukraine\u2019s besieged city of Mariupol have resorted to escaping on foot as official evacuation efforts have mostly failed due to ongoing shelling by Russian forces, the region\u2019s governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said. Speaking on national television, Kyrylenko said around 35,000 had managed to leave the city in recent days, many leaving on foot or in convoys of private cars, Reuters reports. The way out of blockaded Mariupol begins with residents getting out either on foot or in their own transport. Some cars that were leaving Mariupol did not have enough fuel to reach the nearest villages or towns, he said. Near-constant shelling by Russian forces was preventing authorities from opening humanitarian corridors to supply aid and food to the city and to evacuate women, children and those most in need, Kyrylenko said. Read our latest report on the situation in Mariupol: Six and a half million people are currently displaced within Ukraine, the UN has said today, nearly twice as many as have managed to flee the country, Lizzy Davies reports. The new figure, which dwarfs the 3.3 million refugees who have entered mainly EU territory, is a big jump on the UN\u2019s last estimate of 1.85 million. The International Organisation for Migration, which conducted a survey between 9 and 16 March to get a better idea of the scale of the problem, calculated the number of IDPs at 6.48 million. Aid workers told the Guardian at the weekend they were only able to get a fraction of what was needed to vulnerable people on the move. On Friday the International Displacement Monitoring Centre at the Norwegian Refugee Council said: Most IDPs are sheltering with family or in private accommodation in basements or underground car garages. Air raid shelters and metro stations are also a place of refuge. A growing number are moving to collective shelters - public buildings such as schools, churches, gyms and concert halls - where, in addition to overcrowded conditions, they face limited water and electricity and a lack of gender separation, greatly increasing the risk of gender-based violence, Covid-19 transmission and other infectious disease outbreaks. The UN protection cluster said a major reason for the enormous spike in estimates was that IOM\u2019s survey had access to people from eastern and northern regions \u201cclose to areas under active hostilities\u201d which turned out to host large numbers of IDPs displaced within cities or the same oblasts. In the previous week, few reliable data sources from the latter regions were available... so the previous methodology considered mostly data sources reported in the Western and Central areas of the country. IOM\u2019s assessment therefore provides a more comprehensive overview of the displacement situation. Fighting has reached the centre of the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol, according to reports. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko told the BBC: Yes, they were really active today. Tanks and machine gun battles continue. Everybody is hiding in bunkers. More than 80% of residential buildings in Mariupol are either damaged or destroyed, he added, and 30% of them cannot be restored. There\u2019s no city centre left. There isn\u2019t a small piece of land in the city that doesn\u2019t have signs of war. Earlier today, the Russian defence ministry said Russian forces were \u201ctightening the noose\u201d around the city of Mariupol, adding that fighting was ongoing in the city centre. In a one-hour call between the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, today, Macron said he was \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about the situation in Mariupol, the French presidential office said. It is almost 7.30pm in Kyiv. Here\u2019s where we stand now: Russian missiles struck an aircraft repair plant in Ukraine\u2019s western city of Lviv, 50 miles from the border with Poland and a safe haven for hundreds of thousands of internally displaced Ukrainians. Blasts were heard at about 6am on Friday, preceded by the sound of air raid sirens, as a mushroom-shaped plume of smoke could be seen rising in the sky. Russia\u2019s bombardment in the east of Ukraine continued on Friday. In the streets of Mariupol, where 350,000 civilians have been stranded with little food or water, Russia\u2019s armed forces were \u201ctightening the noose\u201d around the city, a spokesperson for the Russian defence ministry said. In the eastern city of Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s state emergency service said a multi-storey teaching building had been shelled on Friday morning, killing one person, wounding 11 and trapping one other in the rubble. Shells were also said to have struck the eastern city of Kramatorsk, killing two people and wounding six. In the northern part of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, one person was killed and four others wounded after parts of a Russian missile fell on a residential building. Hundreds of people remain buried under the rubble of a theatre in the devastated city of Mariupol that was hit by a Russian airstrike on Wednesday, Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. In his latest video address, Zelenskiy said that more than 130 people have been rescued so far but officials have said rescue efforts had been hindered by the complete breakdown of social services in the city and fears of future Russian attacks. Kyiv city administration said today that 222 people have been killed in the Ukrainian capital since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, including 60 civilians and four children. In a statement, it said a further 889 people have been wounded, including 241 civilians and 18 children, in the capital. The Guardian has not been able to verify these figures. Russian forces are \u201cholding captive\u201d a Ukrainian journalist, Victoria Roshchyna, according to the Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske. In a statement, Hromadske said they believe Roshchyna was detained by the Russian FSB around 15 March. Chinese president Xi Jinping told his US counterpart Joe Biden on Friday that conflicts and confrontations such as the events unfolding in Ukraine are in no one\u2019s interests, according to Chinese state media. \u201cThe Ukraine crisis is something that we don\u2019t want to see,\u201d Xi was quoted by Chinese media as saying to the US president. Vladimir Putin praised Russian \u201cunity\u201d over what the Kremlin is calling its special operation in Ukraine during a rare public speech at the national stadium in Moscow. As Putin was finishing his speech, the broadcast was suddenly cut off and state television showed patriotic songs. The Kremlin\u2019s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov blamed a \u201ctechnical failure\u201d for the cutoff. A World Food Programme (WFP) official said on Friday that food supply chains in Ukraine were collapsing, with a portion of infrastructure destroyed and many grocery stores and warehouses now empty. Jakob Kern, WFP emergency coordinator for the Ukraine crisis, also expressed concern about the situation in \u201cencircled cities\u201d such as Mariupol, saying supplies were running out and its convoys had not yet been able to enter the city. Pope Francis has denounced the \u201cperverse abuse of power\u201d on display in Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and called for aid to Ukrainians, whom he said had been attacked in their \u201cidentity, history and tradition\u201d and were \u201cdefending their land\u201d. Francis\u2019s comments were some of his strongest yet in asserting Ukraine\u2019s right to exist as a sovereign state and to defend itself against Russia\u2019s invasion. Hello everyone. I\u2019m L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong and I\u2019ll continue to bring you all the latest developments on the war in Ukraine today. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Russian forces are \u201cholding captive\u201d a Ukrainian journalist, according to the Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske. In a statement, Hromadske said they believe their journalist, Victoria Roshchyna, was detained by the Russian FSB around 15 March. Our journalist Victoria Roshchyna is held captive by the Russian occupiers. She was reporting from hotspots in Eastern and Southern Ukraine since the beginning of the Russian-Ukrainian war. On March 12, we couldn\u2019t contact Victoria As we learned from witnesses, at that time the journalist was in the temporarily occupied Berdiansk. On March 16, we learned that the day before (probably March 15), Victoria Roshchyna was detained by the Russian FSB. Currently, we do not know where she is We call on the Ukrainian and international community to help us to find and release Victoria Roshchyna, Hromadske journalist A member of Russia\u2019s negotiating team in talks with Ukraine, Vladimir Medinsky, said Moscow and Kyiv are most aligned on Ukraine\u2019s neutrality and giving up on joining Nato, the Interfax news agency reports. Medinsky said Moscow and Kyiv are \u201chalfway there\u201d in agreeing on the issue of Ukraine\u2019s demilitarisation, adding that both sides were discussing nuances of security guarantees should Ukraine no longer attempt to join the Nato alliance. He declined to reveal any other details of the talks. Meanwhile, Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser and negotiator in the talks, told so-called \u201cexperts\u201d to \u201ctake a break\u201d from commenting on how to wage war against and negotiate with Russia. Footage has emerged from the devastated Ukrainian city of Mariupol showing a shopping centre in the south-eastern port in ruins as residents continue to be bombarded by Russian airstrikes. There is no evidence to suggest that Vladimir Putin\u2019s overall intent in Ukraine has changed despite the invasion failing to reach its original objectives, a Western official said. Reuters cites the official speaking on condition of anonymity: I\u2019ve seen nothing which suggests that the original intent of Putin has significantly altered. Therefore ... the difference between what was planned, what is being executed is at the moment one of timing, and they have failed to achieve their objectives in the time that they set out in their original objectives and their original plan. The official said Russian forces could sustain bombardments on Ukrainian cities by increasingly using unguided missiles. Their ability to use that sort of scale of artillery, whilst not infinite, is really, really significant. There is an enormous amount of artillery ammunition which the Russian forces hold, and it may be a logistical challenge for them to get all of it in place. But if they\u2019re able to bring those supplies forward, then they could mount that sort of artillery bombardment for a very, very considerable period of time. Many of the attendees at today\u2019s packed pro-war rally at Moscow\u2019s national stadium say they worked in the public sector and had been pressured into going by their employers, the BBC reports. From BBC News\u2019 Will Vernon: In his latest video address, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, vowed that the Russians will pay for the \u201cthousands of hearts stopped by this war\u201d in Ukraine. Zelenskiy accused Russian forces of \u201cdoing everything to prevent\u201d Ukrainian humanitarian cargo from entering the besieged city of Mariupol. More than 35,000 people have been rescued from Mariupol, he said. Meanwhile, more than 130 people have been rescued at the site of the bombing of a theatre where Mariupol residents hid from shelling, he said. Hundreds of people are still under the debris. Despite the shelling, despite all the difficulties, we will continue rescue work. Zelenskiy also vowed that Ukraine \u201cwill become a full member of the EU\u201d, adding that he had spoken with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, who had \u201cpromised to do everything to speed up Ukraine\u2019s accession to the EU\u201d. I am confident that by attacking us, they will destroy everything that Russian society has achieved over the past 25 years. And they will return to where they once began to rise from, as they say, to the \u201cthe wicked 90\u2019s\u201d. But without freedom. Pope Francis has denounced the \u201cperverse abuse of power\u201d on display in Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and called for aid to Ukrainians, whom he said had been attacked in their \u201cidentity, history and tradition\u201d and were \u201cdefending their land\u201d. Francis\u2019s comments, in a message to a gathering of European Catholic representatives on Friday, were some of his strongest yet in asserting Ukraine\u2019s right to exist as a sovereign state and to defend itself against Russia\u2019s invasion. They came only days after he told the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, that the concept of a \u201cjust war\u201d was obsolete since wars are never justifiable and that pastors must preach peace, not politics. Those comments, during a video call with Kirill on Wednesday, were an indirect criticism of the patriarch\u2019s apparent defence of the war. Kirill, who is close to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has seemingly justified the invasion by describing it as part of a struggle against sin and pressure from liberal foreigners to hold \u201cgay parades\u201d. He has blamed the west and a fellow Orthodox patriarch for fomenting enmity between Ukraine and Russia and echoed Putin in insisting they are \u201cone people\u201d. In his comments on Friday, Francis did not mention Russia by name \u2013 the Vatican traditionally does not identify aggressors and has attempted to maintain a dialogue with Kirill\u2019s church \u2013 but Francis strongly backed Ukraine. Francis told the meeting in Bratislava, Slovakia: The heartbreaking scream for help from our Ukrainian brothers pushes us as a community of believers not just to serious reflection, but to cry with them and work for them; to share the anguish of a people wounded in its identity, history and tradition. Russian state television suddenly cut away from Vladimir Putin speaking at an event marking the eighth anniversary of Crimea\u2019s annexation on Friday. The president was making a speech with his government in the packed Luzhniki stadium in Moscow when the TV started showing patriotic songs being played at the event instead. Russian president Vladimir Putin praised the country\u2019s \u201cunity\u201d during what Russia calls its \u201cspecial operation\u201d in Ukraine as he was giving a rare public speech at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on Friday, Pjotr Sauer reports. \u201cThe country hasn\u2019t seen unity like this in a long time,\u201d Putin said, addressing a massive flag-waving crowd. As Putin was finishing his speech, he was suddenly cut off and state television showed patriotic songs performed earlier in the day by popular Russian musician Oleg Gazmanov. Soon afterwards, Putin\u2019s speech, which took around 5 minutes, was rebroadcast from the start with the Russian leader ending his speech and walking off stage. The Kremlin\u2019s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told journalists shortly after the event that the cut off occurred due to a \u201ctechnical failure\u201d. One concertgoer told Reuters that Putin left the stage after his speech, with no interruptions taking place. The event officially marked the 8th anniversary of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, but many of the speeches were aimed at rallying the country behind the invasion of Ukraine. Moscow police said more than 200,000 people were in and around the Luzhniki Stadium, which hosted the 2018 Fifa World Cup final, and many were seen waving flags emblazoned with the symbol \u201cZ\u201d. The \u201cZ\u201d symbol has gone from a military marking to the main symbol of public support for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. During his speech, Putin sought to justify his country\u2019s actions by repeating his unfounded claims that Ukraine was committing \u201cgenocide\u201d in the Donbas region, \u201cThis really was genocide. Stopping that was the goal of the special operation,\u201d Putin said, adding that Ukranian civilians have welcomed Moscow\u2019s invading troops. The Russian leader also hailed the actions of the country\u2019s military fighting in Ukraine, by paraphrasing a Bible saying. There is no greater love than giving up one\u2019s soul for one\u2019s friends. On the run-up to the rally, Reuters and a number of other Russian outlets reported that state employees were ordered to attend the event. Russia has a long history of state employees being coerced to attend pro-government rallies. Putin\u2019s speech came as Russian troops continued to shell the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and also launched missiles on the outskirts of the western city of Lviv. Ukrainians fleeing the war can now stay in Canada for as long as three years on a special visa program, the government said this week, Leyland Cecco reports. Previously, Ukrainian nationals were told they could spend two years in Canada. The increase, announced this week, was meant to give Ukrainians the \u201cflexibility\u201d to stay longer if needed, a spokesperson for the immigration ministry said in a statement. Under the program, Ukrainians can leave and return to Canada any time while their visa is valid. To apply from overseas, they must provide biometric data and a photograph. Any Ukrainians already in Canada can apply to increase their stay to three years. All application fees have been waived by the government. While more than three million people have fled the Ukraine since the invasion by Russian troops, only 3,368 Ukrainians have arrived in Canada as of this week. Community groups in Canada have called for more support, including dropping all visa requirements for Ukrainian nationals, a move Canada\u2019s immigration minister said would take too long to be helpful. There are growing calls for the Canadian government to airlift Ukrainians, a move prime minister Justin Trudeau said could be possible. \u201cIf there is sufficient demand that requires us to do more like sending airlifts, we will look at that,\u201d he said this week. After 11 years of war, the destruction of towns, cities and much of the Syrian military, Bashar al-Assad\u2019s army has launched a recruitment drive. But the recruits are not fresh from bootcamps and will not fight on the home front. They are the vanguard of what could be the biggest state-backed mercenary force in the world. Within days, Syrian troops could be deployed to the stalled Russian frontlines in Ukraine, where Vladimir Putin is about to extract a lethal price for Moscow\u2019s rescue of the Syrian leader. The first Syrian troops to join Putin\u2019s ranks \u2013 an advance force of 150 \u2013 arrived in Russia on Thursday, European intelligence officials claim. Ukrainian military intelligence, echoing a claim by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, believes 40,000 Syrians have signed up to fight \u2013 a figure that would represent a sizeable chunk of the battle-ready capacity of the country\u2019s entire military. In the economic wasteland of post-war Syria, the best \u2013 and maybe only \u2013 state-backed job on offer is one that those who sign on for might not come home from. The vast majority of newly enlisted Syrian mercenaries are trading in salaries of $15 a month for monthly deals worth between $600 and $3,000. Rank and experience in the gruelling decade of insurrection attracts the higher dollars, but even the basic salary is luring recruits who have little way out of overwhelming poverty. Syrians have shown a readiness to sign up at least 14 recruitment centres across the country, in Aleppo, Damascus, Deir Azzour, Homs and Hama, as well as Raqqa, which less than five years ago was at the centre of the war against Islamic State. The Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has said his country stands ready to rebuild the bombed maternity hospital in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol. He tweeted: \u201cGreece is ready to rebuild the maternity hospital in Mariupol, the center of the Greek minority in Ukraine, a city dear to our hearts and symbol of the barbarity of the war.\u201d Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy condemned a Russian attack on the children\u2019s hospital as evidence of \u201cgenocide\u201d. \u201cA children\u2019s hospital, a maternity ward. How did they threaten the Russian Federation? What is this country, the Russian Federation, that is afraid of hospitals, maternity wards and is destroying them?\u201d said Zelenskiy on Telegram. Chinese president Xi Jinping told his US counterpart Joe Biden on Friday that conflicts and confrontations such as the events unfolding in Ukraine are in no one\u2019s interests, according to Chinese state media. State-to-state relations cannot advance to the stage of confrontation, and conflicts and confrontations are not in the interests of anyone, Xi told Biden on a video call. \u201cThe Ukraine crisis is something that we don\u2019t want to see,\u201d said Xi. Xi said China and the US must guide bilateral relations along the right track, and both sides should also shoulder due international responsibilities and make efforts for world peace, Reuters reported. Amateur hackers are being warned off joining Ukraine\u2019s \u201cIT army\u201d by western officials, amid fears that activists could be breaking the law or launch attacks that spiral out control. Ukraine\u2019s cyber-response to the Russian invasion has been bolstered by hackers organising on the Telegram messaging app under the IT Army of Ukraine banner. More than 300,000 people have signed up to the group, including members from outside Ukraine. Western officials said they would \u201cstrongly discourage\u201d joining the group and taking part in hacking activity against Russia.\u201d \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t encourage criminality in any way, shape or form,\u201d said one official on Thursday. \u201cWe would strongly discourage people from looking to get involved in those kinds of activities.\u201d Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Friday said rescue work was ongoing at the site of a bombed theatre in Mariupol from where 130 people have so far been recovered alive. In an online address, Zelenskiy also said shelling by Russian forces continued to prevent the authorities from establishing effective humanitarian corridors to the encircled port city in southern Ukraine. Ukraine\u2019s human rights ombudswoman, Lyudmyla Denisova, said earlier that 1,300 people are still in the basement of the Regional Drama Theatre in Mariupol. So far 130 people have been rescued from the rubble after the building was hit by a Russian airstrike on Wednesday. Authorities have not been able to provide a further update on figures released yesterday about how many people survived the attack on the theatre, where hundreds of civilians including children and older people were believed to have been sheltering. Differing accounts have emerged of the one hour telephone conversation held between Germany\u2019s chancellor Olaf Scholz and Vladimir Putin on Friday morning. According to Scholz\u2019s office the German leader used the meeting to \u201cput pressure\u201d on the Russian president to enforce a ceasefire in Ukraine, according to a spokesperson in Berlin. Scholz had \u201cput pressure on [Putin] to introduce a ceasefire as soon as possible, to improve the humanitarian situation and to make progress in the search for a diplomatic solution for the conflict,\u201d the spokesman said. Giving no further details as to whether progress had been made, he added that the conversation had been focused on the war and attempts to stop it. In the Kremlin\u2019s version of the conversation, put out ahead of the statement from Berlin, it was described as \u201charsh but businesslike\u201d, with Putin complaining about war crimes he said had been committed by the Ukrainian Army, referring to attacks he said had taken place in the eastern cities of Donetsk and Makiivka which had led to \u201cnumerous deaths\u201d. \u201cThese war crimes are being ignored by the west,\u201d Putin said according to Russian news agency reports referring to the Kremlin. Putin reportedly told Scholz the Russian Army \u201cis doing everything to avoid civilian victims\u201d. According to the Kremlin\u2019s account, Putin accused Ukraine of trying to \u201cslow down\u201d the discussions with Russia, and said that the government in Kiev was making \u201cunrealistic suggestions\u201d. It added that the Russian leadership was \u201cready to seek solutions appropriate to its basic views\u201d. Scholz came in for stiff criticism on Thursday after his government rejected requests from opposition figures to discuss the situation in Ukraine, following an emotional speech given to the Bundestag by Volodymyr Zelenskiy. In his 11 minute address via video link, the Ukrainian president accused Germany of having paved the way for Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, through its strict adherence over years to its business dealings with Russia, especially related to the Baltic Sea gas pipelines. He appealed to Germans\u2019 sense of historical responsibility as he urged the government to do all it could to stop the war. On Friday Zelenskiy\u2019s foreign policy adviser, Mychailo Podoliak accused Scholz of \u201cplaying down\u201d the war by repeatedly insisting the conflict was best described as \u201cPutin\u2019s War\u201d, not \u201cRussia\u2019s War\u201d, as it was Putin who had wanted it, not the Russian people. Podliak said that the distinction was wrong, with opinion polls showing that a majority of the Russian populace was in favour of the war and by extension, of the killing of Ukrainians, he said. A live broadcast of President Vladimir Putin speaking at a packed stadium in Moscow suddenly cut to images of patriotic songs being played at the event. Russian state television cut away from Putin as he was speaking at Moscow\u2019s Luzhniki stadium to mark the eighth anniversary of Crimea\u2019s annexation. Addressing thousands of people waving Russian flags, Putin hailed what Russia calls its special operation in Ukraine. One concert-goer said that Putin had finished his speech and left the stage, Reuters reports. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the sudden interruption to the feed was due to a \u201ctechnical failure on the server\u201d, Russian state-owned news agency RIA reported. A call between the US president, Joe Biden, and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, began at 9.03am Eastern Time (1.03pm GMT), the White House said. The two leaders\u2019 first phone call since a video summit in November will be a chance to air differences as the US spearheads an unprecedented pressure campaign on Russia, placing China in a geopolitical bind. Biden is expected to warn Xi that he will face \u201ccosts\u201d if Beijing rescues fellow authoritarian ally Russia from intense western sanctions aimed at punishing Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Dozens of Ukrainian soldiers were killed when a Russian missile strike targeted a military base in Mykolaiv this morning, according to reports. The UN rights office (OHCHR) said at least 816 civilians had been killed and 1,333 wounded in Ukraine since the conflict began on 24 February, Reuters reports. The real death toll is likely to be considerable higher. The OHCHR, which has a large monitoring team in the country, has not yet been able to verify casualty reports from badly hit cities such as Mariupol. Most of the casualties were from explosive weapons such as shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and airstrikes, it said. Video shows damaged buildings \u2013 including a kindergarten \u2013 and infrastructure in the small city in the Sumy region after it was bombarded by Russia. As war continues in Ukraine, so too does the battle over information. In Bangkok on Friday, Ukraine\u2019s embassy charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires Oleksandr Lysak described comments made to the media by the Russian ambassador as \u201cabsolute nonsense\u201d, Rebecca Ratcliffe reports. Lysak addressed journalists just days after the Russian embassy in Bangkok held an event for Thai media, where the war was described as a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d. The Russian ambassador to Thailand, Evgeny Tomikhin, reportedly claimed that Russia did not shell civilian buildings, and that its objective was the \u201cdenazification\u201d of Ukraine, according to a report by Khaosod English. Foreign media were not permitted to attend the event. Lysak said on Friday: We try to actually explain to people that this is Russian propaganda. These statements are fake. They destroy our schools, our hospitals and our facilities.\u201d The response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has been muted across much of south-east Asia. Thailand voted in favour of a UN resolution condemning Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, but has otherwise maintained a neutral stance. The war has provoked a mixed reaction within Thailand. While some conservatives have expressed support for Russia, other, often younger, Thais have said they are prepared to fight alongside Ukrainians. None have yet travelled to the country, according to Lysak. He added that he longed to see his own family, who remain in Kyiv. \u201cI\u2019m feeling pain, I\u2019m feeling very anxious,\u201d he said. Actually I just pray to God to stop this war as soon as possible.\u201d One hundred and nine empty strollers were placed in the main square in Lviv in memory of the 109 Ukrainian children killed since the beginning of the Russian invasion. Lviv\u2019s mayor, Andriy Sadovyi, said: We call on all adults around the world to stand as one shield to protect Ukrainian children and give them future. Urge the governments of other countries to close the sky over Ukraine. Ukraine will not abandon its bid to join the EU to reach a compromise with Russia as part of an agreement to end the war, President Zelenskiy\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Andrii Sybiha, said today. Speaking on national television, Sybiha said: I will be categorical, this is absolutely unacceptable. It is our choice, the application for EU membership has been submitted and now it is being put into practice. Negotiations with Russia were ongoing but difficult, he added. Two hundred and 22 people have been killed in the Ukrainian capital since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, including 60 civilians and four children, according to local officials. In a statement, the Kyiv city administration said a further 889 people have been wounded, including 241 civilians and 18 children, in the capital, Reuters reports. In addition, 757 children have been born in Kyiv since the start of the war, it said. The Guardian has not been able to verify these figures. A pro-Kremlin rally to mark the eighth anniversary of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea is taking place today at the Luzhniki stadium in Moscow. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, says he has spoken with the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, as part of regular talks, adding that he was grateful for Britain\u2019s \u201cstrong support\u201d. The number of people fleeing the war in Ukraine has slowed in recent days, according to a UN refugee agency official. Daily border crossings from Ukraine into Poland, the country that has received the most arrivals, have fallen by around half from a peak of about 100,000 daily, Reuters quoted Matthew Saltmarsh as saying. However, more of the refugees crossing into Poland in recent days have been showing signs of having suffered trauma than those who fled earlier in the crisis. Speaking from Poland, Saltmarsh said: Many of them don\u2019t have a plan. Those who arrive are not clear where they can go. Figures could rise again if the fighting spreads further west, he added, as many people fled besieged cities in the country\u2019s east to the western city of Lviv. If indeed there is an escalation in Lviv, there is a danger there will be renewed movements towards the border. Overall, UN agencies say 3.27 million people have fled Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February and an additional 2 million people have been displaced internally. Ukraine\u2019s human rights ombudswoman, Lyudmyla Denisova, said 130 people had been rescued so far from the rubble of a theatre in the devastated city of Mariupol that was hit by a Russian airstrike on Wednesday. Authorities have not been able to provide a further update on figures released yesterday about how many people survived the attack on the theatre, where hundreds of civilians including children and older people were believed to have been sheltering. In a televised address, Denisova said rescue work was ongoing at the site. We are praying for them to be alive, but as of now we don\u2019t have any information. According to a translation by NBC News, Denisova said 1,300 people are still in the basement of the Regional Drama Theatre in Mariupol. I emphasised that 130 people have already been evacuated from the drama theater in Mariupol destroyed by the occupiers, but 1,300 people are still in the basements. Donetsk regional head Pavlo Kyrylenko said he would not be commenting until he had received official reports. Yesterday, the former Donetsk region head, Serhiy Taruta, said he believed 1,300 people were in the building when it was bombed and 130 had been rescued so far. Speaking in an interview on Ukrainian television Thursday afternoon, Taruta said rescue efforts had been hindered by the complete breakdown of social services in the city and fears of future Russian attacks. Taruta said: People are doing everything themselves. My friends went to help, but due to constant shelling it was not safe. People are clearing away the rubble themselves. There is no rescue operation, because all the services that are supposed to rescue people, to treat them, to bury them, these services no longer exist. At least as recently as Monday, large white letters on the ground in front of and behind the theatre spelled out \u201cdeti\u201d \u2013 \u201cchildren\u201d in Russian \u2013 to alert warplanes of those inside, according to images from the Maxar space technology company. Russia has denied bombing the theatre. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, says he has spoken with the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, about a further package of EU sanctions against Russia over the war in Ukraine. The European bloc approved a fourth round of sanctions earlier this week, which included bans on Russian energy sector investments, luxury goods exports to Moscow and imports of steel products from Russia. The sanctions, launched on Tuesday, also froze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state, including the Chelsea football club owner, Roman Abramovich, and the head of Russian state TV Channel One, Konstantin Ernst, who were added to a blacklist that already includes dozens of wealthy Russians. The latest barrage of sanctions followed three rounds of measures that included freezing the assets of the Russian central bank, the exclusion from the Swift banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks, and the freezing of assets of oligarchs and politicians including Vladimir Putin and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. Hello, I\u2019m L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong and I\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest developments on the war in Ukraine. Don\u2019t hesitate to get in touch on Twitter or via email if you have anything to flag you think we should be covering. The time in Kyiv is 1pm. Here is a roundup of the day\u2019s main headlines so far: A World Food Programme (WFP) official said on Friday that food supply chains in Ukraine were collapsing, with a portion of infrastructure destroyed and many grocery stores and warehouses now empty. US president Joe Biden is set to speak with his Chinese counterpart at 1pm GMT today, where he is expected to warn Xi Jinping he will face \u201ccosts\u201d if Beijing rescues fellow authoritarian ally Russia from intense western sanctions aimed at punishing Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. A Russian missile attack near Lviv airport has raised fears of Vladimir Putin\u2019s war spreading to western Ukraine, as Russia claimed to be \u201ctightening the noose\u201d around the south-eastern port city of Mariupol. The Ukrainian air force says the aircraft repair plant in Lviv was struck by cruise missiles fired from the direction of the Black Sea. It also confirmed that two other Russian missiles were reportedly shot down by Ukrainian anti-aircraft defences before reaching their target. One person was killed and four others wounded after parts of a Russian missile fell on a residential building in the northern part of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Friday morning, emergencies services said. Britain\u2019s media regulator, Ofcom, has revoked Russian-backed television channel RT\u2019s licence to broadcast in the UK with immediate effect. The UK Ministry of Defence has just released its latest intelligence report on the situation in Ukraine, saying Russian forces have made \u201cminimal progress\u201d this week. Russia has established a no-fly zone over Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region, according to a separatist official from the self-proclaimed Donetsk republic, the Interfax news agency is reporting. The governor of Ukraine\u2019s eastern Luhansk region said frequent and widespread shelling by Russian forces was preventing the safe evacuation of civilians from towns and villages on the front line. The Ukrainian military has released its daily operational report as of 6am local time, claiming its forces destroyed 14 Russian air targets on Thursday. Emergency services are continuing to work to contain a blaze in one of the largest shopping centres in Kharkiv, according to officials. Ukraine\u2019s state emergency services said two rescuers suffered explosives injuries and were receiving medical treatment. However, one of the rescuers was reportedly unable to be saved and died from their injuries. French government spokesman Gabriel Attal said on Friday sanctions imposed by western countries on Russia in reaction to Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine were starting to have a \u201creal impact\u201d. That\u2019s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for now. My colleague L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the breaking news from Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. A Russian missile attack near Lviv airport has raised fears of Vladimir Putin\u2019s war spreading to western Ukraine, as Russia claimed to be \u201ctightening the noose\u201d around the south-eastern port city of Mariupol. A facility for repairing military aircraft by Lviv\u2019s international airport \u2013 only 43 miles from Poland\u2019s border \u2013 was hit by two cruise missiles fired from the Black Sea on Friday morning. Ukrainian officials said they had shot down a further four missiles launched in the attack, the second on facilities near the historic city in recent days. The strikes raise the spectre of Ukraine losing what has so far been a relative safe haven and hub for refugees and humanitarian aid. At least 35 people were killed and 134 wounded on Sunday after more than 30 Russian cruise missiles targeted a military facility outside Lviv and only 15 miles from Poland\u2019s border. A World Food Programme (WFP) official said on Friday that food supply chains in Ukraine were collapsing, with a portion of infrastructure destroyed and many grocery stores and warehouses now empty. Jakob Kern, WFP emergency coordinator for the Ukraine crisis, also expressed concern about the situation in \u201cencircled cities\u201d such as Mariupol, saying supplies were running out and its convoys had not yet been able to enter the city. Pope Francis on Friday called the war a \u201cperverse abuse of power\u201d waged for partisan interests that has condemned defenceless people to brutal violence. Since the war began, the pope has not used the word \u201cRussia\u201d in his condemnations but has used phrases such as \u201cunacceptable armed aggression\u201d to get his point across. His latest condemnation came in a message to a Catholic church conference in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia. The Ukrainian air force says the aircraft repair plant in Lviv was struck by cruise missiles fired from the direction of the Black Sea. It also confirmed that two other Russian missiles were reportedly shot down by Ukrainian anti-aircraft defences before reaching their target. The plant was not in operation at the time of the strike and so far casualties have been reported, Lviv city mayor Andriy Sadovy said. According to officials, the missiles \u2013 probably Kh-555 weapons launched from heavy strategic bombers \u2013 had not directly hit Danylo Halytskyi international airport of Lviv, where, before being closed after the invasion, passengers could fly to more than 50 international destinations, including Madrid, London, Paris, Milan, Venice, Catania and Barcelona. Russian president Vladimir Putin told German chancellor Olaf Scholz during a phone call on Friday that Kyiv was \u201cattempting to stall peace talks\u201d with Russia but that Moscow was still keen to continue negotiations. \u201cIt was noted that the Kyiv regime is attempting in every possible way to delay the negotiation process, putting forward more and more unrealistic proposals,\u201d the Kremlin said in a readout of the call. \u201cNonetheless the Russian side is ready to continue searching for a solution in line with its well-known principled approaches.\u201d Clouds of black smoke were seen rising on the horizon of Lviv on Friday morning. According to the city\u2019s mayor, Andriy Sadovy, several missiles hit an aircraft repair plant at the airport complex in the western Ukrainian city, destroying a building. He added that the plant had been stopped and there were no casualties from the strike. Even before Vladimir Putin declared a hunt for \u201cnational traitors\u201d and a \u201cfifth column\u201d over his invasion of Ukraine this week, anti-war activists had faced increasing pressure, including police torture, intimidation tactics, work dismissals and other threats. In a police station in Moscow earlier this month, an anti-war protester managed to record her own beating as officers threatened her for taking part in peaceful demonstrations in which nearly 15,000 people have been detained. \u201cPlace of study?\u201d a policeman asks the student in the recording, which she published online. When she didn\u2019t answer, they hit her. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a bit of a bruise. Get up, try to remember.\u201d Then they hit her again. In an interview with the Guardian, another student, Anastasia, 18, described being threatened for hours after being arrested for taking to the streets and chanting \u201cNo to war.\u201d \u201cThey told me they would beat me and that they were going to throw us to the homeless, rape us,\u201d she said. She added she had not been beaten but that officers grew violent with other activists as they refused to cooperate. \u201cI think they would have said anything to get me to sign [the court order] \u2026 just not to have to deal with us.\u201d Russia\u2019s war has above all affected the lives of millions of Ukrainians, turning busy cities such as Mariupol and Kharkiv into war-scarred battlegrounds and leaving thousands dead. But Russians have also woken up in a different country, one seeking internal enemies to blame for the country\u2019s descent into economic isolation and hardship. The governor of Ukraine\u2019s eastern Luhansk region said frequent and widespread shelling by Russian forces was preventing the safe evacuation of civilians from towns and villages on the front line. Russia has denied targeting civilians since the start of its invasion of Ukraine, which it calls a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to disarm and \u201cdenazify\u201d its southern neighbour, a democratic country of 44 million people, Reuters reported. Luhansk governor Serhiy Gaidai said 59 civilians had been killed in the region since the start of the war, which he said had entirely destroyed some residential areas. \u201cThere is not one community that hasn\u2019t been under fire,\u201d he said on national television, naming the towns of Severodonetsk, Rubizhne and Popasna as particular hotspots. Efforts to evacuate civilians have been hampered by the fighting, but the local authorities hope a temporary ceasefire can be agreed for Saturday to allow trucks to distribute food, medicine and other aid to people most in need. Here is some more from the Press Association on RT having its broadcasting licence revoked in the UK. The news agency reports: Ofcom has revoked Kremlin-backed broadcaster RT\u2019s UK licence with immediate effect. The TV watchdog said RT\u2019s licensee, ANO TV Novosti, is \u201cnot fit and proper\u201d to hold a licence amid 29 ongoing investigations into the \u201cdue impartiality\u201d of its programmes. A statement released by the regulator on Friday said: \u201cWe consider the volume and potentially serious nature of the issues raised within such a short period to be of great concern \u2013 especially given RT\u2019s compliance history, which has seen the channel fined \u00a3200,000 for previous due impartiality breaches. \u201cIn this context, we launched a separate investigation to determine whether ANO TV Novosti is fit and proper to retain its licence to broadcast.\u201d Ofcom said the decision to suspend the licence came amid ongoing investigations into RT\u2019s news and current affairs coverage of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, with prime minister Boris Johnson also having previously called for an Ofcom review. RT is currently off air in the UK due to sanctions imposed. Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes said: Freedom of expression is something we guard fiercely in this country, and the bar for action on broadcasters is rightly set very high. Following an independent regulatory process, we have today found that RT is not fit and proper to hold a licence in the UK. As a result we have revoked RT\u2019s UK broadcasting licence. The RT news website is currently still up and running. The former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has told the Russian people they were being fed misinformation about their country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and appealed to Vladimir Putin to end the war. In a video posted on Twitter, the Hollywood star said the Kremlin was intentionally lying to Russians by saying the invasion was intended to \u201cdenazify\u201d Ukraine. \u201cUkraine did not start this war, neither did nationalists or Nazis,\u201d he said, noting that the country\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is Jewish. Britain\u2019s media regulator, Ofcom, has revoked Russian-backed television channel RT\u2019s licence to broadcast in the UK with immediate effect. \u201cWe do not consider RT to be fit and proper to hold a UK licence and cannot be satisfied that it can be a responsible broadcaster,\u201d Ofcom said on Friday on Twitter. More to follow on this shortly. French government spokesman Gabriel Attal said on Friday sanctions imposed by western countries on Russia in reaction to Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine were starting to have a \u201creal impact\u201d. \u201cWe hope these sanctions will force [Russian president] Vladimir Putin to change his plans,\u201d Attal told BFM TV. Earlier this week, European Union member states agreed on a fourth package of sanctions against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reported. One person was killed and four others wounded after parts of a Russian missile fell on a residential building in the northern part of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Friday morning, emergencies services said. The services said in a statement that 12 people were rescued and 98 were evacuated from the five-storey building, Reuters reported. I\u2019m Tom Ambrose and will be bringing you the latest news as it happens over the next three hours. Before I hand over to my colleague Tom Ambrose, here is a quick recap of where things stand: For a more detailed summary, please see our earlier update here. The UK Ministry of Defence has just released its latest intelligence report on the situation in Ukraine, saying Russian forces have made \u201cminimal progress\u201d this week. According to Lviv\u2019s mayor, Andriy Sadovy, several missiles hit an aircraft repair plant earlier this morning, destroying a building. The plant had been stopped and there were no casualties from the strike, he said in an update posted to his Telegram account this morning. At least three blasts were heard shortly after 6am with air raid sirens sounding across the city. Russia has established a no-fly zone over Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region, according to a separatist official from the self-proclaimed Donetsk republic, the Interfax news agency is reporting. The Ukrainian military has released its daily operational report as of 6am local time, claiming its forces destroyed 14 Russian air targets on Thursday. Emergency services are continuing to work to contain a blaze in one of the largest shopping centres in Kharkiv, according to officials. Ukraine\u2019s state emergency services said two rescuers suffered explosive injuries and were receiving medical treatment. However, one of the rescuers was reportedly unable to be saved and died from their injuries. US president Joe Biden is set to speak with his Chinese counterpart at 1pm GMT today, where he is expected to warn Xi Jinping he will face \u201ccosts\u201d if Beijing rescues fellow authoritarian ally Russia from intense western sanctions aimed at punishing Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The UK Ministry of Defence has just released its latest intelligence report on the situation in Ukraine, saying Russian forces have made \u201cminimal progress\u201d this week. The report reads: Russian forces have made minimal progress this week. Ukrainian forces around Kyiv and Mykolaiv continue to frustrate Russian attempts to encircle the cities. The cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol remain encircled and subject to heavy Russian shelling. The UN now states that the number of refugees fleeing the conflict in Ukraine has already surpassed 3.2 million. This number will continue to rise as a result of ongoing Russian aggression.\u201d We have an update on the attack on Lviv from earlier this morning. According to the city\u2019s mayor, Andriy Sadovy, several missiles hit an aircraft repair plant, destroying a building. The plant had been stopped and there were no casualties from the strike, he said in an update posted to his Telegram account this morning. At least three blasts were heard shortly after 6am with air raid sirens sounding across the city. Russia has established a no-fly zone over Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region, according to a separatist official from the self-proclaimed Donetsk republic, the Interfax news agency is reporting. Meanwhile, Russian state media outlet Tass reports that the no-fly zone in the south of the country has been extended until 26 March, citing a source in the ministry of transport. \u201cThe Krasnodar airport confirmed the extension of the closure of airports in southern Russia until 3.45am Moscow time on 26 March,\u201d Tass reported. Here is an interesting take on how war has split Ukrainian-Russian families from Guardian reporter Lorenzo Tondo in Lviv. As Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine enters its fourth week, an information war between people on both sides of the border is intensifying. The military onslaught is not just demolishing residential buildings and city centres in Ukraine; it is sorely testing myriad familial cross-border ties that have endured for decades, centuries even. While people in Ukraine can see with their own eyes what is happening to their country, people in Russia do so only through the house of mirrors that is state television, and when those cowering in bunkers send videos and messages about their plight, many (but not all) of the recipients simply dismiss it as fake news. Read the full story below. Lviv\u2019s mayor has confirmed the blasts heard earlier this morning hit the area near the city\u2019s airport but did not hit the airport itself. In an update posted to his official Telegram account just before 8am local time, Andriy Sadovy said Russian missiles hit the area near Lviv airport. I can\u2019t say the address in real time yet, but it\u2019s definitely not an airport,\u201d he said. Sadovy said the situation was still being clarified and urged people not to share photos from the scene. The Ukrainian military has released its daily operational report as of 6am local time, claiming its forces destroyed 14 Russian air targets on Thursday. These reportedly included seven aircrafts, one helicopter, three UAV drones and three wing missiles. \u201cIn certain temporarily occupied territories, Russian occupiers are trying to create a demonstrative positive image of themselves by distributing food items to civilian population,\u201d the Ukrainian defence ministry added. Officials also maintained that low morale within Russian troops led to an \u201cincrease in the number of cases of [desertion] and refusal of military personnel\u201d to participate in the war against Ukraine. The force earlier claimed Russia was taking up measures to \u201cmake up for the loss of personnel at the expense of foreigners\u201d while preparing for a possible attack on Kyiv. More photos of civilians fleeing Ukraine provide a powerful snapshot of the refugee crisis. According to UN estimates, more than 3 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded on 24 February. While tens of thousands of people continue to flee the country each day, a small but growing number are heading in the other direction. At first they were foreign volunteers, Ukrainian expatriate men heading to fight and people delivering aid. But increasingly, women are also heading back. Emergency services are currently working to contain a blaze in one of the largest shopping centres in Kharkiv, according to officials. Ukraine\u2019s state emergency services said they received a call reporting commercial pavilions had caught fire with two residential buildings partially damaged on Thursday. As a result of the shelling, two rescuers suffered explosive injuries and are currently receiving medical treatment, the agency said in an update this morning. However, one of the rescuers was reportedly unable to be saved and died from their injuries. Explosions are being reported in the western Ukrainian City of Lviv this morning, with those in the city claiming that the airport was hit by a Russian missile. Smoke was purportedly seen rising from near Lviv International Airport, according to multiple videos posted across social media. The airport sits about 6km (3.7 miles) from the city centre. At least three blasts were heard shortly after 6am with air raid sirens sounding across the city. Ukraine 24 television station published a short video over its Telegram channel in which a mushroom-shaped plume of smoke could be seen rising on the horizon. BBC news journalist, James Reynolds, also uploaded a photo of the city skyline where smoke could be seen coming from the west in the direction of the airport. On the topic of China, the Guardian\u2019s world affairs editor Julian Borger asks: will it side with Russia and divide the world? A potential tipping point in China\u2019s role in the world may be underway as it decides how far to go in backing Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. While China has abstained on United Nations security council resolutions on the invasion, it has sided with Moscow rhetorically, echoing Russian talking points blaming Nato, and recycling conspiracy theories, and the Biden administration believes it has already decided to bail Russia out economically. At a meeting in Rome on Monday between the US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and his Chinese counterpart, Yang Jiechi, the Chinese delegation stunned US officials by echoing debunked Russian claims that the US and Ukraine had been pursuing a secret biological weapons programme together. The Americans came away from Rome more pessimistic than ever about Beijing intentions. \u201cThere are lots of indications that the Chinese are doing more behind the scenes to support Russia, in every sector: financially, economically and militarily,\u201d one official said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s deeply troubling. If they continue on this path, it will be a decisive turning point that will likely lead to much deeper anxiety in Europe about China and a more profound schism between Washington and Beijing.\u201d Members of Congress have warned that if there is evidence of Chinese military aid to the Russian campaign in Ukraine, they will impose punitive economic measures. Corporate leaders are also likely to reassess their business with China, along with European governments. Read the full story below. US President Joe Biden is set to speak with his Chinese counterpart at 1pm GMT today, where he is expected to warn Xi Jinping he will face \u201ccosts\u201d if Beijing rescues fellow authoritarian ally Russia from intense western sanctions aimed at punishing Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The two leaders\u2019 first phone call since a video summit in November will be a chance to air differences as the United States spearheads an unprecedented pressure campaign on Russia, placing China in a geopolitical bind. It\u2019s \u201can opportunity for President Biden to assess where President Xi stands,\u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. It will be the first time the pair have spoken directly since Russia invaded Ukraine more than three weeks ago. Washington warned China was considering military support for Russia\u2019s war, a step that would dramatically widen the gulf between Beijing and Western governments. Beijing has refused to condemn Moscow and Washington fears the Chinese could switch to full financial and even military support for Russia, transforming an already explosive transatlantic standoff into a global dispute. Not only could Beijing potentially help Russia weather crippling pressure on its banks and currency, but western governments would also face a decision on whether to impose sanctions against China, likely prompting turmoil on world markets. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said Biden will make clear that China will bear responsibility for any actions it takes to support Russia\u2019s aggression, adding \u201cwe will not hesitate to impose costs\u201d during a news briefing in Washington. Blinken said China had a responsibility to use its influence with Putin and to defend international rules, but that it appeared Beijing was \u201cmoving in the opposite direction\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned that they\u2019re considering directly assisting Russia with military equipment to use in Ukraine,\u201d he said, officially confirming for the first time reports earlier in the week that US officials believed China had signalled its willingness to provide Moscow with such support. Blinken did not elaborate on what the costs might be to China, and Washington has not yet offered evidence of the claim that China has signalled a willingness to help Russia. Moscow has denied asking China for military assistance, and China\u2019s foreign ministry has called the idea \u201cdisinformation\u201d. Hello it\u2019s Samantha Lock with you to report all the latest developments unfolding in Ukraine. Here is a recap of where the crisis currently stands: US president Joe Biden labelled Vladimir Putin \u201ca murderous dictator,\u201d and \u201ca pure thug\u201d during an address for St Patrick\u2019s day. Biden will speak with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at 9am Eastern time (1300 GMT) on Friday to discuss Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine \u201cand other issues of mutual concern\u201d the White House said. Meanwhile, a Chinese foreign ministry official met with Russia\u2019s ambassador to China on Thursday to exchange views on bilateral relations, the Chinese foreign ministry said. The World Health Organization said it has so far verified 43 attacks on health care, with 12 people killed and 34 injured, including health workers in Ukraine. The agency said the war is having \u201cdevastating consequences for the health of Ukraine\u2019s people; consequences that will reverberate for years or decades to come\u201d during remarks made at the United Nations security council meeting on Thursday. Russia is being forced to divert \u201clarge numbers\u201d of troops to defend its supply lines rather than continuing its attacks in Ukraine, British defence intelligence analysts believe. The UK Ministry of Defence\u2019s latest intelligence report says logistical problems continue to beset Russia\u2019s troops. The Ukrainian military claims Russia is taking up measures to \u201cmake up for the loss of personnel at the expense of foreigners\u201d while preparing for a possible attack on Kyiv. A Russian editor who protested against Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine during a state TV news broadcast says she is quitting her job but not accepting France\u2019s asylum offer, calling herself \u201ca patriot\u201d. More than 320,000 Ukrainian citizens have returned to help their country fight since Russia began its invasion, according to the state border guard service of Ukraine. Canada will offer Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion a temporary Canadian residence permit for up to three years. The Australian government has imposed sanctions on two Russian oligarchs who have assets in the country as well as placing sanctions on Russia\u2019s finance ministry and 11 additional banks and government organisations. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his latest address: \u201cThe occupants thought they were going to Ukraine which they had seen before, in 2014-2015, which they corrupted and were not afraid of, but we are different now.\u201d About 130 people have been rescued so far from the basement of a theatre hit by a Russian airstrike in the besieged southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, officials said. Hundreds of people were hiding beneath the theatre, which was designated as a shelter for displaced civilians, when it was struck on Wednesday. Meanwhile, about 30,000 civilians have fled Mariupol city so far, local authorities said. Mariupol\u2019s city hall said that \u201c80% of residential housing was destroyed\u201d and about 350,000 residents were hiding in shelters and basements in Mariupol. More than 20 people were killed and 25 injured when a Russian airstrike destroyed a school and community centre in Merefa, close to the north-east Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, on Thursday local officials said. The mayor of the besieged Ukrainian city of Melitopol, who was allegedly abducted by Russian forces, was freed in exchange for nine captured Russian conscripts, according to the head of Ukraine\u2019s presidential office. Russia says it will raise allegations that the United States has biological warfare laboratories in Ukraine during Friday\u2019s UN security council meeting, claims that Washington says are disinformation and part of a potential \u201cfalse-flag operation\u201d by Moscow. Lawyers are drafting a peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow but a breakthrough depends on the Kremlin accepting a ceasefire, Ukraine\u2019s defence minister said. Russia was accused by the UK, the US, France, Albania, Ireland and Norway of war crimes, as Paris claimed Vladimir Putin was only pretending to be interested in negotiating a peace deal. The Pentagon reportedly assessed that Putin may resort to threats to use nuclear weapons as sanctions and setbacks on the ground \u201cslowly weaken Russian conventional strength\u201d. \u201cRussia likely will increasingly rely on its nuclear deterrent to signal the west and project strength to its internal and external audiences,\u201d said Lieutenant General Scott Berrier, director of the Defence Intelligence Agency, in new 67-page summary of global threats, according to Bloomberg.

A friend of his to whom the Guardian spoke said he was unable to place calls to the UK and his lawyer could not speak to reporters from outside Iran. He has no immediate family in Iran. He has been sentenced to 10 years for subversion. He says he sleeps on the floor.</p> <p>For years he divided his time between the UK and Iran, teaching English, meeting with other labour and women\u2019s rights activists, and helping them translate materials from and into English.</p> <p>The communication between him, his friends and the Foreign Office seems less than ideal. In August 2020 at the time of his arrest, the Foreign Office said: \u201cWe continue to do all we can to support Mehran and his family, and continue to raise his case at the most senior levels.\u201d But in her comments this week the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, made no voluntary reference to Raoof, suggesting he was never part of the negotiations over the debt.</p> <p>Pressed by Jeremy Corbyn about his case, Truss replied: \u201cI must respect the individual\u2019s request of whether their case should be raised in public. That is why we mention publicly only those individuals who have asked to be named.\u201d</p> <p>Jo Atkins-Potts, Amnesty International UK\u2019s urgent actions campaigner, said she \u201cwas very worried he was being left behind\u201d, saying he was a victim of arbitrary detention.

But the UK, unlike in previous negotiations with the Iranians, took the painful decision, in the interests of getting Ashoori and Zaghari-Ratcliffe home, to exclude him from the trade. A very cold call between the family and Truss showed the family the British had chosen to make him America\u2019s problem.</p> <p>But his case is complicated by the fact that although he was born in Hammersmith hospital in west London, Iran also views him as American. Negotiations over his furlough and the fate of his wife filled some of the last frantic hours at Tehran international airport before Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Ashoori were put on the Sultan of Oman\u2019s private plane to Muscat.</p> <p>Within 48 hours his family reported armed officers had taken him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/british-iranian-morad-tahbaz-returned-to-tehran-prison\">back to jail</a>, and his family accuse the Foreign Office of a betrayal. The foreign secretary in the Commons was never asked about the length of the furlough, but gave the impression she had negotiated a substantive change from his appalling prison conditions.</p> <p>The family said they believed it was now clear a true furlough was never agreed. \u201cIt was just a home visit to get him out the way, so the Foreign Office could have their victory lap,\u201d they said. The Foreign Office insisted that the Iranians had told them that Tahbaz was only being returned to the prison to have an ankle tag installed and they expected to see him returned home in the coming hours.</p> <p>Claren concluded: \u201cAll our families are just pawns in a shaming international game of chess. The only lesson is that this hostage-taking has to be stopped.\u201d</p>",

Claren explains: \u201cI can speak to her five times a week for five minutes. She is trying to keep her mind alive teaching German to prisoners, and reading all the time. She wants to know everything that is happening in politics, about Ukraine and Afghanistan. \u201cThe German coalition government says they are doing all they can, but I do not know if our government really makes her release part of the talks on the Iran nuclear deal. The new foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, is so busy, and I do not know what priority this has. The only thing I hear from the foreign office is no stone is left unturned.\u201d Germany, like France and the UK, is a signatory to the Iran nuclear talks, but it has strong business relations with Iran, so Claren can only wait and hope. The German foreign office told a Green MP of other German-Iranian dual nationals in Iranian jails. In tears on the phone in Austria, Harika Ghaderi manages to be happy for the released Britons, but feels at her wits\u2019 end as the nuclear talks come to a close. A mother of three, her children were two, nine and 12 years old at the time their father, Dr Kamran Ghaderi, was picked up at Tehran airport in January 2016. She says: \u201cFor the first three months, he was held in a solitary confinement and tortured until he signed a false confession that he was a spy working for Austria and for the United States. \u201cI am now at the end of my energy. I cannot understand how the nuclear deal can be signed and these people ignored. They are innocent. My nine-year-old has never known his father.\u201d Unlike those in the UK, she has no big network of support. The French anthropologist Fariba Adelkhah, specialising in Iranian society, was first jailed in June 2019, allowed on furlough in October 2020 and then suddenly reincarcerated in January 2022 for allegedly breaching the terms of her house arrest, a charge she denies. She and the French academic community wait nervously. There are also British citizens left behind. Least well known is Mehran Raoof, a trade unionist arrested in Tehran on 16 October 2020. A friend of his to whom the Guardian spoke said he was unable to place calls to the UK and his lawyer could not speak to reporters from outside Iran. He has no immediate family in Iran. He has been sentenced to 10 years for subversion. He says he sleeps on the floor. For years he divided his time between the UK and Iran, teaching English, meeting with other labour and women\u2019s rights activists, and helping them translate materials from and into English. The communication between him, his friends and the Foreign Office seems less than ideal. In August 2020 at the time of his arrest, the Foreign Office said: \u201cWe continue to do all we can to support Mehran and his family, and continue to raise his case at the most senior levels.\u201d But in her comments this week the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, made no voluntary reference to Raoof, suggesting he was never part of the negotiations over the debt. Pressed by Jeremy Corbyn about his case, Truss replied: \u201cI must respect the individual\u2019s request of whether their case should be raised in public. That is why we mention publicly only those individuals who have asked to be named.\u201d Jo Atkins-Potts, Amnesty International UK\u2019s urgent actions campaigner, said she \u201cwas very worried he was being left behind\u201d, saying he was a victim of arbitrary detention. Amnesty has no indication that Raoof has asked not to be named, especially given that he is unable to use a phone. The charity plans to ask Truss for clarification on the comments. By contrast, Morad Tahbaz, a London-born businessman and conservationist with British, US and Iranian citizenship arrested in January 2018, had been mentioned by the Foreign Office. But the UK, unlike in previous negotiations with the Iranians, took the painful decision, in the interests of getting Ashoori and Zaghari-Ratcliffe home, to exclude him from the trade. A very cold call between the family and Truss showed the family the British had chosen to make him America\u2019s problem. But his case is complicated by the fact that although he was born in Hammersmith hospital in west London, Iran also views him as American. Negotiations over his furlough and the fate of his wife filled some of the last frantic hours at Tehran international airport before Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Ashoori were put on the Sultan of Oman\u2019s private plane to Muscat. Within 48 hours his family reported armed officers had taken him back to jail, and his family accuse the Foreign Office of a betrayal. The foreign secretary in the Commons was never asked about the length of the furlough, but gave the impression she had negotiated a substantive change from his appalling prison conditions. The family said they believed it was now clear a true furlough was never agreed. \u201cIt was just a home visit to get him out the way, so the Foreign Office could have their victory lap,\u201d they said. The Foreign Office insisted that the Iranians had told them that Tahbaz was only being returned to the prison to have an ankle tag installed and they expected to see him returned home in the coming hours. Claren concluded: \u201cAll our families are just pawns in a shaming international game of chess. The only lesson is that this hostage-taking has to be stopped.\u201d",

Following media reports on Friday, the church\u2019s global board said in a statement that Houston had breached Hillsong\u2019s pastor code of conduct in two incidents over the past decade. \u201cWe have sadly been dealing with two complaints made against Pastor Brian over the last 10 years,\u201d the church\u2019s global board said. The board said the first incident occurred \u201capproximately a decade ago\u201d, in which \u201cinappropriate text messages\u201d from Houston were sent to a staff member, \u201cwhich subsequently resulted in the employee resigning\u201d. \u201cAt the time, Pastor Brian was under the influence of sleeping tablets, upon which he had developed a dependence,\u201d the statement said. The board said it \u201cworked with Pastor Brian to ensure he received professional help to eliminate his dependency on this medication, and this was achieved successfully\u201d. The second investigation concerned a complaint the church received in 2019, about behaviour which Hillsong attributed to medication and alcohol. \u201cFollowing an in-depth investigation, it was found that Pastor Brian became disoriented after a session at the Hillsong Conference, following the consumption of anti-anxiety medication beyond the prescribed dose, mixed with alcohol,\u201d the global board\u2019s statement said. \u201cThis resulted in him knocking on the door of a hotel room that was not his, entering this room and spending time with the female occupant.\u201d The Hillsong global board said \u201cthat whatever the circumstances at this time, this person did not deserve to be placed in the situation she found herself in by Pastor Brian\u201d. \u201cThe investigation by the integrity unit appointed by the global board found that \u2026 the conduct was of serious concern,\u201d it said. \u201cWe apologise unreservedly to the people affected by Pastor Brian\u2019s actions and commit to being available for any further assistance we can provide.\u201d Hillsong said the investigations \u201cwere conducted by either board members or a body appointed by the global board to hear and resolve complaints against credentialled pastors, and were assisted by highly respected external pastors and advisers\u201d.

Rolfe had opposed the release of material relating to his history within the force and the text messages.</p> <p>On 11 March, a jury unanimously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/11/zachary-rolfe-found-not-guilty-of-over-kumanjayi-walker-fatal-shooting\">found Rolfe not guilty</a> of the murder of Walker, and of two alternative charges.</p> <p>His defence team successfully argued prior to his trial that his alleged history within the NT police was not admissible as evidence, in part because no findings of wrongdoing had been made against Rolfe in relation to the four allegedly violent arrests, and because a judge agreed they were not directly relevant to the shooting death of Walker.</p> <p>The prosecution had hoped to include the cases as what is known as tendency evidence, as they argued each incident showed Rolfe had the tendency to use excessive force when arresting men that either caused or had the potential to cause serious injury.</p> <p>It also argued each case showed Rolfe\u2019s tendency to make a false statement or perform another act seeking to justify the excessive use of force.</p> <p>The first of four incidents that the prosecution sought to include as evidence was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/18/zachary-rolfe-lied-about-violent-2018-arrest-northern-territory-judge-found\">arrest of Malcolm Ryder</a> on 1 April 2018.</p> <p>Ryder was charged with hindering Rolfe in executing his duties as a police officer and unlawfully assaulting Rolfe following an incident at Ryder\u2019s house in Alice Springs.</p> <p>But a judge later dismissed the charges against Ryder and found his version of events \u2013 that Rolfe had punched him in the face and then slammed his head into the ground, leaving him unconscious and in a pool of blood during the arrest \u2013 was the \u201cmore likely\u201d version of how the injuries occurred than the evidence provided by Rolfe.</p> <p>The prosecution in the Walker case alleged that Rolfe had lied on a statutory declaration about the case, and in an entry on a police database.</p> <p>It also alleged that later on the day of the arrest Rolfe asked a detective at Alice Springs police station to scratch his face so that he could blame that injury on Ryder in order to justify his use of force.</p> <p>On 28 February 2019, Rolfe sent a text message that read: \u201cAlice Springs sucks ha ha. The good thing is it\u2019s like the Wild West and fuck all the rules in the job really \u2026 but it\u2019s a shit hole. Good to start here coz of the volume of work but will be good to leave.\u201d</p> <p>The prosecution sought to admit the text message as evidence that Rolfe felt the \u201crules\u201d did not apply to him when serving as a police officer.</p> <p>The prosecution also sought to include as evidence that, a little over a month later, Rolfe arrested a 17-year-old boy known as DX. On the night of 1 April, Rolfe was alleged to have been chasing DX when the boy stopped running and placed himself on the ground.</p> <p>Rolfe was alleged to have \u201cbanged\u201d the boys head into a rock on the ground several times soon after.</p> <p>He had turned off his body-worn camera while giving chase, later saying this was because he did not want the light on the camera to alert the boy to his location while he tracked him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/18/zachary-rolfe-lied-about-violent-2018-arrest-northern-territory-judge-found\">Zachary Rolfe lied about violent 2018 arrest, Northern Territory judge found</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the camera of a colleague recorded the boy saying: \u201cYou banged me against the rock. Why did you do that to me, brother? Why did you hit me against the rock?\u201d</p> <p>Rolfe was heard responding: \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you fall over in the dirt. You hit your head on a rock.\u201d</p> <p>The cut on DX\u2019s head required four sutures. Rolfe said in his statement, which the prosecution alleged was false, that he believed the cut had been caused when DX dived on the ground to hide from police, or otherwise during the police chase.</p> <p>On 30 July 2019, Rolfe wrote the second message that prosecutors hoped to admit as evidence of his disregard for the \u201crules\u201d of policing.</p> <p>In the message, he wrote: \u201cWe have this small team in Alice, IRT, immediate response team. We\u2019re not full time, just get called up from Gd\u2019s [general duties policing] for high risk jobs, it\u2019s a sweet gig, just get to do cowboy stuff with no rules.\u201d</p> <p>On 24 September 2019, Rolfe and another officer questioned a man called Wayne Spencer outside the Todd Tavern. Spencer had a similar appearance to a different man who had recently escaped custody, and was \u201cverbally evasive\u201d before running from police.</p> <p>Rolfe gave chase for about 250m before Spencer allegedly started to slow down. Rolfe was accused of not slowing down but running at \u201cfull force\u201d into Spencer, striking him with outstretched hands.</p> <p>Spencer crashed into a barricade or fence outside a restaurant. He later attended hospital and had his arm placed in a sling because of a sore shoulder.</p> <p>As in the previous two incidents, the prosecution allege Rolfe made false statements after the arrest to justify his use of force.</p> <p>On 12 October 2019, Albert Bailey and his partner were having an argument outside a council building in Alice Springs. A police report found Bailey was standing close to his partner with clenched fists and showing \u201cpre-attack indicators\u201d.</p> <p>Rolfe was alleged to have run at Bailey and pushed him at full speed into the wall of the building without any warning. Bailey fell heavily onto a bench seat, striking his head, and required nine sutures. </p> <p>Walker was shot three times by Rolfe less than a month later when he deployed with three other members of the IRT to Yuendumu, a remote community about 300km from Alice Springs.</p> <p>The prosecution had argued that not only did the four incidents show Rolfe\u2019s tendency to use excessive force and make false statements to justify them, but could help the jury evaluate a statement he made immediately after the shooting of Walker.</p> <p>Walker had stabbed Rolfe prior to the shooting, and Rolfe later gave evidence that he believed Walker had stabbed another officer involved in the attempted arrest, Adam Eberl.</p> <p>Rolfe told Eberl immediately after shooting Walker that it was \u201call good\u201d as Walker was \u201cstabbing me, he was stabbing you\u201d.</p> <p>The prosecution said the four previous incidents involved Rolfe would mean the jury could put into context what appeared to be a \u201cspontaneous and credible utterance\u201d with a history of Rolfe making false statements in the past to justify his use of excessive force</p> <p>In December 2021, David Edwardson QC, for Rolfe, said in a court hearing regarding the evidence that in all four incidents his client had been cleared by his supervisors of using inappropriate force.</p> <p>He argued that Det Snr Sgt Andrew Barram, who had reviewed the arrests for the prosecution, was \u201cnot an expert at all\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI mean to be brutally frank, your honour, I\u2019ll be quite candid about this: the defence position at trial will be that \u2026 he\u2019s a barracker and a gun for hire,\u201d Edwardson said. \u201cAnd he has tailored his statements \u2026 for a particular outcome.\u201d</p> <p>Edwardson also argued that the incidents were irrelevant to the shooting death of Walker, and that the prosecution had \u201ccherry picked\u201d from hundreds of other arrests that Rolfe had completed without incident.</p> <p>Justice John Burns, who ruled that evidence of the cases was inadmissible at trial, found that to prove they had occurred the prosecution would effectively have to \u201cconduct five separate trials all within one proceeding\u201d. He also found the cases were not relevant to the shooting.</p> <p>\u201cNothing in the evidence of the tendency incidents could, by reference to the alleged tendencies, assist the jury in understanding or inferring the accused\u2019s state of mind at the time of the charged events.</p> <p>\u201cThe difference between the circumstances of the tendency incidents and the charged events are such that no inference such as the Crown would ask the jury to draw can be drawn.\u201d</p> <p>Burns\u2019 decision, and the evidence that had been put before him, had been suppressed so as to not prejudice the outcome of Rolfe\u2019s trial.</p> <p>It was also confirmed on Friday that an inquest into Walker\u2019s death will start on 5 September. A directions hearing in the case, before acting NT coroner, Judge Elisabeth Armitage, will be held on 29 March.</p> <p>After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/12/this-case-is-tragic-zachary-rolfe-is-cleared-and-an-aboriginal-family-left-with-questions\">the verdict</a> in Rolfe\u2019s murder trial, his supporters, including the NT police association and Edwardson, as well as Walker\u2019s family, the prosecution and Warlpiri elders, all pointed to the upcoming inquest as a chance to investigate unresolved issues in the case.</p>",

After three of the incidents he was also alleged to have falsified reports, and on one occasion was accused of asking a fellow officer to scratch him to make it appear as if he had been harmed by an offender during an arrest. During the same period, Rolfe sent text messages describing Alice Springs as a \u201cshit hole\u201d like the \u201cwild west\u201d with \u201cfuck all ... rules in the job really\u201d, and saying that when he was deployed with a semi-tactical squad he got \u201cto do cowboy stuff with no rules\u201d. The jury in Rolfe\u2019s trial for murder were not told about his history within the NT police or the text messages. Hundreds of pages of further evidence regarding Rolfe\u2019s case were released on Friday after media outlets including the Guardian applied for the lifting of 26 suppression orders on his case. Rolfe had opposed the release of material relating to his history within the force and the text messages. On 11 March, a jury unanimously found Rolfe not guilty of the murder of Walker, and of two alternative charges. His defence team successfully argued prior to his trial that his alleged history within the NT police was not admissible as evidence, in part because no findings of wrongdoing had been made against Rolfe in relation to the four allegedly violent arrests, and because a judge agreed they were not directly relevant to the shooting death of Walker. The prosecution had hoped to include the cases as what is known as tendency evidence, as they argued each incident showed Rolfe had the tendency to use excessive force when arresting men that either caused or had the potential to cause serious injury. It also argued each case showed Rolfe\u2019s tendency to make a false statement or perform another act seeking to justify the excessive use of force. The first of four incidents that the prosecution sought to include as evidence was the arrest of Malcolm Ryder on 1 April 2018. Ryder was charged with hindering Rolfe in executing his duties as a police officer and unlawfully assaulting Rolfe following an incident at Ryder\u2019s house in Alice Springs. But a judge later dismissed the charges against Ryder and found his version of events \u2013 that Rolfe had punched him in the face and then slammed his head into the ground, leaving him unconscious and in a pool of blood during the arrest \u2013 was the \u201cmore likely\u201d version of how the injuries occurred than the evidence provided by Rolfe. The prosecution in the Walker case alleged that Rolfe had lied on a statutory declaration about the case, and in an entry on a police database. It also alleged that later on the day of the arrest Rolfe asked a detective at Alice Springs police station to scratch his face so that he could blame that injury on Ryder in order to justify his use of force. On 28 February 2019, Rolfe sent a text message that read: \u201cAlice Springs sucks ha ha. The good thing is it\u2019s like the Wild West and fuck all the rules in the job really \u2026 but it\u2019s a shit hole. Good to start here coz of the volume of work but will be good to leave.\u201d The prosecution sought to admit the text message as evidence that Rolfe felt the \u201crules\u201d did not apply to him when serving as a police officer. The prosecution also sought to include as evidence that, a little over a month later, Rolfe arrested a 17-year-old boy known as DX. On the night of 1 April, Rolfe was alleged to have been chasing DX when the boy stopped running and placed himself on the ground. Rolfe was alleged to have \u201cbanged\u201d the boys head into a rock on the ground several times soon after. He had turned off his body-worn camera while giving chase, later saying this was because he did not want the light on the camera to alert the boy to his location while he tracked him. But the camera of a colleague recorded the boy saying: \u201cYou banged me against the rock. Why did you do that to me, brother? Why did you hit me against the rock?\u201d Rolfe was heard responding: \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you fall over in the dirt. You hit your head on a rock.\u201d The cut on DX\u2019s head required four sutures. Rolfe said in his statement, which the prosecution alleged was false, that he believed the cut had been caused when DX dived on the ground to hide from police, or otherwise during the police chase. On 30 July 2019, Rolfe wrote the second message that prosecutors hoped to admit as evidence of his disregard for the \u201crules\u201d of policing. In the message, he wrote: \u201cWe have this small team in Alice, IRT, immediate response team. We\u2019re not full time, just get called up from Gd\u2019s [general duties policing] for high risk jobs, it\u2019s a sweet gig, just get to do cowboy stuff with no rules.\u201d On 24 September 2019, Rolfe and another officer questioned a man called Wayne Spencer outside the Todd Tavern. Spencer had a similar appearance to a different man who had recently escaped custody, and was \u201cverbally evasive\u201d before running from police. Rolfe gave chase for about 250m before Spencer allegedly started to slow down. Rolfe was accused of not slowing down but running at \u201cfull force\u201d into Spencer, striking him with outstretched hands. Spencer crashed into a barricade or fence outside a restaurant. He later attended hospital and had his arm placed in a sling because of a sore shoulder. As in the previous two incidents, the prosecution allege Rolfe made false statements after the arrest to justify his use of force. On 12 October 2019, Albert Bailey and his partner were having an argument outside a council building in Alice Springs. A police report found Bailey was standing close to his partner with clenched fists and showing \u201cpre-attack indicators\u201d. Rolfe was alleged to have run at Bailey and pushed him at full speed into the wall of the building without any warning. Bailey fell heavily onto a bench seat, striking his head, and required nine sutures. Walker was shot three times by Rolfe less than a month later when he deployed with three other members of the IRT to Yuendumu, a remote community about 300km from Alice Springs. The prosecution had argued that not only did the four incidents show Rolfe\u2019s tendency to use excessive force and make false statements to justify them, but could help the jury evaluate a statement he made immediately after the shooting of Walker. Walker had stabbed Rolfe prior to the shooting, and Rolfe later gave evidence that he believed Walker had stabbed another officer involved in the attempted arrest, Adam Eberl. Rolfe told Eberl immediately after shooting Walker that it was \u201call good\u201d as Walker was \u201cstabbing me, he was stabbing you\u201d. The prosecution said the four previous incidents involved Rolfe would mean the jury could put into context what appeared to be a \u201cspontaneous and credible utterance\u201d with a history of Rolfe making false statements in the past to justify his use of excessive force In December 2021, David Edwardson QC, for Rolfe, said in a court hearing regarding the evidence that in all four incidents his client had been cleared by his supervisors of using inappropriate force. He argued that Det Snr Sgt Andrew Barram, who had reviewed the arrests for the prosecution, was \u201cnot an expert at all\u201d. \u201cI mean to be brutally frank, your honour, I\u2019ll be quite candid about this: the defence position at trial will be that \u2026 he\u2019s a barracker and a gun for hire,\u201d Edwardson said. \u201cAnd he has tailored his statements \u2026 for a particular outcome.\u201d Edwardson also argued that the incidents were irrelevant to the shooting death of Walker, and that the prosecution had \u201ccherry picked\u201d from hundreds of other arrests that Rolfe had completed without incident. Justice John Burns, who ruled that evidence of the cases was inadmissible at trial, found that to prove they had occurred the prosecution would effectively have to \u201cconduct five separate trials all within one proceeding\u201d. He also found the cases were not relevant to the shooting. \u201cNothing in the evidence of the tendency incidents could, by reference to the alleged tendencies, assist the jury in understanding or inferring the accused\u2019s state of mind at the time of the charged events. \u201cThe difference between the circumstances of the tendency incidents and the charged events are such that no inference such as the Crown would ask the jury to draw can be drawn.\u201d Burns\u2019 decision, and the evidence that had been put before him, had been suppressed so as to not prejudice the outcome of Rolfe\u2019s trial. It was also confirmed on Friday that an inquest into Walker\u2019s death will start on 5 September. A directions hearing in the case, before acting NT coroner, Judge Elisabeth Armitage, will be held on 29 March. After the verdict in Rolfe\u2019s murder trial, his supporters, including the NT police association and Edwardson, as well as Walker\u2019s family, the prosecution and Warlpiri elders, all pointed to the upcoming inquest as a chance to investigate unresolved issues in the case.",

In some cases, nations have competing claims over the same land. Deciding who will get the money to purchase that land would be difficult.</p> <p>Kouslaa Kessler-Mata, a member of the Truth &amp; Healing Council, said the state needed to have a policy in place to resolve those conflicts \u201cso that we don\u2019t just wake up one day and say, \u2018Oh, guess what?

He has called that goal a \u201cmandate\u201d, saying it is important for California to reduce the effects of climate change.</p> <p>Crowfoot echoed that sentiment Friday, saying preserving land would allow more plants and soil to \u201cactually absorb that pollution from the atmosphere and store it in the land\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNature is needed in this effort to combat climate change,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Under Newsom\u2019s budget proposal, the California Natural Resources Agency (CNRA) would manage the new Indigenous funding commitment.</p> <p>This year, CNRA and its entities have awarded funds for various <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2022/03/18/governor-newsom-proposes-100-million-to-support-tribal-led-initiatives-that-advance-shared-climate-and-conservation-goals/\">projects</a> such as the Ocean Protection Council which funded $1.3m to the Wiyot Tribe for the purchase and restoration of 48 acres of its ancestral land. The funding also helps to strengthen coastal resiliency across the Humboldt coastline.</p> <p>Other CNRA-funded projects include youth access grants worth up to $773,000.

But rather than have the government do all of that, Newsom said Indigenous leaders should have a say in what lands get preserved. \u201cWe know that California Native peoples have always had an interdependent relations with land, waters, everything that makes up the state of California,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cUnfortunately we also know that the state has had a role in violently disrupting those relations.\u201d The money is one piece of Newsom\u2019s $286.4bn budget proposal. The state legislature would have to approve the spending before it could happen. The funding would not function like a traditional state grant program, where the state decides who gets the money and how they can spend it. Instead, natural resources secretary Wade Crowfoot said the administration is \u201ccommitted to developing a structure or a process where tribes are deciding where these funds are going\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s so much that we need to learn, obviously, from the tribal communities about how to do this,\u201d Crowfoot said. \u201cWe\u2019ve disconnected ourselves from all the tribal ecological knowledge that we need to heal and care for the lands.\u201d He added: \u201cWe heard loud and clear in our consultations with more than 70 different California Native American tribes a strong desire from tribal governments to play a leading role in restoration and conservation efforts that benefit tribal communities and honor their connections to the lands and waters.\u201d The proposal comes amid a growing Land Back movement to return Indigenous homelands to the descendants of those who lived there for millennia before European settlers arrived. Aside from buying land, nations in California could also use the money for programs that address climate change and workforce development. Crowfoot spoke during a meeting of the California Truth &amp; Healing Council, established by Newsom in 2019 to \u201cclarify the record\u201d of the \u201ctroubled relationship between tribes and the state\u201d. Indigenous leaders were enthusiastic about Newsom\u2019s proposal, but worried how it would work in practice. In some cases, nations have competing claims over the same land. Deciding who will get the money to purchase that land would be difficult. Kouslaa Kessler-Mata, a member of the Truth &amp; Healing Council, said the state needed to have a policy in place to resolve those conflicts \u201cso that we don\u2019t just wake up one day and say, \u2018Oh, guess what? Right now, that land that you thought was in your ancestral territory is now being acquired by someone else.\u201d Caleem Sisk, chief of the Winnemem Wintu Tribe, noted some nations \u2013 like hers \u2013 are not recognized by the federal government and have few resources of other nations that are federally recognized. \u201cWe\u2019re not in any position to really compete with them for a grant,\u201d she said. Crowfoot said he did not have a \u201cquick and easy answer\u201d to some of the council\u2019s concerns. He said ultimately the state will need \u201csome sort of consultative body to help us shape this funding to be able to work through that\u201d. Newsom signed an executive order in 2020 directing that 30% of California\u2019s land and coastal waters be preserved by 2030. He has called that goal a \u201cmandate\u201d, saying it is important for California to reduce the effects of climate change. Crowfoot echoed that sentiment Friday, saying preserving land would allow more plants and soil to \u201cactually absorb that pollution from the atmosphere and store it in the land\u201d. \u201cNature is needed in this effort to combat climate change,\u201d he said. Under Newsom\u2019s budget proposal, the California Natural Resources Agency (CNRA) would manage the new Indigenous funding commitment. This year, CNRA and its entities have awarded funds for various projects such as the Ocean Protection Council which funded $1.3m to the Wiyot Tribe for the purchase and restoration of 48 acres of its ancestral land. The funding also helps to strengthen coastal resiliency across the Humboldt coastline. Other CNRA-funded projects include youth access grants worth up to $773,000. The grants were distributed to the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians, Robinson Rancheria of Pomo Indians, and the Wiyot Tribe. In January, a group of 10 nations residing on the northern California coast reclaimed parts of their ancestral land, including ancient redwoods. Save the Redwoods League, a non-profit conservation group transferred more than 500 hectares (1,200 acres) on the Lost Coast to the InterTribal Sinkyone Wilderness Council. The group has since been responsible for protecting the land dubbed Tc\u2019ih-L\u00e9h-D\u00fb\u00f1, or \u201cFish Run Place\u201d in the Sinkyone language.",

As Putin was finishing his speech, the broadcast was suddenly cut off and state television showed patriotic songs. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov blamed a \u201ctechnical failure\u201d. A World Food Programme (WFP) official said on Friday that food supply chains in Ukraine were collapsing, with a portion of infrastructure destroyed and many grocery stores and warehouses now empty. Jakob Kern, WFP emergency coordinator for the Ukraine crisis, also expressed concern about the situation in \u201cencircled cities\u201d such as Mariupol. Pope Francis has denounced the \u201cperverse abuse of power\u201d on display in Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and called for aid to Ukrainians, whom he said had been attacked in their \u201cidentity, history and tradition\u201d and were \u201cdefending their land\u201d. Francis\u2019 comments were some of his strongest yet",

Brad Brooks-Rubin, a strategic adviser for the Responsible Jewellery Council and former special adviser for Conflict Diamonds to the US Department of State, published a public statement saying: \u201cGiven the role of a Russian state-owned diamond mining company in the global supply chain \u2026 The decisions \u2013 or, more specifically, the lack thereof \u2013 from the Responsible Jewellery Council regarding this company and overall crisis so far are insufficient.\u201d He said: \u201cThis is my own personal statement and admittedly one made outside established processes, but I think it is important to be transparent.\u201d Brooks-Rubin told the Guardian the council\u2019s code of practice \u201cprovides multiple bases for action against Alrosa\u201d. \u201cI hope there will be a formal investigation into those issues and that action will take place.\u201d Technical compliance with sanctions was not the same as responsibility, he said. \u201cIf a company wants to say, \u2018We are continuing to source diamonds from Alrosa, because if we don\u2019t, we won\u2019t have any products to sell you\u2019\u2026 Let the consumer decide, let society decide whether or not that\u2019s OK,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the moment we have a scenario where \u2026 we don\u2019t necessarily give an answer about what we\u2019re doing. And I think that\u2019s coming up short.\u201d The Guardian contacted a number of Alrosa customers. Tiffany &amp; Co and diamond firm Leo Schachter did not return requests for interviews or comment. RJC chair David Bouffard, of Signet, did not return requests for an interview. RJC executive director Iris Van der Veken did not respond to questions regarding Alrosa\u2019s continued membership, or whether the council had told members to pause purchasing Russian diamonds, but referred to a press release indicating Alrosa had voluntarily stepped down from the board and committees, and correspondence to members asking they \u201cstrictly follow all applicable sanctions issued in your jurisdictions\u201d. Villegas says key industry bodies\u2019 silence on the matter of Alrosa diamonds has been remarkable \u2013 and could taint consumers\u2019 perception of diamonds for years to come. \u201cAll the work that has been done over the years to try to turn the industry reputation around, and show meaningful progress towards diamonds that do good [could] be undermined by current silence,\u201d she says. \u201cFrom the biggest players that have responsibility roles in the industry, or label what\u2019s quote-unquote, responsible? It\u2019s been a deafening silence.\u201d",
