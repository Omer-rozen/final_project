Shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, deputy leader Angela Rayner and shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds have written to Kwasi Kwarteng, asking if he will begin proceedings for what they called the \u201cscandalous action\u201d of the ferry company. Under section 193 of the Trade Union Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, employers who want to make more than 100 people redundant have a duty to notify the business secretary of their plans, before giving notice to the workers. The employer is also required to do so at least 45 days before the dismissals. P&amp;O Ferries sacked 800 staff on Thursday, planning to replace them with cheaper agency workers. It has emerged that ministers were informed in advance about the mass redundancies. In their letter to Kwarteng, the Labour MPs wrote: \u201cAn employer who fails to provide that notification is committing a criminal offence, and liable to an unlimited fine. It is for you, as secretary of state, to launch that action.\u201d They asked: \u201cWill you be commencing criminal proceedings against P&amp;O Ferries, as well as individual directors and managers as permitted under law?

He asked the ferry company a series of questions about why it had failed to follow processes expected of employers dismissing a large number of staff. Kwarteng has given the company until 5pm on Tuesday 22 March to respond before deciding whether to make a formal complaint to the prosecuting authority. Labour and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) are calling on all MPs to back the opposition motion to ban \u201cfire and rehire\u201d, the practice where staff are let go, only to be re-employed on worse terms and conditions. Labour is expected to force an emergency vote on the issue in parliament on Monday. A Commons bill that would have banned the practice was blocked by ministers last October. The government said at the time it opposed such actions, but believed legislation was the wrong way to respond. The TUC\u2019s general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, called on MPs from all parties to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and support Labour\u2019s motion. \u201cP&amp;O ferries and its owner DP World have acted without shame.

O\u2019Grady called on the company to immediately reinstate all sacked staff, without any loss of pay. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, criticised the treatment of workers by the ferry company. \u201cWhat we are seeing is appalling, the way that they have treated their workers, it is awful, it is wrong,\u201d Sunak said told the BBC on Sunday. He added ministers were examining the company\u2019s actions and whether they complied with regulations on dismissing workers. Employment lawyers reacted with surprise to the company\u2019s move to sack 800 crew out of the blue, and said P&amp;O Ferries may have broken several laws, potentially leaving it open to claims of unfair dismissal. Over the weekend, angry protests were held at ports across the UK. Trade union leaders and politicians joined sacked P&amp;O Ferries workers in Dover, Hull, Liverpool and Larne amid growing rage over the company\u2019s decision, with more protests planned for the coming days, including outside parliament on Monday. On Sunday, P&amp;O warned customers that its services would be \u201cunable to run for the next few days\u201d. The company said it was \u201cadvising travellers of alternative arrangements\u201d for its cross-Channel and Irish Sea routes. A spokesperson for P&amp;O Ferries said it had taken the decision to make the staff redundant \u201cas a last resort and only after full consideration of all other options\u201d, after it made a \u00a3100m loss. \u201cUltimately, we concluded that the business wouldn\u2019t survive without fundamentally changed crewing arrangements, which in turn would inevitably result in redundancies,\u201d they said.",

Played on the ground - tarmac, asphalt or concrete - and using a 21 x 10ft court with an 8in \u2018net\u2019 made of wood, it originated in the 1930s when locals from the working class communities watched lawn tennis being enjoyed by the island\u2019s elite. They then procured some balls, began playing with their hands and a new code of the sport was spawned.<br></p> <p>Necessity is the mother of invention and soon these pioneers realised that by stripping the yellow felt from the tennis balls - leaving just the bouncy rubber inner - and using wooden paddles, they had a fast-paced game that was cheap and fun. The rules are similar to table tennis, with either singles or doubles and the aim to reach 21 points, with service alternating every five.<br><br>These days there is a Barbados Road Tennis Association and a national tournament every year to coincide with the independence day celebrations on 30 November. The ministry of sport estimates there are over 1,000 players on the island, be it those who take it seriously or simply as a hobby, and there is growing ambition to one day see it feature in the Olympics.<br><br>Road Tennis requires a strong core and fast reflexes, with players stooping throughout its rapid rallies. This demonstration was being staged at the Malcolm Marshall End of the ground and it is said that the legendary former fast bowler himself was a keen player back in the day, using it to keep up his fitness and hand-eye skills during the off-season.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Cricket_Ali/status/1505221383646846980\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The traditional Barbadian sport of Road Tennis taking place during the (road) cricket lunch interval <a href=\"https://t.co/rIiiKh33i8\">pic.twitter.com/rIiiKh33i8</a></p>&mdash; Ali Martin (@Cricket_Ali) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Cricket_Ali/status/1505221383646846980?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 19, 2022</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-62373de88f081efd3277000a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-03-20T14:46:03.746Z\">2.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Brathwaite suggests </strong>England set 225; Finn laughs in his face: 260.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-62373db08f081efd32770008\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-03-20T14:44:12.125Z\">2.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The umpires are out</strong>, taking a peek.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-62373c098f081efd3276fffd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-03-20T14:41:38.057Z\">2.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Rain stops play: England 76-3 are  172 runs ahead</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>23.2 overs: England 76-3 ( Lawrence 1, Stokes 1) </strong>Brathwaite switches his bowlers about as Roach is thrown the ball, but he only gets a couple of deliveries before the rain starts to fall and the covers are run on by groundsman in colourful rain gear.</p> <p>\u201cYour metaphor about too much accelerator before the engine perks up makes me wonder how long such language will last\u2019\u201d writes John Starbuck.</p> <p>\u201c As a driver of an EV for several years now I can foresee a time when explanations are going to be needed, when the engine doesn\u2019t have to be warmed up at all - it is there and ready always.

Holder bowls wide and Lees waits, leans, and sends the ball spinning through cover point for four. A couple more and that\u2019s the fifty partnership from 101 balls - a fine starting stat to slip in the jacket pocket and riches indeed compared to a few months ago.</p> <p>\u201cI completely understand why people are finding this match boring,\u201d writes Robert Ellson, \u201cand the worries about the detrimental effects poor pitches have on the future of the game are completely valid.

Brathwaite\u2019s concentration was fantastic. Leach\u2019s perseverance similarly so. Stokes rising above the conditions on the second day was absolutely spectacular: a really great innings. It\u2019s certainly been a test of endurance for spectators, but part of Test cricket\u2019s infinite variety is that it\u2019s a test of endurance. I watched almost every ball yesterday, got up to make a cup of tea and missed Mahmood\u2019s first test wicket. I lost concentration just as Jason Holder did. If you struggled as a spectator (or an OBO reporter!) yesterday it gives you an ersatz experience of what the challenge is for the players.</p> <p><br>Would you want all Test matches to be like this? No. But nor would I want them all to be Iike the one in Chennai(?) last winter where it was such a dustbowl that Root took 5-6 and England were immediately 0-2 after three balls of spin in their innings (with the third being an overturned DRS decision!)

      "bodyText": "Time to sign off \u2013 I\u2019ll leave you with Ali Martin\u2019s report from Bridgetown. Thanks for joining me; we\u2019ll be back on Thursday for the third and final Test of the series. Bye! Here\u2019s the England interim head coach, Paul Collingwood: \u201cI think the attitude from the boys was absolutely fantastic ... I think everyone was expecting a draw, but we wanted to go out and win that game. We were hoping 60-odd overs would give us a sniff ... playing on these pitches is hard work, but if we keep showing that resilience and skill, we\u2019ll get close to that win.\u201d \u201cThe remarkable sight of England\u2019s gully fielders on their knees, seemingly praying for the next wicket, is the image that will remain etched on my memory of this rather unmemorable Test match,\u201d writes Colum Fordham. \u201cHowever, one lesson learned is that England need to experiment with Matt Parkinson. Leach is good but doesn\u2019t get enough overspin to threaten the batsmen. Credit to Brathwaite, though. What a hero for the West Indies!\u201d Here\u2019s the Windies captain and player of the match, Kraigg Brathwaite. \u201cWe want a result in the last Test, hopefully going our way! England put up 500 and bowled really well, so for us to put up 400 and save the match was a great effort from us.\u201d Brathwaite faced more balls in one Test than any West Indies player before. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to hear \u2013 it was great to have my family here today to see it; I\u2019m very happy and thankful.\u201d \u201cIt was really pleasing to see us make a substantial first-innings total, for the first time in a long time,\u201d says Joe Root, who also praises Dan Lawrence. \u201cHe\u2019s been wonderful ... what I\u2019ve noticed is how selfless he is. His first hundred won\u2019t be long if he keeps playing like that.\u201d \u201cThese wickets haven\u2019t been the best for seam bowlers, but they\u2019ve showed great skill and dedication,\u201d Root says of debutants Matt Fisher and Saqib Mahmood. On the declaration, he says \u201cit\u2019s a tricky one ... you don\u2019t want to give them too many overs \u2013 and would 10 more have made a difference to us? Maybe not.\u201d Will Matt Parkinson get a call-up for Grenada? \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see what kind of wicket we\u2019ll get ... Jack [Leach] is bowling with great control, he\u2019s finding his feet and looking comfortable at this level.\u201d That\u2019s it \u2013 the second Test in Barbados, like the first in Antigua, has petered out to end in a draw. After the dog days that came before, this final day at least offered intrigue, with England making early in roads and threatening to force a dramatic victory after what felt like a late declaration. Joe Root\u2019s side always seemed to be a wicket away from really threatening, and the one they really needed never came, the immovable Kraigg Brathwaite hitting 56 off 184 balls to get the job done. 65th over: West Indies 135-5 (Brathwaite 56, Da Silva 30) Root for the final allocated over, although play can go on for another 15 minutes. Whether it should is another question. Da Silva runs through his repertoire of extravagant defensive shots. Six maidens in a row, and here comes the handshake ... 64th over (one left): West Indies 135-5 (Brathwaite 56, Da Silva 30) The light meter is out, and Jack Leach is bowling his 95th over of the match. And what\u2019s this? A big appeal, Leach convinced that Brathwaite edged through to Woakes. England review and the Windies captain breaks into a grin \u2013 and well he might, it didn\u2019t trouble his bat. 63rd over (two left): West Indies 135-5 (Brathwaite 56, Da Silva 30) Root with the ball now \u2013 there\u2019s no light for the seamers \u2013 and he almost shifts Da Silva with a ball that drifts across. He wafts awkwardly at it but it drops harmlessly to the floor. 62nd over (three left): West Indies 135-5 (Brathwaite 56, Da Silva 30) Leach would still love to dislodge Brathwaite for a second time, and his first ball pings off the track, up to shoulder height. After that, it\u2019s fuller and flatter, and no trouble for the batter. 61st over (four left): West Indies 135-5 (Brathwaite 56, Da Silva 30) An uneventful maiden from Lawrence, and with the light fading over Bridgetown I\u2019ll stick my neck out and call this a draw. 60th over (five left): West Indies 135-5 (Brathwaite 56, Da Silva 30) Root continues to crowd Brathwaite, who frankly looks like he could do this all week. A quick couple and plenty more steely defence. The Windies batters take an impromptu drinks break, and the Barmy Army break into song one more time. 59th over (six left): West Indies 133-5 (Brathwaite 54, Da Silva 30) Da Silva picks another poor ball from Lawrence \u2013 his willingness to attack has helped his team breathe at crucial moments. He passes Blackwood\u2019s total in 45 balls \u2013 Blackwood took 84 balls to reach 27. I was thinking the same \u2013 even if it\u2019s a roll of the dice, surely it\u2019s worth a go when one wicket could make the difference. It already feels too late now, though, with the light fading fast. 58th over (seven left): West Indies 127-5 (Brathwaite 53, Da Silva 25) Leach is still threatening on occasion, an awkward ball popping up onto to Brathwaite\u2019s bat handle but dropping into no man\u2019s land. Yeah, maiden. 57th over (eight left): West Indies 127-5 (Brathwaite 53, Da Silva 25) Lawrence continues \u2013 it looks like England are spinning all the way. He\u2019s not causing the disruption he was at the start. Da Silva is all over his last ball, dragged down and sent through midwicket for four. 56th over (nine left): West Indies 122-5 (Brathwaite 53, Da Silva 20) Barcelona are 4-0 up at the Bernab\u00e9u, but never mind that \u2013 there\u2019s a Test to be won. Leach gets a look at Da Silva, who defends stoutly enough before nudging a single. 55th over (10 left): West Indies 122-5 (Brathwaite 53, Da Silva 20) Play can go on until 6pm (10pm GMT), so we may see more than the 10 allotted overs. Or fewer, if the light fades. Brathwaite plays off the back foot for three, and then tucks Lawrence away for another four. That\u2019s his half century, racked up in 157 balls. 54th over (11 left): West Indies 113-5 (Brathwaite 46, Da Silva 18) With the end almost in sight, Brathwaite has to remember the short tail waiting nervously in the pavilion \u2013 he swipes at a full Leach ball which whistles between bat and pad, missing off stump by millimetres. A slice of hard-earned luck for the Windies captain. 53rd over (12 left): West Indies 113-5 (Brathwaite 46, Da Silva 18) Some consternation from England\u2019s fielders at Josh Da Silva wearing a helmet, but only against Stokes. The batter heaves a short ball to the boundary, and has raced to 18 off 27 balls, attack being the best form of defence and all that. 52nd over (13 left): West Indies 109-5 (Brathwaite 46, Da Silva 14) Leach with a peach that gets Brathwaite moving forward and just beats the edge! The Windies captain still can\u2019t afford to blink on a single ball. Maiden, and the floodlights are flickering into life ... 51st over (14 left): West Indies 109-5 (Brathwaite 46, Da Silva 14) Root calls on Ben Stokes at the resumption, and he offers textbook, muscular stuff, trying to draw pace and movement by sheer force of will. No such luck, Brathwaite picking up a single \u2013 and another over seen off. 50th over: West Indies 108-5 (Brathwaite 45, Da Silva 14) Root continues and Da Silva slashes another boundary, beyond the reach of sub fielder Matt Parkinson. Drinks, and 15 overs left to play. 49th over: West Indies 102-5 (Brathwaite 45, Da Silva 8) Leach v Braithwaite, a battle as old as time, plays out another maiden. Overs beginning to run out for England ... 48th over: West Indies 102-5 (Brathwaite 45, Da Silva 8) Root has a go at ruffling Da Silva, but a short one is pulled beyond Bairstow and all the way to four. The new batter adds another boundary, and the hosts are into triple figures. 47th over: West Indies 94-5 (Brathwaite 45, Da Silva 0) Leach and Brathwaite renew acquaintances \u2013 they must feel they know each other on a telepathic level by now. It\u2019s a maiden! Eighteen overs left ... 46th over: West Indies 94-5 (Brathwaite 45, Da Silva 0) A single from Brathwaite, with Ben Stokes excited to get Da Silva on strike. \u201cIt\u2019s a Derek Pringle!\u201d Da Silva shakes it off and stands up well to another over of trickery from triple-threat Dan Lawrence. \u201cGully was my usual fielding position in the long ago,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cIt really put the batters off because it ratcheted up the pressure and they got pretty nervous. Many was the catch I took from people having a slash (as they sometimes said).\u201d Pure poetry, John. 45th over: West Indies 93-5 (Brathwaite 44, Da Silva 0) A wicket-maiden for Leach, with a helmetless Josh Da Silva next to the crease. Twenty overs remaining \u2013 light permitting \u2013 five wickets to take. Is it now a case of get Brathwaite, win the Test? Oh, hello \u2013 an unremarkable ball from Leach prompts a strange choice of shot from Holder, and Dan Lawrence snaffles an exceptional diving catch at short cover! A 24-ball duck for Jason Holder, and game very much on. 44th over: West Indies 93-4 (Brathwaite 44, Holder 0) A couple of testers from Lawrence for Holder, still on zero from 21 deliveries. Root has a chat with Bairstow and reintroduces the double-gully for Leach\u2019s next over. 43rd over: West Indies 92-4 (Brathwaite 44, Holder 0) Brathwaite defends another six Leach deliveries, taking his total for the match past 250, threatening a new record for a batsman from one bowler in a Test. The Windies are looking comfortable again \u2013 time for Stokes? 42nd over: West Indies 92-4 (Brathwaite 44, Holder 0) Lawrence continues, keeping both batsmen on their toes for the loss of one leg bye. Holder swings and edges into his pad, perhaps forgetting what the assignment is here. 41st over: West Indies 91-4 (Brathwaite 44, Holder 0) Two kneeling gullies for Leach. Two gullies, Joe? Two? That\u2019s insane. A maiden, Holder in full defensive mode. 40th over: West Indies 91-4 (Brathwaite 44, Holder 0) Slip, leg slip and two short legs in place for Lawrence, who gets another big lbw shout against Brathwaite. It was turning sharply into the pads but heading over the wicket. The hosts aren\u2019t exactly rocking, but certainly a little wobblier than they were an hour ago. 39th over: West Indies 89-4 (Brathwaite 42, Holder 0) An uncomfortable over for new man Jason Holder, who ventures into Jack Leach\u2019s Gully but lives to tell the tale, a kneeling Bairstow unable to reel it in. 38th over: West Indies 89-4 (Brathwaite 42, Holder 0) Jason Holder sees off Leach\u2019s final ball, and now it\u2019s time for Dan Lawrence to keep the pressure on, four fielders crouched around Brathwaite. The batsman gets squared up after misreading the length, but otherwise keeps doing what he does. Just as I was trying to work out how many futile overs Leach had left, he strikes to remove Jermaine Blackwood, and breathe life back into England\u2019s pursuit of victory! Perfect length, jags sharply and edged to Jonny Bairstow, kneeling at gully. Jack Leach\u2019s Gully claims another victim ... 36th over: West Indies 86-3 (Brathwaite 39, Blackwood 27) Leach returns from the Joel Garner end, from where he has struggled to find any turn at all ... 36th over: West Indies 86-3 (Brathwaite 39, Blackwood 27) Lawrence loses his length and a T20 briefly breaks out, Blackwood punishing two poor balls with boundaries. But then a big appeal as Lawrence catches the edge of Blackwood\u2019s pad \u2013 both the umpire and Root are unmoved, and with good cause. 35th over: West Indies 78-3 (Brathwaite 39, Blackwood 19) Mahmood with an overstep, then a rejig in the field \u2013 with Jonny Bairstow vocally explaining to the bowler where he should aim. Blackwood is unmoved, and the Windies pick up a whopping six off that over. An email from Kevin Farrelly, titled \u201cJack Leach\u2019s Gully\u201d \u2013 which sounds like a great lost American folk song. \u201cLeach is turning it away from the right handers and, as a regular watcher at the the CACG, I\u2019ve seen him get plenty of wickets caught in the gully. The leg slip question, though, is harder to answer ...\u201d 34th over: West Indies 71-3 (Brathwaite 38, Blackwood 14) Flickers of fallibility from both batsmen since tea, and Lawrence has Brathwaite backed up, an inside edge squeaking to safety. 33rd over: West Indies 70-3 (Brathwaite 37, Blackwood 14) Kraigg Brathwaite has now faced more balls in one Test match than any other West Indies player in history \u2013 583, edging past Brian Lara\u2019s 582 against England in 2004. Mahmood persists against Blackwood, hoping for a lapse in concentration, and gets a play and a miss for his efforts. 32nd over: West Indies 69-3 (Brathwaite 36, Blackwood 14) In the break, Carlos Brathwaite admitted that those Dan Lawrence off-breaks make him uneasy \u2013 and he almost does for namesake Kraigg, beating the lifted bat and hitting Brathwaite\u2019s thigh. It looked to be turning way beyond leg-stump, and there\u2019s no review. Brathwaite then runs for three, perhaps to wake himself up a bit. 31st over: West Indies 66-3 (Brathwaite 33, Blackwood 14) Mahmood, England\u2019s danger man in the afternoon, will start off the evening session. The pitch is not offering him quite so much any more, a downbeat over punctuated by a single Brathwaite run. There are 34 overs left for England to find seven wickets. As some of you may have noticed, this is the same scenario as the first Test in Antigua; West Indies are 65-3, and England need seven wickets to win. There\u2019s been some interesting choices in the field \u2013 as far as I can tell, the addition of a gully is a Somerset thing, Root trying to recreate the Taunton dustbowl here in Barbados. A promising start for England in pursuit of the implausible, with Saqib Mahmood striking twice \u2013 but the Windies\u2019 go-to duo of Kraigg Brathwaite and Jermaine Blackwood have steadied the ship. The draw remains firmly on the cards but it\u2019s not quite over yet; more soon. 30th over: West Indies 65-3 (Brathwaite 32, Blackwood 14) Time for Dan Lawrence, who dislodged Jermaine Blackwood in the first innings, to try and do so again before tea. Oof, his final ball stays very low, and almost traps Blackwood in front. That would have been something. 29th over: West Indies 63-3 (Brathwaite 32, Blackwood 12) A silly mid-off joins the cluster of fielders at Blackwood\u2019s feet, but Leach drifts onto his pads and is put away for three runs. Blackwood into double figures, Brathwaite going absolutely nowhere as tea looms. 28th over: West Indies 60-3 (Brathwaite 32, Blackwood 9) Blackwood nudges Stokes through midwicket, taking him to a Gaylesque nine from 49. 27th over: West Indies 59-3 (Brathwaite 32, Blackwood 8) Leach and Brathwaite add another uneventful chapter to their week-long saga. Maiden, and a maximum of 38 overs remaining. 26th over: West Indies 59-3 (Brathwaite 32, Blackwood 8) Stokes draws a flinch of the shoulders from Brathwaite with a short one that cuts in sharply off the seam. Stokes then has to stop his run-up, distracted by a pitchside DJ in a bright yellow shirt. Stokes offers up a thousand-yard stare, and the man behind the wheels of steel ducks out of sight. The bowler turns his gaze to Blackwood, and his final ball kicks off the surface, but the batsman is unmoved. 25th over: West Indies 58-3 (Brathwaite 31, Blackwood 8) Leach looks the more likely, again finding big turn that has Blackwood on the back foot, before the batsmen cuts away for a couple \u2013 ending a run of 14 dot balls. 24th over: West Indies 56-3 (Brathwaite 31, Blackwood 6) Stokes keeps thundering along, but Brathwaite is starting to look rooted in the crease. Maiden, and we\u2019re now closer to tea than to the last wicket. Are you all watching Forest v Liverpool? For shame. 23rd over: West Indies 56-3 (Brathwaite 31, Blackwood 6) Leach wasn\u2019t having much luck at the Malcolm Marshall end, so now he gets a go from the Joel Garner end. There\u2019s an immediate improvement, the first two deliveries jagging off the surface, the last beating Blackwood\u2019s bat. Blackwood does pinch a couple from a looser ball, taking his total to six off 38 balls. 22nd over: West Indies 54-3 (Brathwaite 31, Blackwood 4) Tea will be at 3.25pm (7.25pm GMT), and England surely need another wicket by then. Stokes keeps working his line, Brathwaite fending him off with a dismissive straight bat. Another maiden. 21st over: West Indies 54-3 (Brathwaite 31, Blackwood 4) Root continues, finding turn and bounce that forces Blackwood back. There\u2019s a middling lbw shout, plenty of \u201clove that, Rooty\u201d from Ben Foakes, and one run from the over. 20th over: West Indies 53-3 (Brathwaite 30, Blackwood 4) Ben Stokes comes in \u2013 perhaps Leach will resume where Root left off at the other end. An overstep for a no-ball, an unwelcome sight for any fidgety patrons looking forward to the tea break. A short ball is jabbed away by Blackwood, short of Lees at short leg. 19th over: West Indies 51-3 (Brathwaite 29, Blackwood 4) Root\u2019s having a bowl! And there\u2019s a big, if not huge, appeal for lbw on Blackwood. It looked to be high and wide, and there\u2019s no review. Maiden, but that\u2019s not important right now. 18th over: West Indies 51-3 (Brathwaite 29, Blackwood 4) Jack Leach fails to find much inspiration, with one drifting delivery put away by Blackwood. He runs three, which feels like showboating at this point. 17th over: West Indies 48-3 (Brathwaite 29, Blackwood 0) Mahmood continues to menace the Windies batsmen with his variations, before Brathwaite clips him airily for four to end the over. A quarter-chance of a catch, but he\u2019s still finding movement. 16th over: West Indies 43-3 (Brathwaite 25, Blackwood 0) The first of 50 overs that the Windies have to see out, and Brathwaite does so, repelling Leach with little fuss and nurdling a couple of runs, perhaps just to stretch his legs. 15th over: West Indies 41-3 (Brathwaite 23, Blackwood 0) Nervy from Blackwood, prodding at a loose, scooting effort that was wide enough to leave alone. Mahmood again summons some fizz from the surface, a snorter that Brathwaite flicks a few feet short of the slips. A maiden for Mahmood, and drinks. 14th over: West Indies 41-3 (Brathwaite 23, Blackwood 0) Brathwaite, surrounded by a gaggle of fielders chatting purposefully, jogs a couple off a wider Leach ball. Ship-steadying in progress out there. 13th over: West Indies 39-3 (Brathwaite 21, Blackwood 0) Vice-captain Jermaine Blackwood joins his skipper at the crease and sees out the over \u2013 a wicket-maiden for Mahmood. If England can dislodge one of this pair soon, this could really be on ... Another for Mahmood, and the pressure cranks up on the Windies another notch. This time, a bouncing ball squares up Bonner good and proper, and it\u2019s shouldered through to Root, with no need for Crawley to get involved this time. 12th over: West Indies 39-2 (Brathwaite 21, Bonner 3) Brathwaite clubs a wide one from Leach straight back down the wicket, whistling past the ears of both bowler and umpire. That one goes for four, before sub Craig Overton saves another with an agile piece of fielding. \u201cI was about to email and ask why England still had Crawley in the slips, and say that it would cost them one day soon,\u201d writes Adam Hirst.\u201d Well it didn\u2019t, luckily, but he\u2019s still there, despite not seeming to catch anything ever. Is it like junior school football, where you put the biggest lad at centre-back because he\u2019s least trouble there?\u201d Nonsense. They don\u2019t just stick the big lad at centre-back, that\u2019s where I used to play ... ah. 11th over: West Indies 33-2 (Brathwaite 15, Bonner 3) Mahmood has Bonner worried with a ball that skids up off the seam, but is then picked for three runs through the covers. 10th over: West Indies 29-2 (Brathwaite 14, Bonner 0) Like Campbell before him, Shamarh Brooks never looked remotely comfortable. The eternal Kraigg Brathwaite is now joined by Nkrumah Bonner. A worrying moment for England as Ben Stokes stays down after fielding a Brathwaite drive \u2013 but he\u2019s back on his feet. The Windies captain then sends Leach away past mid-on for four. What did I tell you? A shortish ball from Mahmood is edged apologetically into the slips, where Zak Crawley can only juggle it into the air \u2013 but Joe Root is on hand to collect his 150th Test catch. Well! 9th over: West Indies 23-1 (Brathwaite 8, Brooks 4) Saqib Mahmood gets the nod from Root, and serves up a wild full toss, flicked away for a couple. Just finding his range, I\u2019m sure ... 8th over: West Indies 20-1 (Brathwaite 5, Brooks 4) Thanks, Tanya. Here comes Leach to Brooks, who edges one through the slips for a fortunate boundary. Brooks is nudging at the air next ball as Leach finds some turn, but sees out the rest of the over. 7th over: West Indies 16-1 (Brathwaite 5, Brooks 0) Woakes appeals for an lbw going leg-side and England, wisely, don\u2019t review. And that\u2019s it from me, Niall will take you through to a thrilling England victory at stumps as well as fielding all the choke emails. Have a lovely evening! 6th over: West Indies 14-1 (Brathwaite 4) He does and he breaks through as Campbell presses forward and the ball brushes his glove on the way to Lees at short leg. Much English delight. Given not out on the field it was overturned on review by the third umpire. 5th over: West Indies 14-0 (Brathwaite 4, Campbell 10) Campbell is so nearly tempted by one that moves away by Woakes; and again, swaying his bat out of the way. A tap off the legs brings three from the last ball and it looks as if Leach might get a go with the new ball. 4th over: West Indies 9-0 (Brathwaite 5, Campbell 4) Ian Bishop admires Fisher\u2019s seam position - one for Fisher\u2019s scrap book. He\u2019s also energetic and hard working. Would it be ridiculously bold to suggest he might have leapt over Overton on the strength of this Test match? Four from the over. 3rd over: West Indies 5-0 (Brathwaite 1, Campbell 4) Woakes pleasingly on target, Campbell eyes up a full ones, flashes and edges for four, over the hills and past a diving gully. 2nd over: West Indies 1-0 (Brathwaite 1, Campbell 0) A smart over by Fisher, Brathwaite flashing boldly at one in a way that will please the bowler. \u201cThankfully CG Greenidge is only watching.\u201d muses Jon Akers, \u201c1984, 214no.\u201d With a limp. 1st over: West Indies 1-0 (Brathwaite 1, Campbell 0) Woakes takes the new ball, and the first leaps, and billows off the shoulder of Brathwaite\u2019s bat and squeaks to the left of short leg. \u201cOne rum punch as requested Tanya.\u201d Oh thank you Craig Keeley! \u201cDo you have a long straw?\u201d To match the devil\u2019s long spoon. I feel I should bring the choke chatter to a close for risk of flooding the OBO gearbox. But two more arrived while I put the kettle on: \u201cI managed to resist joining in this conversation until now,\u201d writes Tom Hopkins, \u201cbut Kim Thonger may have a fight on his hands. \u201cAnyone heard of the now-rather-maligned diesel engine? NO CHOKE! to go with the other advantages of simplicity it always had over petrol engines. No carburettor, no tappets (remember feeler-gauges, home mechanics?), so much less temperamental and easier to keep going. \u201cBit like having a reliable opener or two\u2026\u201d And Nat Godden: \u201cLoving the choke chat, and Dominic O\u2019Reilly\u2019s story reminds me of the (possibly apocryphal, certainly prejudice enhancing) tale of the old lady who though it was a hook for her handbag so kept it fully extended at all times. My first car had a choke and I absolutely knew how far from home I could push it right in to use the minimum amount of petrol. A lost skill akin to getting the volume and tone just right to make JetPac load properly on the Spectrum 48K.\u201d Piece of cake for the Windies T20 team but these are red-ball specialists in the limpet sense of the word on a pitch that ain\u2019t doing nothing to speed things along. 39.5 overs: England 185-6 ( Foakes 11, Woakes 9) England lead by 281 Eight overs since the last boundary and many complaints from those who want to check what is happening in City v Southampton and the Grand Prix. Ah, hang on - here come the covers again as the rain starts to fall. They\u2019ll take lunch and I\u2019ll haul my numb body off the sofa. Back shortly. 39th over: England 181-6 ( Foakes 9, Woakes 7) England lead by 277 Seales continues to bowl wide, and, well, nothing much happens. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t work out why the car kept running out of petrol,\u201d taps Dominic O\u2019Reilly. \u201c Finally, a wise mechanic asked my Dad to take him through his usual car starting routine. Turns out he would pull the choke out to the max, drive round with it like that and then push it back in when returning home.\u201d 37th over: England 176-6 ( Foakes 7, Woakes 4) England lead by 272 England mill fitfully on the boundary, waiting for Woakes and Foakes to get \u2018em in singles. \u201cAfternoon Tanya.\u201d Kim Thonger, hello. \u201cI have an entirely different recollection to that of your other correspondents. In every car I drove or owned pre 1982 the choke was a non functional object of blame, serving merely to be chastised for causing lateness for school/work/date/choir/cricket etc. In some vehicles the battery was an alternative scapegoat. Until acquiring a wife who had a knack for internal combustion engines I never had a car with a reliable battery AND a functioning choke. They simply did not exist and I will fight anyone who claims they did. The moral is in my view if you want a mechanical device to work, let a female be in charge.\u201d I like the way this conversation is going. 37th over: England 170-6 ( Foakes 4, Woakes 1) England lead by 266 Lawrence turns down the single - declaration imminent? - only to hole out to one legged pat-a-cake. Woakes joins Foakes for a few singles and... England bat on. A back-foot dog-leg shot to long on. 36th over: England 167-5 (Lawrence 41, Foakes 2) England lead by 263 It\u2019s the two Essex boys, with Chris Woakes left watching on the balcony. Just five off Holder\u2019s over, as Root watches from the balcony wearing some kind of back corset. \u201cHi Tanya. Maybe everyone knows this already...but perhaps useful to share: I\u2019ve just discovered that (in France, at least) the test match is live streamed for free on Youtube by Windies Cricket\u201d Thank you so much Michael Anderson! 35th over: England 162-5 (Lawrence 38, Foakes 0) England lead by 258 Sharp comeback from Seales, whose loosener was greeted by the flashing blade of Lawrence, and smashed straight for six. He followed up with a toe-crusher next ball, and then the wicket. Great cameo from Bairstow. \u201cHello from damp Rhode Island, where the time-zone difference from Barbados works in my favour.\u201d Good afternoon Tat Wood. \u201cWhen Tim Saunders asked, I thought of \u2018skeuomorphism\u2019 but that\u2019s mainly for design-features (the \u2018save\u2019 symbol being a floppy disc, for example) and went looking for the verbal equivalent. Apparently, there isn\u2019t one. There was an attempt to make \u2018idiomatisation\u2019 do the job but that was like trying to make \u2018fetch\u2019 happen. \u201cNext time it rains, maybe we can all try to invent a catchy word for it and spread it. \u201cRe. older cars, I remember when the Morris Minor and others had a thing called a \u2018Trafficator\u2019, in lieu of indicators - it was a little \u2018arm\u2019 with reflectors that came out of the side of the car to show which way you were turning. It was spring-loaded and pulled back with magnets.\u201d Another super catch in the deep as Bairstow bellows the ball down to long off. 34th over: England 152-4 (Lawrence 29, Bairstow 28) England lead by 248 The England brains trust (Root, Trescothick, Collingwood) is mulling over the numbers. Much chin scratching and whispering behind hands. Holder makes the most of the red-ball rules and sends a couple of balls wide of leg stump which Bairstow can\u2019t muscle on to. 33rd over: England 148-4 (Lawrence 28, Bairstow 25) Bairstow is rocking now, all ginger bristle, - two consecutive sixes , one over deep square, the other a yorker boomed back over Joseph\u2019s head , followed by a one-handed skiff for a single. The lead heads towards 250. 32nd over: England 133-4 (Lawrence 27, Bairstow 11) Time for some of Jason Holder\u2019s nice and neat running stitch. Lawrence opens the face and plays an ugly but useful four. 31st over: England 126-4 (Lawrence 22, Bairstow 9) Bairstow, barrel-chested, pivots his club and... inside edges Joseph inches from his stumps and down for four. \u201cI am also of a certain age as the French might say,\u201d writes Adrian Goldman, \u201cand remember the choke as well. But I think it increased the amount of air flowing in, not fuel. Google would know but I am assuming an undergraduate degree in chemistry might lead to the right answer. \u201cAnd while on the subject of cars: I have an electric one - and yes, you can jump it because it has a low voltage dc battery to power lights and the like. If that\u2019s flat, your car is sol. \u201cThat\u2019s my considered non expert opinion.\u201d 30th over: England 118-4 (Lawrence 20, Bairstow 3) Roach thunders in a couple of yorkers, but Lawrence shimmies to drive the third through extra cover for a couple. Another boundary-lite over though. \u201cI am old enough to remember starting handles,\u201d copperplates Simon. \u201cMany years ago, a friend of my father reversed into a snow drift and blocked the exhaust with ice and stalled the engine. Being quick thinking he thought \u2018I know, the starting handle will clear that\u2019, so getting out the starting handle he inserted it into the exhaust pipe and gave it a few quick turns. Turning round he saw our boys in blue, they asked him what he was doing. \u2018 Just trying to start my car\u2019, he replied. They breathalysed him.\u201d 29th over: England 114-4 (Lawrence 17, Bairstow 2) England can\u2019t wriggle to Joseph to the boundary, so are content with a scattering of singles. Hello Matthew Dunnill! \u201cI love to while away the hours with the OBO \u2013 but wow you guys make me feel poor sometimes! And now old as well! \u201cI\u2019m not even 40 and have had 2 cars with chokes \u2013 only recently did I get one with any sort of electrics \u2013 never mind an ACTUAL ELECTRIC CAR! \u201cWow it\u2019s grim up north. \u201c Anyway \u2013 I can\u2019t believe we haven\u2019t got a nice rhyme about how we hope Stokes, Woakes and Foakes don\u2019t choke yet\u2026\u201d There\u2019s still time Matthew, still time. 28th over: England 110-4 (Lawrence 15, Bairstow 0) England continuing to throw the bat and continuing to lose wickets - the lead is 206 though so another fifty will be enough to set the match up. We\u2019re due another hour before lunch because of the rain. Stokes guns for an extremely wide ball from Roach and pings it straight to Brathwaite at cover, who gathers low down on his haunches. 27th over: England 107-3 ( Lawrence 13, Stokes 18) One from the final ball of Roach\u2019s unfinished over. We have our word! Two correspondents at exactly the same time: \u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d writes Greg John. \u201c that Tim Sanders is thinking of skeuomorphism which, according to interaction-design.org, is a term most often used in graphical user interface design to describe interface objects that mimic their real-world counterparts in how they appear and/or how the user can interact with them. A well-known example is the recycle bin icon used for discarding files\u201d On a different note, I feel duly upbraided by those cricket fans telling me that if I don\u2019t like incredibly boring, eventless, and predicable Test matches I\u2019m not a real fan. I bet Robert Wilson et al will be gutted if England declare soon and then attempt to bowl out the Windies in nailbiting fashion.\u201d On the OBO, everyone is invited. Moving quickly onwards... Tim Sanders himself, \u201cHello again Tanya ! I\u2019ve remembered !! t\u2019s \u2018skeuomorphic\u2019 which I think is a great word. Visually, it\u2019s a decorative feature retained from the nature of the original material or method; but no longer functional. Like imitation stitching on a plastic sofa cover. Language has its own equivalent thing, and I reckon we\u2019ll be \u2018warming up engines\u2019 and getting our metaphorical motors running long after we\u2019ve fixed the climate crisis.\u201d Paul Lakin also remembers the choke era: \u201cI\u2019m not even remotely mechanically minded but probably count as an older reader. Wasn\u2019t the choke a way of letting more petrol into the engine \u2013 leading to the timeless mantra \u201cGive it more choke, go on give it a bit more choke, more choke....oh now you\u2019ve flooded it\u201d. Amazing that cars ever caught on really...\u201d On a similar theme, can you jump start an electric car? My childhood was full of people borrowing/using jump leads. In Barbados, a man in a long yellow macintosh is pushing a roller around the ground and the covers are being peeled off. \u201cA choke,\u201d writes Ian Mills knowledgeably, \u201cwas a cable from the dashboard to the carburettor, pulling on the cable richened the mixture being fed into the engine to make it start from cold. Modern cars use fuel injection instead of carburettors.\u201d Ali reports that it is bright outside in Barbados but the covers are still on. \u201cHello Tanya.\u201d Tim Sanders, hello. \u201cIn response to John Starbuck, I think petrol engine metaphors are likely to outlive the technology. It\u2019s for the same reason that people with no knowledge of cricket might talk of \u2018a safe pair of hands\u2019 who will meet a deadline \u2018before close of play\u2019 possibly even in spite of \u2018a sticky wicket\u2019. Or young people who have never put paper in a filing cabinet know what it is to click on a \u2018folder\u2019 icon. The phrases have a life of their own, independent of their origins. There\u2019s a cultural term for this sort of thing which escapes me. I\u2019ll get back to you when I remember it, unless anyone else can help ?\u201d \u201cGood afternoon, Tanya.\u201d Hello Phil Sawyer. \u201cYour older reader may remember the days of not only having to warm up the engine but also having to pull the choke out just to start the thing in the first place. The choke, of course, ...erm.... actually, not being mechanically minded I\u2019ve no idea what the choke actually did. Neither, as far as I could tell, did Pa Sawyer. From sustained observation, its only function in life was to have no effect on the engine whatsoever while causing him to choke with ensuing rage.\u201d I tried to find a picture of a choke in the Guardian\u2019s picture library but it is only offering me something quite unsavoury from Las Vegas. So here is a nostalgic youtube video of how to use the choke on Triumph Spitfire. It is still raining by the way. 26.5 overs: England 106-3 ( Lawrence 12, Stokes 18) Whoopy-doop, Lawrence oils the shoulders and swings a huge six over midwicket before the rain starts again. 26th over: England 99-3 ( Lawrence 6, Stokes 17) Roach is the unfortunate recipient as Stokes decides to throw the bat: FOUR (over extra cover) and SIX (a pick-up and flick over midwicket). A no ball , a wide, and a fistful of quick singles don\u2019t improve Roach\u2019s mood. 25th over: England 80-3 ( Lawrence 3, Stokes 3) Joseph whips some extra something out of the pitch and beats Lawrence\u2019s bat. Lawrence also survives a final-ball bottom-edge which somehow bagatelles past his stumps. \u201cI\u2019m very proud to see the kickback against all the sledging about how boring this Test is to watch,\u201d taps Robert Wilson with a happy smile. \u201c You can\u2019t spend your time making fun of T20 and the Hundred and then throw a wobbly because things go a bit Chris Tavar\u00e9 for a day or two. This is the biscuit. The wheat revels in it, the chaff are all swiping right on their smartphones in a froth of existential dread. People who like this are people who like cricket. \u201cTold you soing is neither clever nor charming but Jeez did I call it on Brathwaite a couple of days ago (\u2018Recalcitrance is where he lives\u2019). Wish I\u2019d put the mortgage on the predictable git.\u201d 24th over: England 78-3 ( Lawrence 2, Stokes 2) Roach aims wide but neither Lawrence and Stokes can get full bat on ball. They\u2019re back out there and Roach has the ball in his hand. While we wait, here\u2019s some intriguing colour from Ali in Barbados: On day four the Barbados tourist board staged an exhibition of Road Tennis at lunch on a stage to the left of the media centre. Played on the ground - tarmac, asphalt or concrete - and using a 21 x 10ft court with an 8in \u2018net\u2019 made of wood, it originated in the 1930s when locals from the working class communities watched lawn tennis being enjoyed by the island\u2019s elite. They then procured some balls, began playing with their hands and a new code of the sport was spawned. Necessity is the mother of invention and soon these pioneers realised that by stripping the yellow felt from the tennis balls - leaving just the bouncy rubber inner - and using wooden paddles, they had a fast-paced game that was cheap and fun. The rules are similar to table tennis, with either singles or doubles and the aim to reach 21 points, with service alternating every five. These days there is a Barbados Road Tennis Association and a national tournament every year to coincide with the independence day celebrations on 30 November. The ministry of sport estimates there are over 1,000 players on the island, be it those who take it seriously or simply as a hobby, and there is growing ambition to one day see it feature in the Olympics. Road Tennis requires a strong core and fast reflexes, with players stooping throughout its rapid rallies. This demonstration was being staged at the Malcolm Marshall End of the ground and it is said that the legendary former fast bowler himself was a keen player back in the day, using it to keep up his fitness and hand-eye skills during the off-season. Brathwaite suggests England set 225; Finn laughs in his face: 260. The umpires are out, taking a peek. 23.2 overs: England 76-3 ( Lawrence 1, Stokes 1) Brathwaite switches his bowlers about as Roach is thrown the ball, but he only gets a couple of deliveries before the rain starts to fall and the covers are run on by groundsman in colourful rain gear. \u201cYour metaphor about too much accelerator before the engine perks up makes me wonder how long such language will last\u2019\u201d writes John Starbuck. \u201c As a driver of an EV for several years now I can foresee a time when explanations are going to be needed, when the engine doesn\u2019t have to be warmed up at all - it is there and ready always. Like using Cockney rhyming slang; the original references having long faded, I expect that, like playing cricket by the changing Laws across the decades, we shall just have to adapt.\u201d I did wonder that as I wrote it, even in relation to petrol cars. They don\u2019t seem to sit and have to warm up and be coaxed into action like they used to. 23rd over: England 76-3 ( Lawrence 1, Stokes 1) Joseph takes over from Holder and strikes with his third ball, his second pinged through the covers for a glorious four by Crawley. England have now lost three wickets in the first half hour of the day. Fab-u-lous catch by Seales, sprinting forwards and holding onto the catch by his boot laces as he thudded onto the turf, as Crawley launches into a pull. 22nd over: England 70-2 ( Crawley 36, Lawrence 1) The ball after Root polka-ed gaily down the pitch to whack Permaul back over his head for four, he is done by some overspin. England certainly going for quick runs here. Another slog-sweep, an ungainly hack which loops to Campbell at midwicket. 21st over: England 63-1 ( Crawley 33, Root 5) A miserly over by Holder until Crawley gets hold of the last ball and miscues a pull, top-edging one over the boundary. The ground staff, Ali reports, are poised by the covers. 20th over: England 58-1 ( Crawley 29, Root 4) Three fairly pedestrian singles off Permaul. New horizons for Chris Silverwood it seems, as the Sri Lankan men\u2019s team comes a-knocking. 19th over: England 55-1 ( Crawley 28, Root 2) Holder manages to extract some extra bounce which will catch Joe Root\u2019s eye, one ball squeaking off the top of Crawley\u2019s bat as he defends. Martyn Lester writes: \u201cYou quote Mark Butcher as saying that \u201cThe pitch is scared, it is broken up, it is worn away\u2026\u201d \u201cWhat \u2013 it\u2019s soiling itself? Quaking in its roots? Or was the word Butch actually uttered perhaps \u2019scarred\u2019?\u201d You\u2019ve got me. But a scared pitch might make for a more fruity final day. 18th over: England 53-1 ( Crawley 25, Root 2) Root is off the mark straight away with a squeeze towards third man. That wasn\u2019t a shot Lees will remember too fondly, putting his foot on the accelerator before the engine was perky. A slog sweep that falls flat. 17th over: England 50-0 (Lees 24, Crawley 25) West Indies hold onto a slip and a gully, while handing the ball to Jason Holder, who appears at the stumps like a sudden sandstorm over the horizon. Holder bowls wide and Lees waits, leans, and sends the ball spinning through cover point for four. A couple more and that\u2019s the fifty partnership from 101 balls - a fine starting stat to slip in the jacket pocket and riches indeed compared to a few months ago. \u201cI completely understand why people are finding this match boring,\u201d writes Robert Ellson, \u201cand the worries about the detrimental effects poor pitches have on the future of the game are completely valid. It\u2019s not a \u201cgood advert for Test cricket\u201d, as the saying goes. But does everything have to be an advert? Taking it on its own terms, there\u2019s been a lot to admire. Brathwaite\u2019s concentration was fantastic. Leach\u2019s perseverance similarly so. Stokes rising above the conditions on the second day was absolutely spectacular: a really great innings. It\u2019s certainly been a test of endurance for spectators, but part of Test cricket\u2019s infinite variety is that it\u2019s a test of endurance. I watched almost every ball yesterday, got up to make a cup of tea and missed Mahmood\u2019s first test wicket. I lost concentration just as Jason Holder did. If you struggled as a spectator (or an OBO reporter!) yesterday it gives you an ersatz experience of what the challenge is for the players. Would you want all Test matches to be like this? No. But nor would I want them all to be Iike the one in Chennai(?) last winter where it was such a dustbowl that Root took 5-6 and England were immediately 0-2 after three balls of spin in their innings (with the third being an overturned DRS decision!) But there\u2019s room in Test cricket\u2019s infinite variety for both kinds of game, and everything in between.\u201d Wise words indeed. 16th over: England 43-0 (Lees 18, Crawley 24) Permaul twists the ball from left hand to right and wheels in. A couple on the money then Crawley kneads one through the leg-side for a confidence-boosting three. A message arrives all the way from lovely Barbados. Over to you Craig Keeley - you lucky, lucky man! \u201cMorning everyone I know it\u2019s become standard to whinge about the pitch/captain/play during this Test but this is day five of my first ever overseas match (after 30 years of saying \u2018We\u2019re definitely going to the next one\u2019) and I\u2019ve pretty much been thrilled for every second of it. \u201cIt\u2019s Test cricket. Therefore it\u2019s fab. As Descartes once said. Also, I\u2019m sporting the same T-shirt/pants combo I was wearing at Headingly in 2019 so remain very very confident a miracle is about to happen.\u201d We heard it here first! Thanks Craig, enjoy every moment please have a rum punch for me. A reminder of Parkinson\u2019s ball of the century from last April. Just because. This, I think, is a call for Matt Parkinson, who spent 2020-21 carrying the drinks for England and is at risk of doing it again in the Caribbean. There have been a few showers in Barbados but, peering over David Gower\u2019s head, all seems back on track with the groundsman happily rolling the pitch again. So, what will Joe Root do? Put on his red-ball reset gambling gloves? Play it safe in hope of pushing for a result next week in Grenada - though rumours predict another batter\u2019s dream of a pitch. Discuss. Carlos Brathwaite says he\u2019d \u201cbowl wide to make England come after the ball, but play it safe.\u201d Steven Finn\u2019s view: \u201c I think England\u2019s plan is going to be to press on, push the game forward, they\u2019ve got 25 overs to get as many runs as they can if they want to give themselves a chance of bowling West Indies today.\u201d So. Mark Butcher is down at the pitch with his metaphorical car keys: \u201cThe pitch is scarred, it is broken up, it is worn away, however we still haven\u2019t see the ball spinning sharply on a regular basis. Also, bowling from the Malcolm Marshall end there are a couple of bare patches.\u201d We glance at run-chases down the year at Bridgetown - there have only ever been two successful chases over 200. So England, be bold! If you missed the overnight drama from Eden Park, here is Raf report of how England managed to limp to victory from the jaws of defeat. Hello and - ahem, wake up the at the back - welcome to the final day of the second Test between West Indies and England It\u2019s been... attritional. Kraigg Brathwaite\u2019s 710-minute innings of grunt and grind put him only behind Brian Lara\u2019s two record-breaking triple-quadruple hundreds in terms of balls at the crease; and there was precious little in it for England as they tasted the rare juices of the third new ball. But if the last two days have been akin to constantly being presented with a cup of tepid, mid-brown, medium-strength tea, here we have the chance of something a little more sparky. If Crawley and Lees (and the rest) can find some pizazz to stretch England\u2019s current lead of 136 to something more intimidating, and the pitch crumbles, and West Indies wobble - well, anything could happen. In the last Test West Indies were set 286 in 71 overs, and finished 147-4 - read whatever runes you like from that. See you here at 1:30pm GMT; play starts half an hour later.",

Their batters cared little for red ink, losing six wickets along the way as the West Indies outfielders held a succession of superb catches in the deep. Lawrence top scored with 41 from 39 balls, the No 4 repeating his role on the final day in Antigua and completing a strong overall performance after his 91 on the opening day. He and Bairstow cleared the ropes a couple of times apiece to the delight of the crowd, while all eight batters were wing-heeled between the wickets with the field spread. This was the first freewheeling session witnessed since Ben Stokes lit up the second day with his 128-ball 120, making way for a commendable assault on the West Indies lineup despite two of England\u2019s frontline bowlers \u2013 Chris Woakes and Matthew Fisher \u2013 being largely redundant due to conditions. On the rebuild in the Caribbean, England are putting much stock in qualities such as energy and selflessness. Hopes of a first victory of this chastening winter may have been thwarted by Brathwaite\u2019s hometown heroics but on these fronts they are at least meeting the brief.",

Steward managed to finish off a period of pressure for England\u2019s eighth try of the tournament \u2013 or third in matches not including Italy \u2013 and one of those, against Wales, should arguably not have counted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/20/rfu-encouraged-by-englands-six-nations-campaign-under-jones\">RFU \u2018encouraged\u2019 by England\u2019s Six Nations campaign under Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Had England\u2019s attack clicked into gear, produced anything like the kind of rhythm to match the rhetoric coming from Jones and his assistants, the avenues back into the side for Farrell would have seemed fewer. Ben Youngs\u2019s choice of word to describe how the attack has gone in practice \u2013 \u201cclunky\u201d \u2013 can often be an apt way of describing Farrell\u2019s performances when he is out of form but you sense Jones will waste little time in turning to the Saracen on the tour of Australia this summer.</p> <p>He is not everyone\u2019s cup of tea and whether he is given back the captaincy is a debate for another day but Jones would expect his return to bring clarity because there were several occasions on Saturday night when England players were almost caricatures of cluelessness. Certainly, French pressure and the intensity of the atmosphere played their part but there were times when Youngs, Marcus Smith and Henry Slade seemed overcome by confusion, overwhelmed by indecision. \u201cThe improvement in our attack has been very good, the only thing we have not been able to do is to finish,\u201d Jones said in one of his more obvious contradictions.</p> <p>Suffice to say, England\u2019s free, fluid formation has not been mastered. To again sum up the muddled thinking, Genge once more emptied himself but was as a result exhausted and came off second best at the scrum \u2013 an area of total English dominance the previous week against Ireland. To further illustrate, just look at how Jones used George Ford, the best kicking fly-half in England by a significant distance, throughout the tournament. Saturday was Smith\u2019s least effective performance in an England jersey. He was evidently instructed to hoist the ball high for Steward to chase and still managed to create a few openings, though there were errors too, as seen with an overcooked cross-field kick for Jamie George.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"df9799a4ce78b9e90ee75b65b210a51df5793291\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df9799a4ce78b9e90ee75b65b210a51df5793291/0_165_4888_2934/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Youngs kicks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Youngs said England have had many combinations and have not been fluid in attack.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fran\u00e7ois Mori/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Having hooked Smith early against Scotland, however, Jones was not prepared to do so again when Ford\u2019s kicking, not to mention his familiarity with Steward and Youngs, would have been welcome. Indeed, if Jones was willing to sacrifice Harry Randall\u2019s development temporarily in the interests of pragmatism with a recall for Youngs, why did the head coach not follow through and make a similar decision at fly-half?</p> <p>It seems odd to be criticising England for not playing with enough structure but to return to the free formation that Jones insists is not far away from clicking, there must now be considerable scepticism it ever will. For all that it sounds bold, like the kind of thing supporters want to hear, there is something delusional about it. A bit like trying to recreate the Sistine Chapel before mastering the art of painting by numbers first.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that at times it hasn\u2019t been as fluid as we\u2019d have liked, it\u2019s been a little clunky,\u201d Youngs said. \u201cAttack is the hardest part of the game \u2013 there are so many moving parts, different things. We\u2019ve had a number of different combinations. It needs to be fluid and we haven\u2019t had that. If I were to sum it up I would say that at times it\u2019s been a little bit clunky.\u201d</p> <p>It should also be noted that Warren Gatland had similarly grand designs with Wales before the penny dropped that his players needed structure and instruction from the coaches. There have been times during Jones\u2019s reign that he has appeared to have reached a similar conclusion and even taking into consideration his insistence that the game is changing for the quicker, you have to wonder why he has decided to chase the rainbow now. Equally, you wonder whether it is entirely coincidence that perhaps the player most comfortable with the fluidity Jones seeks is Joe Marchant, the only member of the squad to have played Super Rugby, a brief spell on loan in Auckland.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\">  <iframe id=\"the-breakdown\" name=\"the-breakdown\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-breakdown\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-breakdown\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Simon Amor was the fall guy 12 months ago and it remains to be seen whether his replacement as attack coach, Martin Gleeson, suffers a similar fate considering England\u2019s failure to cross the tryline regularly. Judging by the Rugby Football Union\u2019s endorsement of Jones\u2019s project on Sunday, that seems unlikely. But when the head coach urges fans to have faith, it feels like a big request. Patience is wearing thin, promises of progress increasingly ring hollow and nowhere is that as evident as with England\u2019s attack.</p>",

Had England\u2019s attack clicked into gear, produced anything like the kind of rhythm to match the rhetoric coming from Jones and his assistants, the avenues back into the side for Farrell would have seemed fewer. Ben Youngs\u2019s choice of word to describe how the attack has gone in practice \u2013 \u201cclunky\u201d \u2013 can often be an apt way of describing Farrell\u2019s performances when he is out of form but you sense Jones will waste little time in turning to the Saracen on the tour of Australia this summer. He is not everyone\u2019s cup of tea and whether he is given back the captaincy is a debate for another day but Jones would expect his return to bring clarity because there were several occasions on Saturday night when England players were almost caricatures of cluelessness. Certainly, French pressure and the intensity of the atmosphere played their part but there were times when Youngs, Marcus Smith and Henry Slade seemed overcome by confusion, overwhelmed by indecision. \u201cThe improvement in our attack has been very good, the only thing we have not been able to do is to finish,\u201d Jones said in one of his more obvious contradictions. Suffice to say, England\u2019s free, fluid formation has not been mastered. To again sum up the muddled thinking, Genge once more emptied himself but was as a result exhausted and came off second best at the scrum \u2013 an area of total English dominance the previous week against Ireland. To further illustrate, just look at how Jones used George Ford, the best kicking fly-half in England by a significant distance, throughout the tournament. Saturday was Smith\u2019s least effective performance in an England jersey. He was evidently instructed to hoist the ball high for Steward to chase and still managed to create a few openings, though there were errors too, as seen with an overcooked cross-field kick for Jamie George. Having hooked Smith early against Scotland, however, Jones was not prepared to do so again when Ford\u2019s kicking, not to mention his familiarity with Steward and Youngs, would have been welcome. Indeed, if Jones was willing to sacrifice Harry Randall\u2019s development temporarily in the interests of pragmatism with a recall for Youngs, why did the head coach not follow through and make a similar decision at fly-half? It seems odd to be criticising England for not playing with enough structure but to return to the free formation that Jones insists is not far away from clicking, there must now be considerable scepticism it ever will. For all that it sounds bold, like the kind of thing supporters want to hear, there is something delusional about it. A bit like trying to recreate the Sistine Chapel before mastering the art of painting by numbers first.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that at times it hasn\u2019t been as fluid as we\u2019d have liked, it\u2019s been a little clunky,\u201d Youngs said. \u201cAttack is the hardest part of the game \u2013 there are so many moving parts, different things. We\u2019ve had a number of different combinations. It needs to be fluid and we haven\u2019t had that. If I were to sum it up I would say that at times it\u2019s been a little bit clunky.\u201d It should also be noted that Warren Gatland had similarly grand designs with Wales before the penny dropped that his players needed structure and instruction from the coaches. There have been times during Jones\u2019s reign that he has appeared to have reached a similar conclusion and even taking into consideration his insistence that the game is changing for the quicker, you have to wonder why he has decided to chase the rainbow now. Equally, you wonder whether it is entirely coincidence that perhaps the player most comfortable with the fluidity Jones seeks is Joe Marchant, the only member of the squad to have played Super Rugby, a brief spell on loan in Auckland. Simon Amor was the fall guy 12 months ago and it remains to be seen whether his replacement as attack coach, Martin Gleeson, suffers a similar fate considering England\u2019s failure to cross the tryline regularly. Judging by the Rugby Football Union\u2019s endorsement of Jones\u2019s project on Sunday, that seems unlikely. But when the head coach urges fans to have faith, it feels like a big request. Patience is wearing thin, promises of progress increasingly ring hollow and nowhere is that as evident as with England\u2019s attack.",

How long did he have before he\u2019d need round-the-clock care? A year to 18 months. Long enough to get him through the two remaining episodes of this series, but what about the confirmed film sequel? Barring medical miracles, bang go theories that it will leapfrog forward five years to the second world war \u2013 unless it\u2019s without Tommy.</p> <p>We left him talking to the spirit of Aunt Polly (Helen McCrory): \u201cI\u2019m not a devil, just an ordinary mortal man \u2026 Just give me enough time to do what I have to do.\u201d A terminally ill man committing crimes to ensure his family\u2019s financial security after his death? Welcome to the Brummie Breaking Bad.</p> <h2>Ruby\u2019s funeral put father on warpath</h2> <p>A sombre opening sequence saw Charlie Strong (Ned Dennehy) open his salvage yard gates for Ruby\u2019s funeral. With its boats and horses, it was the seven-year-old\u2019s favourite place to play. The sight of a child-sized coffin made it all the more poignant. With visual echoes of episode one\u2019s send-off for Polly, the 10-minute scene was beautifully shot by director Anthony Byrne \u2013 all bluey-grey filters and eerie morning mist, every frame like a painting.</p> <p>An emotional Tommy asked big bruv Arthur (Paul Anderson) to read the eulogy but he was too bowed and broken. Perhaps no bad thing. Remember series three\u2019s disastrous best man\u2019s speech? \u201cThe devils who did this will pay, Ruby,\u201d vowed her father, striding away from his distraught wife, Lizzie (Natasha O\u2019Keeffe, excellent again) on a revenge mission.</p> <p>Cut to him striding into a woodland Gypsy camp, declaring that he was there on behalf of the blue sapphire before coldly gunning down Evadne Barwell (Gwynne McElveen), along with three male campmates. It was Barwell who\u2019d put a hex on Ruby in revenge for the cursed Russian gem killing her own daughter. Would payback make Tommy feel better? Not really. He smashed his rifle against a tree and fell tearfully to his knees.</p> <p>His hitman act hardly endeared him to Lizzie, either. Despite Tommy\u2019s promises about becoming a better man, he dealt with grief by throwing himself into work and firing guns in fury. His horse, Grace\u2019s Secret, provided poor Lizzie with more comfort.</p> <h2>\u2018A daughter lost, a son found\u2019</h2> <p>It was sister-in-law Esme Shelby-Lee (Aimee-Ffion Edwards) who tracked down the wild Barwell tribe on Tommy\u2019s behalf. When he delivered Esme\u2019s payment, she dropped another bombshell. Tommy slept with a girl called Zelda in May 1914, two months before he left for the Great War, and fathered a son he never knew he had: the nobly named Duke, now in his late teens and a thief (attaboy) who works at fairgrounds.</p> <p>No fairytale reunion here. Tommy was in no fit state and ain\u2019t that type of guy. But we can expect light-fingered Duke Shelby to play a bigger part over the next fortnight. He wants more from life than big wheels and carousels. He could be about to get it.</p> <h2>Guess who\u2019s coming for dinner?</h2> <p>Last week saw power-brokers invited to Tommy\u2019s house to discuss the new world order. Despite it being four days since Ruby\u2019s death, this secret summit went ahead. Oswald Mosley (Sam Claflin) and Diana Mitford (Amber Anderson) were first down the driveway, followed by IRA leader Laura McKee (Charlene McKenna) and finally cigar-puffing Boston mob boss Jack Nelson (James Frecheville).</p> <p>While they waited for Tommy, Diana Mitford boasted about attending a similar gathering in Berlin with G\u00f6ring, Himmler and Hitler himself \u2013 after which the entertainment was to watch Jews being humiliatingly force-fed grass. Despicable Di\u2019s comeuppance can\u2019t arrive quick enough.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f2fb927db81c36c9c3a033c1dfe7c320b4e21423\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2fb927db81c36c9c3a033c1dfe7c320b4e21423/0_126_3966_2380/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oswald Mosley and Diana Mitford, played by Sam Claflin and Amber Anderson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oswald Mosley and Diana Mitford, played by Sam Claflin and Amber Anderson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC/Caryn Mandabach Productions Ltd.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Tommy emerged, Mitford made eyes at him once again. The message for Uncle Jack Nelson to relay to President Roosevelt was that Mosley could be a bulwark against communist insurgency. England was on the brink of fascism. McKee said working-class Irish republicans only needed a nudge to turn the same way. But did Labour MP Tommy truly believe in \u201cthe cause\u201d? Face like thunder and the words sticking in his throat, he joined Mosley in a \u201cPerish Judah\u201d salute to prove his commitment. Chilling, even in a drama set 90 years ago.</p> <p>It did the trick. Nelson declared Boston open for the export of weapons to the IRA and the import of Tommy\u2019s drugs. The shadowy meeting, with its sidelong looks and spinning cameras, was adjourned.</p> <h2>Gruesome twosome</h2> <p>In Westminster, the phone was ringing off the hook. Tommy had spies at the flat that Mosley uses to conduct affairs and they came up trumps. Mosley was enthusiastically in flagrante with Michael\u2019s wife, Gina, (Anya Taylor-Joy). So much for her talk of trust and fidelity.</p> <p>Once Mosley left, Tommy barged in to let Gina know he now had leverage. In return for not telling Jack or Michael, Tommy ordered Gina to be his spy in Berlin when Mosley met senior members of the German government. When he asked Michael\u2019s true intentions towards him, Gina lied that her husband was strictly about the Boston deal. Tommy smiled. Yeah, right.</p> <h2>Fascists outside and in</h2> <p>Relieved of stand-in boss duties, sister Ada (Sophie Rundle) was putting daughter Elizabeth to bed when a racist threat came through the window, tied to a brick. She fearlessly confronted fascist thugs outside her Mayfair home, dispersing them with a knee to the groin and the wave of her gun.</p> <p>Safely back inside, she was shocked to realise that teen son Karl (Callum Booth-Ford) was a trainee racist, too. He sneered that his mixed-race baby sister \u2013 fathered by Col Ben Younger (Kingsley Ben-Adir) last series before he was blown up in a car bomb \u2013 would \u201cget them killed\u201d and be \u201csent back to Africa\u201d.</p> <p>Ada gave him pleasingly short shrift, reminding Karl that he had Gypsy blood. What\u2019s more, he was half-Jewish. His late father, Freddie Thorne (played by Israel-born actor Iddo Goldberg in series one), was the son of a Jewish tailor who\u2019d westernised his surname. A sobering illustration of the pernicious rise of far-right radicalisation and the lazy ignorance of bigots.</p> <h2>Brotherly bonding did no good</h2> <p>Down in Tommy\u2019s cellar, alone in the dark, was Arthur, still struggling with opium withdrawal. When Tommy went down to join his brother-in-arms, it was as if they were tunnellers beneath no man\u2019s land again. The nostalgic mood continued as they exchanged childhood reminiscences, albeit mainly about fighting.</p> <p>The sweet scene between the siblings momentarily looked like it might ease both their troubles. \u201cYou\u2019ll change your ways and I\u2019ll change the fucking world,\u201d said Tommy, shaking hands and falling off the wagon with a swig of red wine to seal the deal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"144e63820f134e0a98fcfe7b59ca3424da7302d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/144e63820f134e0a98fcfe7b59ca3424da7302d6/0_0_4285_2571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brothers at arm\u2019s length \u2026 Arthur (Paul Anderson) and Tommy \u2026\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brothers at arm\u2019s length \u2026 Arthur (Paul Anderson) and Tommy \u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC/Caryn Mandabach Productions Ltd.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hopes for a clean and serene Arthur renaissance proved equally in vain. He was soon tearing apart Chinatown opium dens, which had been ordered not to sell to him any more, before slumping in an alley with fistfuls of junk. Come back to us, Arthur. Tommy needs you. Viewers need you.</p> <h2>Line of the week</h2> <p>Plenty of serious stuff this episode, but there was some welcome light relief. When monstrous Mitford horrified fellow guests with that grim anecdote, Mosley snorted with mirth and indulgently replied: \u201cOh Diana, you\u2019ve killed the mood.\u201d You can say that again.</p> <h2>Anachronistic soundtrack-spotting</h2> <p>The most musical episode of the series so far began with a pair of plaintive Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor ballads, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gTppAHVy28\">In This Heart</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QmaKIDoTk8\">Lullaby For Cain</a>. But tune of the week goes to Irish folk singer Lisa O\u2019Neill\u2019s Blackbird, which segued hauntingly out of Charlene McKenna\u2019s rendition of The Black Velvet Band.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkm0vBEQT8Q\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zkm0vBEQT8Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>Notes and observations</h2> <ul> <li><p>We only glimpsed him fleetingly, but new arrival Duke is played by Conrad Khan, who previously appeared in BBC One stablemate Baptiste.

A sobering illustration of the pernicious rise of far-right radicalisation and the lazy ignorance of bigots. Brotherly bonding did no good Down in Tommy\u2019s cellar, alone in the dark, was Arthur, still struggling with opium withdrawal. When Tommy went down to join his brother-in-arms, it was as if they were tunnellers beneath no man\u2019s land again. The nostalgic mood continued as they exchanged childhood reminiscences, albeit mainly about fighting. The sweet scene between the siblings momentarily looked like it might ease both their troubles. \u201cYou\u2019ll change your ways and I\u2019ll change the fucking world,\u201d said Tommy, shaking hands and falling off the wagon with a swig of red wine to seal the deal. Hopes for a clean and serene Arthur renaissance proved equally in vain. He was soon tearing apart Chinatown opium dens, which had been ordered not to sell to him any more, before slumping in an alley with fistfuls of junk. Come back to us, Arthur. Tommy needs you. Viewers need you. Line of the week Plenty of serious stuff this episode, but there was some welcome light relief. When monstrous Mitford horrified fellow guests with that grim anecdote, Mosley snorted with mirth and indulgently replied: \u201cOh Diana, you\u2019ve killed the mood.\u201d You can say that again. Anachronistic soundtrack-spotting The most musical episode of the series so far began with a pair of plaintive Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor ballads, In This Heart and Lullaby For Cain. But tune of the week goes to Irish folk singer Lisa O\u2019Neill\u2019s Blackbird, which segued hauntingly out of Charlene McKenna\u2019s rendition of The Black Velvet Band. Notes and observations We only glimpsed him fleetingly, but new arrival Duke is played by Conrad Khan, who previously appeared in BBC One stablemate Baptiste. His performance in the 2019 film County Lines earned him a Bafta rising star nomination. Always reassuring to see Frances (Pauline Turner), Tommy\u2019s loyal housekeeper for three series now. If she falls, the Shelbys fall. Doctor-and-patient Aneurin Barnard and Cillian Murphy previously appeared together in Christopher Nolan\u2019s Dunkirk. By order of the Peaky Blinders, please share your medical second opinions, Duke thoughts and home stretch theories below \u2026",

Ninth. Xavi replaced Ronald Koeman a couple of weeks later, and since the turn of the year Barcelona have been in blistering form. Their <em>geriatricos</em> and future <em>galacticos</em> are getting on famously. But this is their biggest test yet.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for tonight\u2019s blog. I\u2019ll leave you with Sid Lowe\u2019s match report - goodnight! Peep peep! It\u2019s a famous night for Xavi\u2019s resurgent Barcelona. They have hammered Real Madrid 4-0 at the Bernabeu, and it would have been more but for Thibaut Courtois. Real, without Karim Benzema, were fifty shades of shambles, but Barcelona shouldn\u2019t care about that. They scored some fine goals, two from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, and confirmed their status as the form team in Spain. More to the point, they won 4-0 at the Bernabeu! 88 min Lucas Vazquez and Nico Gonzalez are both booked for fouls in the space of a few seconds. 86 min Two changes for Barcelona: Dani Alves and Nico Gonzalez replace Pedri and Jordi Alba. 85 min Lucas Vazquez misses a decent chance, slapping a bouncing ball over the bar. 84 min \u201cThe fifth goal,\u201d says Phil Podolsky, \u201cshould be scored by a sub no one\u2019s ever heard of or will hear of again!\u201d I\u2019m disappointed to see he didn\u2019t end up at Stoke. 83 min Valverde shoots over from distance. 82 min Camavinga is booked for a robust challenge on Busquets. He got the ball but sent Busquets up in the air as well. 80 min A change for Barcelona: Adama Traore replaces Ousmane Dembele, who made both goals in the first half. 79 min A fierce shot from a tight angle by Alaba is shovelled away by ter Stegen. 79 min \u201cIs this simply a lack of confidence for Real Madrid\u2019s playing without their talisman or is this the kinda squad Chelsea can dispatch as easy as last year?\u201d asks Rob Coughlin. I think Chelsea will beat them easily again, with or without Benzema. 78 min A snap-volley from Memphis is well saved by Courtois, diving to his right. 77 min Asensio shoots over from Alaba\u2019s cutback. A half chance at best. 76 min Barcelona still look hungry for more goals, which is no surprise given how many famous 5-0 wins there have been in this fixture. 75 min Jordi Alba is booked for a lunging tackle on Vinicius. 73 min It should be 5-0. The hapless Eder Militao diverts Memphis\u2019s pass to Dembele, who beats Militao again before dragging a shot wide from 12 yards. 72 min \u201cArsenal,\u201d says Charles Antaki, \u201care looking for a striker.\u201d 71 min No hat-trick for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. He is going off, as is Frenkie de Jong. They\u2019re replaced by Gavi and Memphis. 69 min This result means that Madrid are nine points clear with nine games to go. They\u2019ll surely end up as champions, but this has been a seriously chastening night. 65 min Vinicius has a shot blocked by Araujo. 64 min Courtois flies to his right to repel a rasping shot on the run from Ferran Torres. This is ridiculous; Courtois has been Real\u2019s best player and they\u2019re 4-0 down. 64 min Carlo Ancelotti moves a couple more deckchairs: Nacho and Rodrygo are replaced by Lucas Vazquez and Marco Asensio. 63 min Modric is booked for a bad foul on Dembele. 61 min Another chance for Aubameyang, who shoots tamely at Courtois after a header down from de Jong. He could have scored five goals tonight. 61 min Rodrygo makes a bit of space in the area but shoots straight at ter Stegen. I can\u2019t quite believe this scoreline. 60 min \u201cHi there Rob,\u201d says Max Ferrer. \u201cRegarding James Bolle\u2019s kit comment, it should be noted that this is Bar\u00e7a\u2019s fourth kit this season. Why wear the fourth when none of the first three would have clashed with black? Perhaps because it\u2019s the kit featuring the Senyera, the \u2018national\u2019 flag of Catalunya. As the team of the anti-Catalan dictator Francisco Franco, Madrid seem like the perfect opponents against which to wear the region\u2019s flag. I can\u2019t say whether or not El Cl\u00e1sico is dead, but perhaps regional spite and Catalan pride aren\u2019t.\u201d 58 min Aubameyang misses a wonderful chance for a hat-trick! Jordi Alba played a one-two with Torres and curled a superb low cross to the far post. Aubameyang met it on the run but sliced his shot wide. 57 min It\u2019s Real Madrid 0-4 Barcelona. 56 min We\u2019ve just seen a replay of the fourth goal, and it turns out Torres was being played onside by Alaba on the other side of the pitch. 55 min Here\u2019s the third goal. It\u2019s 4-0! This is unreal. Pique drove a long pass to Torres, who looked slightly offside but apparently wasn\u2019t. He played a short pass through to Aubameyang, who lifted the ball lazily over Courtois. Real players are angry, saying they stopped because the assistant referee put the flag up. Either way, it went to VAR and the goal was given. Barcelona, who have lost the last five clasicos, are 4-0 up at the Bernabeu! VAR check - this goal might be given you know. 52 min Aubameyang has a goal disallowed for offside against Torres in the build up. Real Madrid are all over the show; it\u2019s remarkable. 47 min So much ha happened at the start of the second half that I haven\u2019t had chance to tell you about a double substitution that Real made during the interval. Eduardo Camavinga and Mariano Diaz came on for Dani Carvajal and Toni Kroos. He\u2019s scored this time! This is incredible! Barcelona have cut Real apart so easily. Frenkie de Jong played a one-two with Dembele and then found Aubameyang on the edge of the area. It was two against one, and Aubameyang had so much time to flick the ball across to Torres. This time he finished with aplomb, sweeping the ball high into the net. 46 min Torres misses a great chance inthe first 30 seconds of the second half. He ran through from the halfway line, drew Courtois but then curled his shot wide of the far post. 46 min Peep peep! Real begin the second half. Peep peep! Barcelona are in control after a startling first half at the Bernabeu. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Ronald Araujo scored with accomplished headers from crosses by Ousmane Dembele. Barcelona were good but Madrid have been desperate. See you in 10 minutes for the second half. 44 min Barcelona probably can\u2019t believe how easy this has been. They almost get a third when Jordi Alba\u2019s looping header across goal just evades Aubameyang. 41 min I think Real have switched to 4-3-3, with Valverde on the right, Vinicius left and Rodrygo up front. They\u2019ve got a job on now, though, because Barcelona are in complete control. 40 min \u201cAre both teams in their away kits?\u201d says James Bolle. \u201cEl Clasico\u2019s gone.\u201d Real\u2019s excuse is that it\u2019s a limited-edition kit for their 120th anniversary. It\u2019s two! Dembele curls a right-wing corner onto the head of Ronald Araujo, who tenses his neck muscles to thump a downward header past Courtois. 37 min Dembele has a shot blocked by Nacho. 36 min: Vinicius Jr misses an excellent chance! It was a devastating counter-attack from Madrid, with Vinicius eventually put through on goal. He overran the ball just slightly, which allowed ter Stegen to come out and narrow the angle. Vinicius went round ter Stegen and then fell over appealing for a penalty. There was nothing in it. 35 min Aubameyang almost gets his second! Garcia drove a marvellous 60-yard pass to find de Jong in all sorts of space. He moved the ball left to Aubameyang, whose shot was saved a little awkwardly by Courtois. 34 min Here\u2019s the Aubameyang goal. 33 min Real Madrid have been pretty awful so far. I\u2019m surprised Carlo Ancelotti hasn\u2019t changed something, anything, even just a switch to 4-3-3 until half-time. 31 min Busquets is booked for a brazen attempt to pull Eder Militao back. A deserved lead for Barcelona! Dembele beats Nacho with ease on the right and lifts a good cross to the near post, where Aubameyang gets in front of Eder Militao and flicks an accomplished header into the bottom corner. That\u2019s an excellent goal. 29 min It\u2019s still all Barcelona. Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s funky formation really hasn\u2019t worked. 27 min Jordi Alba is down after being poked in the eye by Valverde. It was an accident and Alba accepts Valverde\u2019s apology. 26 min Frenkie de Jong is booked for a foul on Kroos. 24 min Pedri swaggers away from Eder Militao and scoops a gorgeous pass over the top to Torres, whose shot is crucially blocked by Casemiro. 24 min Karim Benzema is having a stormer. 22 min Kroos is booked for a perceived foul on Busquets. 22 min Tiki taka tiki taka tiki taka tiki taka tiki taka tiki taka tiki taka tiki taka tiki taka. Barcelona are really dominating possession. 21 min Rodrygo walks away from Pedri and rakes a shot that is blocked on the edge of the area, I think by Garcia. 18 min A loose ball falls kindly for Torres, 25 yards out. He uses Carvajal as a screen and shapes a beautiful curling shot that flies just wide of the far post. Barcelona are looking dangerous. 16 min It\u2019s an interesting contest, this. Barcelona are playing like the home side, with Real happy to use the pace of Vinicius and Rodrygo on the break. 14 min At the other end, Vinicius cuts inside Araujo and shoots straight at ter Stegen from the edge of the area. 12 min: Double save from Courtois! Barcelona should be ahead. Torres got away from Carvajal and crosses low to Aubameyang, whose unconvincing shot is beaten away by Courtois. Dembele collects the loose ball and hits a curling shot that is pushed away dramatically by Courtois. Aubameyang\u2019s was by some distance the better chance. 11 min Aubameyang is late on Kroos, who goes down holding his knee. He\u2019s a bit lucky to avoid a yellow card for that. 9 min Modric is still playing as a false nine, with Valverde supporting him a lot of the time. It\u2019s a really unusual system, essentially a diamond midfield with two wide forwards and no striker. 7 min Vinicius twists Araujo inside out on the left of the area but has to wait for support. Eventually he plays the ball to Valverde, who slides a low shot from the edge of the area that is pushed behind by the diving ter Stegen. Good save. 5 min Valverde zooms through midfield and finds Rodrygo to his right. He runs at Jordi Alba and spanks a shot that swerves wide of the near post. 4 min \u201cI was wondering how many names I would recognise from the Barcelona lineup,\u201d says Charles Antaki. \u201cLo and behold our old friends Gerard Piqu\u00e9 and Sergio Busquets are still happily ensconced, and even Jordi Alba, who spent some time in the wilderness, is back on the pitch. But Pierre Emerick Aubameyang? Still hard to come to terms with. But the move seems to have suited him, so the best of luck to him. Xavi\u2019s new army, indeed.\u201d 3 min Lots of early possession for Barcelona. I\u2019m trying to work out the Madrid system - at the moment it looks like Modric is playing as a false nine. I didn\u2019t see that coming. Vinicius Jr and Rodrygo have started very wide, so there\u2019s no orthodox centre forward. 2 min \u201cRight,\u201d says Matt Dony. Just endured a surprisingly tense and horrible 90 minutes, where I couldn\u2019t relax until the final whistle blew. Now I\u2019m looking forward to hopefully relaxing and seeing Barcelona given a Mes Que Un Clubbing. There\u2019s just something about them. I might hate them more than any club in the Premier League. Hala Madrid.\u201d 1 min Peep peep! A few minutes later than advertised, the clasico is under way. In other rivalry news The players are ready for action. It\u2019s a pleasantly cool night in Madrid, and things are about to get lively. This never gets old \u201cIt\u2019s weird to be watching El Cl\u00e1sico in the spring with as much riding on the outcome as, say, Wolves v Villa,\u201d writes K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cYes, it might have an effect on who gets into the Champions League next year, and it\u2019s a grand old fixture with a venerable history. But I\u2019m having trouble remembering a match between Real Madrid and Barcelona where the outcome would have so little to say about who\u2019d win the league. Maybe spring 2013? I\u2019ll still watch, of course, even if it\u2019s El Meaninglesso.\u201d A reminder of the teams Real Madrid (possible 4-D-2) Courtois; Carvajal, Eder Militao, Alaba, Nacho; Casemiro; Valverde, Kroos; Modric; Rodrygo, Vinicius Jr. Substitutes: Lunin, Diego Pineiro, Vallejo, Hazard, Asensio, Marcelo, Jovic, Lucas V, Ceballos, Isco, Mariano, Camavinga. Barcelona (4-1-2-3) ter Stegen; Araujo, Pique, Garcia, Jordi Alba; Busquets; F de Jong, Pedri; Dembele, Aubameyang, Ferran Torres. Substitutes: Riqui Puig, Dani Alves, Memphis, Gavi, Mingueza, Traore, Braithwaite, Neto, Nico, Lenglet, L de Jong, Arnau Tenas. The early evening game has finished Sevilla 0-0 Real Sociedad. That means, if they win tonight, Real will go 12 points clear with nine games remaining. A Barcelona victory would move them to within three points of second-placed Sevilla. Sid Lowe\u2019s match preview is really good. Of course it is; Sid Lowe wrote it. Rodrygo has the thankless task of replacing the injured Karim Benzema. We don\u2019t know yet whether Real will play 4-3-3 or a diamond with Rodrygo and Vinicius Jr as split strikers. Ousmane Dembele starts ahead of Adama Traore for Barcelona, while Ronald Araujo is preferred to Dani Alves at right-back. Marsellus Wallace never played in no clasico. Even when the game is relatively meaningless \u2013 Real are going to win the league - pride is of the essence. This is Real Madrid v Barcelona, a fixture that speaks so profoundly for itself so profoundly that I\u2019m sorely tempted to break the unwritten rule that a man in his forties should never use the phrase \u201cnuff said\u201d. We\u2019re still a long way from the golden age of the early 2010s, but this game waters the mouth more than recent clasicos. That\u2019s mainly because of Barcelona\u2019s resurgence and the growing feeling that they will be soon be ready to compete for big trophies again. When they lost at home to Real in October they were ninth. Ninth. Xavi replaced Ronald Koeman a couple of weeks later, and since the turn of the year Barcelona have been in blistering form. Their geriatricos and future galacticos are getting on famously. But this is their biggest test yet. Madrid, the best team in Spain by a distance this season, and on a run of five straight clasico victories, would love to remind them what\u2019s what. Kick off 8pm in London, 9pm in Madrid.",

But at this level, after already having so much information with engines and stuff, it shouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d Having won last season\u2019s title on the final lap of the final race against Hamilton, taking the championship by just seven points, he was aware of how vital every one might be in what may yet be a three-way fight between Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes. \u201cIt is just disappointing, you always say to yourself and to the team: \u2018We have to score points, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s first or second in the first race,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cTo lose so many points for the team is also very disappointing, because for the championship where sometimes it can be really tight until the end these are very important points.\u201d For Hamilton and his teammate George Russell, who secured fourth, the points were more than they had expected having been well off the pace of both Ferrari and Red Bull in the race. The seven-time champion acknowledged they may prove vital and that while they had needed some good fortune he also noted they had battled hard to stay in a position to take advantage should anything untoward happen as was the case. \u201cEvery point can make a difference, I have lost world titles with just one point,\u201d he said. \u201cWhilst we are currently not necessarily performance-wise fighting with these guys, this is not damage limitation but it\u2019s a really, really great result. Of course we are fortunate but ultimately we have done a better job. We have had better reliability. I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s luck, it is everyone\u2019s hard work. \u201cIt\u2019s such a long season, it is going to be such a hard battle but we love a challenge. I really do enjoy a challenge. There is no greater feeling when you all come together and get a result like this. We have had better reliability.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Bronze medals for Lorraine Ugen and Marc Scott spared Britain\u2019s blushes on the final day of the world indoor championships \u2013 but they still endured their worst result in the competition since 2006. On a day when Mondo Duplantis broke his own pole vault world record by flying over 6.20m, and the Venezuelan Yulimar Rojas did the same in the triple jump with an astonishing 15.74m leap, Britain\u2019s celebrations were more muted as they left Belgrade with two medals. Only twice in history \u2013 1987 and 2006 \u2013 have Britain come away with fewer medals from a world indoors. But at least Ugen was smiling after her brilliant bronze, which was particularly noteworthy as the 30-year-old is an unsponsored athlete. Ugen, who has set up her own company, Unsigned, and sported the logo on her shoes to earn extra money, jumped 6.82m to finish in third behind the gold medallist, Ivana Vuleta of Serbia, who delighted the home crowd with a leap of 7.06m to beat Nigeria\u2019s Ese Brume into second. \u201cOne of the reasons I started Unsigned was to make it less shameful when you don\u2019t have a sponsor,\u201d Ugen said. \u201cI\u2019m world class, I don\u2019t have a sponsor and if anyone is out there, I\u2019m here.\u201d Scott, meanwhile, showed plenty of poise \u2013 and when the situation called for it a lot of pace \u2013 to win his first global medal in the men\u2019s 3,000m. In a bumpy race, Scott maintained his composure as the Kenyan and Ethiopian athletes duked it out in front of him before kicking hard on the final lap to sneak a bronze in a time of 7min 42.02sec. \u201cThe race was choppy and bruising but that\u2019s the way it goes,\u201d Scott said after a race won by Selemon Barega. \u201cI have blood on my shin, but I can\u2019t feel that now. I\u2019m sure I will later when all this sinks in. The pain is worth it to come away with a medal.\u201d Despite a better final day it was a disappointing championship for Britain. Some will blame the absence of some notable stars \u2013 Laura Muir has been injured and Dina Asher\u2011Smith skipped the indoor season \u2013 although that is usually the case. Others will point to the bad luck the team had, and there is some truth to that, too. Keely Hodgkinson, a strong favourite for the gold in the women\u2019s 800m, and Elliot Giles, who had his chances in the men\u2019s event, pulled out minutes before they were due to compete. But this performance \u2013 coming off the back of a disappointing Olympics, where Britain won only five medals in athletics \u2013 will sound further alarm bells about the lack of depth. Elsewhere on the final day the American Grant Holloway won his 57th indoor 60m hurdles race in a row to take gold in 7.39sec, having earlier equalled his own world record. Britain\u2019s David King was sixth in the same race in 7.62, having qualified for the final in unique circumstances. He and the Japanese athlete Shusei Nomoto were tied for the final spot in the final, down to a thousandth of a second: 7.565 to 7.565. It meant that both names were put into a bag \u2013 with King\u2019s name being drawn out. \u201cIt\u2019s been a crazy day and a rollercoaster of emotions but I\u2019m super happy to come out with luck on my side,\u201d King said. \u201cI would have taken sixth in the world and a PB in the semis every day of the week.\u201d But there was no joy for Britain\u2019s men\u2019s 4x400m relay as they finished fifth in a race won by Belgium and the women\u2019s team were also fifth, with Jamaica the victors, in their final. In the women\u2019s 800m, the American Ajee Wilson took full advantage of Hodgkinson\u2019s absence to take a deserved gold. But there was a shock in the men\u2019s 1500m as the Olympic champion, Jakob Ingebrigtsen, was downed by the Ethiopian Samuel Tefera. In the men\u2019s pole vault, Duplantis broke his own world record for the second time in a fortnight with a leap that suggested that even more is to come in the summer.

A tie of historic significance, a trip down memory lane will decide it. It\u2019s not since the last century, 1999, that Forest and Liverpool faced each other and by then the rivalry of the late-1970s/early-1980s and a less heated revival at the end of the 1980s was a distant memory, even if Liverpool were in the doldrums themselves by 1999. The modern Forest are in the hunt for promotion, but their cup run has seized the imagination and the agenda for now. The Liverpool of 2022 are meanwhile going for the type of quadruple that even the teams of the 1980s would have thought beyond their ken. J\u00fcrgen Klopp seems to have decided the cups are worth going for; that wasn\u2019t always the case. The City Ground awaits, a stadium where a visit does conjure memories of glories past, mostly because the place has barely changed in many years. And to draw this preamble to an end, you will notice that we have not actually mentioned his name until the very end: Brian Clough. </p> <p><strong>Kick-off at 6pm UK time.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Ben Fisher\u2019s report from the City Ground. Liverpool are in their 25th FA Cup semi-final, though they have not been in the final since 2012, and they last won the competition in 2006. Wembley hasn\u2019t really been Anfield South in recent years, but the League Cup and now that date next month with City, those days might be coming back soon. Diogo Jota speaks to ITV after the game. It was a tough game they are a great team, they played with a lot of intensity. [Offside goal] Yeah, I thought it was tight, you never know. They had one big, big, chance and they gave us a proper challenge. It was a really tough game but we are in the semi-final;. We fought, we fought really hard. This was the moment that swung it, though there were others, too. Forest fans will rue the missed chances and perhaps the penalty that never was. A match befitting of the occasion of 23 years apart, some real effort by Forest, Liverpool given a fright as they go through to face Manchester City in the semi-final. The FA Cup has been very good this season, and now the biggest guns will be in the last four. And Crystal Palace. Forest gave everything, but Liverpool\u2019s quality told, and Jurgen Klopp is congratulating Forest players on their efforts. 90+5 min: Just a few seconds away from Wembley for Liverpool now... 90+3 min: That penalty, that miss from Zinckernagel, the Yates header just now, Forest have had their chances. And there will be post-match rage about the non-penalty. Tinfoil hats aplenty....but what\u2019s this? Cafu has one, the ball dropping down, his control perfect, his shot just wide. Not bad for a 51-year-old.... 90+1 min: Liverpool trying to kill this one off by wasting time, there\u2019s been a few scares for them on the way to this narrow lead. 90 min: On ITV, the rarity of a losing player getting man of the match as Lee Dixon chooses Forest\u2019s Joe Worrall, who has given everything for the cause. Five minutes added on. 89 min: Forest go again, and Johnson skips to the wing, with four waiting in the middle. Yates gets on the end of it but the header is straight at Alisson. 87 min: Van Dijk is down after a clash with Cafu. He\u2019ll be OK but Liverpool will be taking their time. 85 min: There\u2019s a penalty shout...Yates skates past Alisson and goes down. There\u2019s calls for VAR, and it looks as if he deliberately leaves his boot to be hit. It\u2019s waved on by the referee. Could Yates have kept going? We\u2019ll never know. 84 min: Surridge, on as sub, is pulled back by Kounate. Liverpool still not finding this at all easy. 83 min: But: a free-kick for Forest, James Garner will take, and the ball is smuggled away by Jota, the match-winner as it stands. Forest are not going to take this lying down. 80 min: Poor Zinckernagel had to watch that from the subs bench as he was replaced by Mighten. Liverpool found a way, with Tsimikas, unable to find a pass all day, releasing the previously quiet Jota. That\u2019s so tough on Forest. Tsimikas cuts in, and bends his pass, Jota bends his run and knocks in. There\u2019s a delay for VAR and a hint of offside but that was cruel on Forest. So close to that Zinckernagel miss. 76 min: Oh no, that was the one. Lovely ball finds Johnson in space and it\u2019s there to be hit for Zinckernagel. And he does hit it, but wide. Oh no, what a miss. 75 min: Van Dijk smashes out of play as Davis threatens him. The gliding Dutchman has not found it easy against the former Villa man. Not at all. 73 min: Oof, the glimmer of a chance as Johnson robs Tsimikas and the ball is there to be crossed. It ends up in Alisson\u2019s arms but Liverpool have lacked a bit of fluency after all those changes, memories of Sven Goran Eriksson swapping out half a team and his teams looking disjointed. 71 min: The sight of Thiago strolling and the no-look pass is amidst us, and mesmeric. Except, his next touch is to almost play in Keinan Davis. That\u2019s a blow to his passing stats. 70 min: Forest are trying to win this in the 90, too. It\u2019s been a fine game despite a lack of goalmouth action. At one end, Luis Diaz makes a pretty theatrical dive and escapes what might have been a yellow. 68 min: Firmino\u2019s pass almost sets up Luis Diaz for a goal with his first touch but the ball runs beyond him. At the other end, Van Dijk has to wake up and stop Brennan Johnson getting a shot in. 66 min: Liverpool\u2019s team looks distinctly stronger with that quartet added. Looks like Jurgen Klopp wants to avoid extra time, it seems. 64 min: Here come four Liverpool subs (count \u2018em). Oxlade-Chamberlain goes off, looking annoyed, so does Elliott, on come Diaz and Minamo. Thiago replaces Fabinho. Keita off for Henderson. Forest make one change: off goes Lolley, and on comes Cafu, the Brazilian legend.... 62 min: Van Dijk and Davis is turning into something of a battle. The Forest forward is a handful. 60 min: Johnson is climbed all over by Gomez. It looked clumsy and it was also deliberate, so Gomez is rightfully booked. A free-kick to be bent in by Garner from the left-hand side? No, it comes to Zinckernagel who can\u2019t beat Alisson\u2019s wingspan. 58 min: Johnathan Kaszynski: \u201cI really feel for Oxlade-Chamberlain. His career was finally coming together and he just hasn\u2019t recovered from that injury. Unfortunately this is not his level anymore.\u201d It\u2019s true he\u2019s never recovered the form he showed during that 2018 run in the Champions League. And that feels a long time ago now. 57 min: Joe Gomez wins a corner for Liverpool, and Tsimikas takes - of course - Van Dijk hooks it back in, and Horvath clears as Kounate climbs to reach the ball. 55 min: Garner steps up to clear some danger. This tie is on something of an edge. Liverpool have struggled without being anything like overpowered. Forest are seeking that one chance to find a way past. 53 min: A chance soon comes, Jota getting a whiff of one and Horvath saves well, just as he does Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s ball deflects into his path. Liverpool stepping it up now? It seems so. 52 min: Spence forces a corner, and the Forest fans really get behind their men. They get a throw when Tsimikas heads away. Liverpool yet to get into the other half? 50 min: Liverpool try to gain a foothold, they are in danger of being caught like Arsenal at the City Ground where Forest picked up momentum and won the tie. 48 min: An early Forest break sees Johnson try to play in Yates, it results in a free-kick where Davis is caught offside by a well-organised offside trap. Then there\u2019s another offside just as Alisson looks to have fumbled the ball with Keinan Davis lurking. Forest seem to be pushing up and pressing hard. 46 min: More Mull of Kintyre and back away we go at the City Ground, can it be as breathless as that first half where no time was added on as the ball was in play for almost the entire 45 minutes. Here\u2019s the weekend\u2019s FA quarter-final reports. The semi-final draw produced the winner of this tie versus Manchester City and then Chelsea v Crystal Palace. It\u2019s an even contest in that Forest are holding their own and Liverpool are not getting to do anything like they\u2019d want to. The chances have been scrappy, with Forest snatching at a couple on the counter and Liverpool\u2019s best opportunities coming from their opponents\u2019 lapses of concentration. 45 min: Tsimikas, clearly assigned the role of dead-ball specialist, makes another mess of one, and it\u2019s cleared easily. Joe Gomez then takes a great deal of time over a throw-in. Liverpool are not at the races at all. And that\u2019s half time. 42 min: Jurgen Klopp looks somewhat unamused and bemused. Forest have given as good as they have got and defended like demons...but Gomez gets a chance as Colback, again, slips, but whacks the ball over the bar. Gomez has never scored a goal in professional football. 40 min: A familiar face in the crowd: Forest legend/Manchester United horror story, Garry Birtles, the lad from Long Eaton who was pioneering the bearded look way before the late.2000s hipster, more Bob Grant than Shoreditch thatch. 39 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s turn to put in a weak, very clearable pass, and then foul Brennan Johnson. Not his day just yet, \u201cThe Ox\u201d, one of the least Ox-like players you could imagine. 37 min: Liverpool pressure, plenty of it, but not a great deal of quality in their final ball. 35 min: Tsimikas, to nobody\u2019s surprise, falls over when he\u2019s in a good position on the edge of the Forest box. 33 min: Keita and Oxlade-Chamberlain try to release the ever involved but not quite at it Tsimikas and the ball rolls out. Lolley speeds down the other wing and his ball to Johnson misses the target. Forest\u2019s best hopes rely on those two players down the flanks. 31 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain digs out a pass towards Firmino but Horvath is again quick and safe as he quells the danger. 29 min: Oooh, Colback almost plays Firmino in with a backpass but Horvath stands tall and bails out the midfielder, and Worrall completes the job. Soon after that, Tsimikas gets the ball and shoots from distance. His radar is well off at the moment. 27 min: Forest break to loud noise, the move started by Lolley before Johnson cuts back and they decide to hold the ball. \u201cWhere\u2019s your famous atmosphere\u201d was sung by the Liverpool fans. It\u2019s here, actually. Deafening. 25 min: All Liverpool now, and Forest doing an awful lot of chasing. Spence gets a rare chance to speed down the other end but a calm, collected Van Dijk comes across and scoops the ball from danger. 23 min: Liverpool corner, Tsimikas takes again, and again the ball is cleared. The Greece defender tries another cross and that\u2019s cleared. Virgil van Dijk has to jog back home to central defence having been nowhere near the ball. 22 min: A wildcat attack by Forest with Zinckernagel again providing the final pass. Lolley fires wide and wastefully, plenty of power, not enough direction. 21 min: Forest\u2019s defence has been sat increasingly deep, and held its shape with plenty of cover ahead of them. Liverpool dominating possession now, Forest\u2019s attacks will come on the counter. 19 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain corner, with Fabinho surging into the space but unable to connect. One from the training ground, and one that\u2019s gone to waste. On the touchline, Jurg looks a bit annoyed by that. 17 min: Gomez again cuts in, he\u2019s being given licence to do so, and shoots from distance. Horvath, the American goalie, claims it at the second time of asking but no real danger. 15 min: Tsimikas tries one from distance and it dips and swerves just over. Forest speed down the other end. Zinckernagel sets up Yates, who has time to shoot but not enough to prevent a defender coming across to deflect behind. It\u2019s a crisp, competitive cup tie. Joe Garner tries to give it a goal but whacks over the bar. 13 min: Gomez does a decent impression of \u201cTrent\u201d in speeding up on the overlap, causing panic as he does but then hitting it behind his teammates. Tsimikas then takes his second corner of the game and it\u2019s even worse than his first. \u201cTrent\u201d and \u201cRobbo\u201d both missed so far by Liverpool. 11 min: Liverpool attempt to play the ball around, try and take the sting from Forest. It eventually comes to Jota, and Worrall steps across for a superb piece of anticipation. 9 min: Hurried clearance by Van Dijk and it needed to be. More Forest pressure as Johnson speeds to the line, Lolley has the goal gaping but chooses to cross. That was a chance to hit the target, one passed up but Liverpool are struggling a little. 7 min: Jurgen Klopp is already up and issuing instructions, Liverpool yet to find their stride. Oxlade-Chamberlain plays the ball for Firmino to chase but it\u2019s overhit. It was a bit hurried, as if he felt under pressure. 5 min: Forest pushing up and in numbers. Steve Cooper hasn\u2019t set his men to defend deep. A cup tie is there to be won, after all. 4 min: A long time since these supporters were singing at each other, and the Liverpool fans are playing their part. An early dart from Johnson, the Forest youngster, and he gets to the right-hand side of the box, his cross going into Alisson\u2019s hands. Him versus Joe Gomez is a contest to watch. 2 min: Liverpool win an early corner, taken by Tsimikas and cleared as Jota lurks. The ball comes back out, and Keita chips the ball through Elliott seems set to score but the offside flag goes up. 1 min: And away we go in the FA Cup quarter-final after the players take the knee. Hell of an atmosphere at the City Ground, very loud indeed. The pre-match sound of U2\u2019s Beautiful Day ringing out as the teams come out seems apt for a tie being screened on ITV in the UK, if the wrong competition for The Premiership. It\u2019s followed by Welcome To The Jungle. Stadium DJs never play the latest hip sounds, do they? (Not that I\u2019d know what they are, but the playlist always stops around 2004, with only the Killers, Beyonce, Pharrell Williams, Amy Winehouse\u2019s Valerie and Mark Ronson escaping through. Mull of Kintyre rings out at the City Ground now, as is traditional, even if Silly Love Songs is a superior track. Ian Copestake on that 5-0 game from 1988. \u201cNot only am I one of those fans of a certain age, but I still possess the VHS tape of the drubbing that came out a few months later!\u201d Even as someone with no affinity for either club I must confess I watched that game back many times over and had the tape for a few years myself. Matt Dony: \u201cForest have got Cafu on the bench? That\u2019s a lot of experience to bring on...\u201d Can still do a job, the lad. This Cafu is a 27-year-old midfielder from Guiamares. So, there will be no Liverpool v Manchester City FA Cup final. Instead, and if Liverpool get past Forest, they can thwart each other\u2019s treble/quadruple bids in the semis. A prediction, should it happen: at least one of the managers will select a weird team as if to duck the contest. The likes of Ferguson and Wenger used to do that and it\u2019s become quite commonplace since when the rest of us want them to go hell for leather at each other at Wembley. What that will mean is it could be City v Liverpool on consecutive weekends - first in Premier League on 10 April and then the following weekend. That\u2019s the type of schedule that can heat up a rivalry that\u2019s never quite got to the Fergie/Wenger levels. Klopp and Guardiola are perhaps a little too polite. It\u2019s drawn by Robbie Fowler on ITV Manchester City will play Nottingham Forest/Liverpool Chelsea will play Crystal Palace The ties to be played at Wembley on 16/17 April. The last time they met in the FA Cup, that fateful day at Hillsborough in 1989, has been remembered in the City Ground today. And from the Forest side here, that rivalry of the late-70s. Fans of a certain age will remember this Liverpool v Forest encounter, a high point of Liverpool\u2019s last great era. The managers speak to ITV. Steve Cooper: \u201cReady as we can be, we have to believe in ourselves. We\u2019ve gone to a back four, I don\u2019t mind saying that, we\u2019ve picked some injuries up but I am believe in the next man up. [On the Hillsborough display put on at the City Ground] The 97 should never be forgotten, and rightly so.\u201d J\u00fcrgen Klopp: \u201cThey are in the quarter-final for a reason. Home games are useful for them. I think we know what to expect, hope we are ready for it. Robbo is ill, it\u2019s finally got him. Mo felt an injury again. Sadio, they have some massive games coming up. Hopefully it works out.\u201d They may not need \u201cTrent\u201d today but this is a significant absentee for Liverpool, a player replaced by Joe Gomez, who is not the same sort of player at full-back. Steve Cooper isn\u2019t quite Clough but he\u2019s the latest man entrusted with reviving Forest, and he\u2019s making a decent job of it, having beaten Arsenal and Leicester in this season\u2019s competition. Great profile by Ben Fisher to read here on someone with some history with today\u2019s opponents. For Cooper, it all started at Wrexham when his manager, Brian Flynn, encouraged the full-back to pursue coaching and he became the club\u2019s head of youth development. In the early days he juggled taking the under-18s at Wrexham with playing part-time for Rhyl, Bangor and The New Saints. By the age of 27, he had his Uefa pro licence, the highest coaching qualification available. Liverpool liked what they saw and appointed Cooper as a youth coach. One of the reasons the Clough word wasn\u2019t mentioned is that Jonathan Wilson went back there in his Observer column. The decline of Forest from European champions to top-six challengers in the 80s tends to be put down to Clough\u2019s falling out with Taylor, and that clearly was a major factor, but so, too, were basic issues of finance. Of course mistakes have been made, some of them major, and, of course, things might have been different had different decisions been taken, but Forest\u2019s post-Clough decline has essentially returned them to the status they held before he took over. Liverpool have made seven changes. Only Alisson, Virgil Van Dijk, Fabinho and Diogo Jota retain their places from the midweek win at Arsenal. Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane are omitted from the squad entirely as Harvey Elliott and Roberto Firmino join Jota up front. Nottingham Forest have made just the one change from the team that beat QPR 3-1 in midweek. Joe Lolley replaces Scott McKenna for Forest Liverpool: Alisson, Gomez, Konate, Van Dijk, Tsimikas, Fabinho, Keita, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Elliott, Jota, Firmino. Subs: Adrian, Thiago, Henderson, Jones, Minamino, Diaz, Origi, Matip, Beck. Nottingham Forest: Hovath, Spence, Figueiredo, Worrall, Colback, Davis, Zinckernagel, Johnson, Yates, Lolley, Garner. Subs: Samba, Mbe Soh, Bong, Laryea, Cafu, Ojeda, Mighten, Silva, Surridge. Who will complete the final four of the FA Cup? A tie of historic significance, a trip down memory lane will decide it. It\u2019s not since the last century, 1999, that Forest and Liverpool faced each other and by then the rivalry of the late-1970s/early-1980s and a less heated revival at the end of the 1980s was a distant memory, even if Liverpool were in the doldrums themselves by 1999. The modern Forest are in the hunt for promotion, but their cup run has seized the imagination and the agenda for now. The Liverpool of 2022 are meanwhile going for the type of quadruple that even the teams of the 1980s would have thought beyond their ken. J\u00fcrgen Klopp seems to have decided the cups are worth going for; that wasn\u2019t always the case. The City Ground awaits, a stadium where a visit does conjure memories of glories past, mostly because the place has barely changed in many years. And to draw this preamble to an end, you will notice that we have not actually mentioned his name until the very end: Brian Clough. Kick-off at 6pm UK time. Join me.",

The smoke of red flares thrown on to the pitch in celebration left the ground in a haze. \u201cWe knew before the game that City would be the opponent and we wanted to go to the final anyway,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we are the dream draw for anybody, but it will be a tough one. We have to make sure it will be tough for City as well. There are a lot of games to play before then.\u201d",

Ukrainian officials have accused Moscow of forcibly deporting thousands of people from Mariupol to Russia, as Turkey says a peace deal between the two countries is close. In Australia, Peter Malinauskas is due to be sworn in as South Australia\u2019s new premier, and paramedics are set to take industrial action in New South Wales. Forced civilian deportations from Mariupol to Russia are \u201cdisturbing\u201d and \u201cunconscionable\u201d if true, the United States has said, after Ukrainian officials accused Moscow of transporting thousands of people against their will out of the devastated port city. Though Turkey\u2019s foreign minister has claimed a peace deal between the two countries is \u201cclose\u201d, skepticism among western countries about Putin\u2019s intentions remains. Meanwhile, Germany has agreed a contract with Qatar for the supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG) that will help the European country wean itself off its dependency on Russian energy. In Australia, the government has banned the sale of alumina and aluminium ores to Russia in response to what it described as \u201cunrelenting and illegal aggression\u201d towards Ukraine. On Sunday, the prime minister Scott Morrison announced Australia would donate coal and further military equipment to Ukraine to \u201csupport the brave and courageous resistance\u201d as part of a new aid package that also includes $30m in emergency humanitarian assistance. The SA election result should have Morrison\u2019s Coalition \u201ctrembling\u201d ahead of the federal poll, Labor says, after Malinauskas became the first opposition leader to defeat an incumbent government since the start of the pandemic. The outgoing premier, Steven Marshall, announced on Sunday he would step down as Liberal leader after the landslide loss to Labor, saying he \u201ctakes full responsibility for the result\u201d and accepts \u201cthe will of the people\u201d. The prime minister sought to downplay what the resounding Labor win in SA could mean on a federal level, saying Anthony Albanese doesn\u2019t match up to his state colleagues. Australia Fifty-one asylum seekers who were brought to Australia for medical treatment continue to languish in detention in Australia, including 18 in the Park hotel in Melbourne, with no indication of when they might be released, according to a prominent refugee support group. Soaring commodity prices and a shrinking jobless rate will combine to slice almost $90bn from projected federal budget deficits out to 2024-25, although excessive pre-election promises would undermine the government\u2019s fiscal repair efforts, according to Chris Richardson, a senior economist at Deloitte. A toxic chemical released from tyres as they wear down on roads and implicated in mass deaths of salmon in the US has been found in an Australian waterway for the first time. Teachers at Brisbane religious school Citipointe Christian College are being asked to sign employment contracts that warn they could be sacked for being openly homosexual. The world The US is likely to see an increase in Covid cases like that in Europe and the UK thanks to the BA.2 virus subvariant but not a dangerous surge, Anthony Fauci said on Sunday. Worshippers at a mosque in Toronto subdued an allegedly axe-wielding man who police say attacked people with bear spray during a dawn prayer service. Police investigating the death of Sabita Thanwani, 19, at a student flat in London over the weekend have arrested a man. Ministers in the UK are looking \u201csympathetically\u201d at plans to stop the government buying health goods made in China\u2019s Xinjiang province when the health and social care bill returns to the House of Commons later this month. The move would be a first sign that the UK government is willing to toughen its approach to authoritarian regimes in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine.

It\u2019s a pat on the back for everyone.\u201d Norway\u2019s ministry of culture made the announcement on Sunday local time, timed to mark the birthday of celebrated Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen. \u201cWe are proud to be able to honour an outstanding and unique theatre company that asks questions of their audience, of society and of each other through groundbreaking productions,\u201d said chair of the prize committee, Ingrid Lorentzen. \u201cBack to Back\u2019s work is exciting, unsettling and thought-provoking. It inspires us to be better artists and better people.\u201d Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning In a letter detailing its decision, the prize panel praised Back to Back\u2019s shows as \u201csome of the most memorable productions of 21st century theatre\u201d. \u201cThere is no need for exposition in their theatre, no overreliance on dialogue, no need for a proximity of performer and role. Back to Back create a theatre that doesn\u2019t follow the rules; they take over spaces that have been marginalised, erased or rendered insignificant \u2026 this is a theatre that defies a tick box culture. It\u2019s a theatre \u2013 both pragmatic and metaphysical \u2013 that gravitates around what it means to live in the fullest sense of the word at this precise moment in history.\u201d Gladwin said they had no concrete plans for the money: \u201cWe\u2019ve just got over the shock of actually winning the award. But it is an opportunity to take some risks, to support some blue sky projects. Back to Back will receive their award, which has previously gone to British playwright Peter Brook and Nobel winner Peter Handke, at a ceremony in Oslo in September.",

Own goals now has 10 for Spurs this season, more than everyone bar the two main men. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97512a2edb06d8652a15b17d451cacd60bd4a8ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97512a2edb06d8652a15b17d451cacd60bd4a8ca/0_0_2439_1640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oh dear.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oh dear.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Klein/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-03-20T18:45:53.144Z\">at 6.45pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-623758d68f08ee17b5373366\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-03-20T16:40:13.509Z\">4.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>8 min </strong>Talking of Kane, where do we think he is now?

Why, then, has the so-called beautiful game taken over the world? </p> <p>Well, partly there\u2019s the prospect of something good, so that even if it fails to materialise, it gives us the hope that real life lacks. And partly, it\u2019s because of fixtures like this one, where the quality of play matters about as much as the context \u2013 near enough not at all \u2013 because the aspects of pride and identity, love and hate, are so intensely compelling. <br>But when we\u2019ve got quality and context as well \u2013 which we do today \u2013 we\u2019re talking about something seriously incendiary. </p> <p>Both sides, West Ham in particular, are coming off huge midweek wins, and though Arsenal are strong favourites to secure the Premier League\u2019s fourth spot in next season\u2019s Champions League, neither Antonio Conte nor David Moyes will be giving it up just yet, because both have enough to think they can go on a run. </p> <p>For Conte, it\u2019s more about the individuals \u2013 Harry Kane and Heung-min Son are brilliant, so having them gives you a chance in any game \u2013 while for Moyes it\u2019s more about the team \u2013 West Ham have both clean sheets and goals in them. And both of them must find a way to win this evening, meaning the rest of us can settle in for what promises to be an affirmingly nasty encounter.</p> <p><strong>Kick-off: 4.30pm GMT</strong></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Righto, Jacob Steinberg\u2019s match report has landed, so I\u2019ll leave you with that. Thanks for your company and comments \u2013 enjoy the rest of the weekend. Peace out. Conte is happy, having a seen a team playing football from start to finish. He thinks his team dominated the game \u2013 a little bit of an exaggeration in mine \u2013 and says the atmosphere was incredible, the fans happy to see their team win in this way. He wants to stay in the race for fourth place, a difficult task when he arrived, but his players are improving, showing commitment, and the work they\u2019re doing is paying off. He thinks City, Chelsea, Liverpool and United are the best teams in the league, but if one drops off there\u2019s a chance for Spurs and given the situation now, his players can do it. Arsenal have an advantage, but they\u2019ve got to visit Tottenham, and this is probably the most relaxed I\u2019ve seen him since he took the job. And in the women\u2019s FA Cup: Oh man, this is so great. Football! Earlier today: I reckon Spurs\u2019 performance today was getting towards where Conte wants it to be. In his system, the wing-backs are so important, and they were both really aggressive and high from the start. West Ham, though, were silly to match up formation. In so doing they made overlaps and crosses \u2013 their likeliest routes to goal \u2013 harder to achieve \u2013 and also offered space in behind to a team to struggle to break down low blocks. Son tells Sky that Spurs played really well, creating lots of chances. He\u2019s really happy with how the team played, and knew that West Ham had played 120 minutes on Thursday night, so though Spurs wanted to play quickly for that reason, they didn\u2019t focus too much on their opponents. It\u2019s always good to win before the international break, \u201cgoing away with the free mind\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s a lovely turn of phrase \u2013 and asked about his relationship with Kane, he says he\u2019s spoke about it more than 100 times now. But it\u2019s incredible to have him, and he feels bad his mate didn\u2019t score today as a teammate and as a friend. Aw! Sobering thoughts here: At the City Ground, it remains Forest 0-0 Liverpool just past the half-hour. I wonder how Moyes will play things from here. On the one hand, he\u2019s got a fair few players who\u2019ve played a lot of football, so might benefit from a rest with all energies directed at winning the Europa. However, much as they\u2019ll hope it gets them into the Champions League, if it doesn\u2019t, they\u2019ll want to be in it again, and that will require some serious effort. That\u2019s a decent afternoon\u2019s work for Spurs. It was a great time to play West Ham, but they made sure to cash in, and even at 2-1, they looked pretty comfortable. Spurs win back to back games for the first time this year and move above Man United into fourth place \u2013 three points behind Arsenal but having played a game more. West Ham slip to seventh \u2013 six behind Arsenal but having playing twice more. 90+5 min Alan Smith gives Son man of the match. I\u2019d\u2019ve gone for Kane, whose smooth passing has been the different to my mind, but not with a great deal of conviction. And as I type that, Bergwijn\u2019s trickery fashions a crossing opportunity, and he stands up a cross to the far post where Kane is basically planning his celebration, only for Emerson Royal to take it away from him with a poor header that flies wide. 90+3 min Back to West Ham, they\u2019ve still got a decent chance of qualifying for the Champions League because they\u2019re a serious threat in the Europa. Barca and Leipzig will take some beating, but believe West Ham are capable \u2013 though it\u2019d be just like them to lose to Lyon. 90+2 min Spurs send on Moura and Bergwijn for Son and Kulusevski. 90 min There\u2019ll be five added minutes. 9o min West Ham will be six points behind Arsenal having played twice more; the top four is beyond them now, but Spurs, who\u2019ve finally aborted their win-lose cycle, are bang in the chase. Realistically, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve got the class to force themselves above their local rivals, but with their strikers you never know. Stop me if you\u2019ve heard this one before! A straight ball from Lloris, a flick-on from Kane, who\u2019s attracted both markers to him, allowing Son to control beautifully, his first touch taking the ball into stride. He advances, and you know what\u2019s going to happen next because there are few better one-on-one finishers in world football; he steadies and slots under Fabianski into the bottom-left, having done the keeper with the eyes. 87 min Bentancur is down with cramp, so while he\u2019s treated, Conte sends on Royal for Reguilon. 86 min Benrahma collects Dawson\u2019s header, which drops behind him, attempts to stick it back in the mixer, and when no one can get a head on it, the ball comes back from the opposite flank and Fabianski collects well. 85 min It was Lanzini who scored the brilliant late equaliser in last season\u2019s 3-3 draw and we can be sure it\u2019ll be on the minds of the Spurs players. West Ham are struggling to sustain pressure, though ... but as I type that they win a corner down the right... 84 min Moyes sends on Vlasic for Lanzini. 83 min So far, Bentancur and Kulusevski look good acquisitions for Spurs as both are better than what was there before. But also so far, neither look good enough to materially affect the quality of the team, and it\u2019s that that makes me wonder about Conte: does he know the difference between transformative players and players out of whom he can get more than anyone else? Nowadays, the latter won\u2019t be enough to challenge for the title, never mind win it. 82 min Spurs are pressing for number three now, and when Reguilon\u2019s cross picks out Doherty, his shot is decent ... but Dawson blocks, the loose ball falling to Bentancur, who drives wide. 80 min Aaargggghhh! Hojbjerg collects the ball from Bentancur and jabs a decent ball into Kane ... and he\u2019s in! But his first touch gets a little caught under his feet, so he has to take another before shooting, by which point his body-shape is all wrong and rather than attack the finish with his laces, he has to try and force a curler with the outside of his right foot, sending the effort a couple of yards over the bar. 78 min Kane again drops deep, feeding Son to his left. But there are enough defenders able to clutter his route to goal, such that Spurs have to start again. They\u2019ll not mind that, taking heat and time out of the game with West Ham unwilling to press them; unsurprising given the match they played in midweek. 76 min Here come Spurs again, Reguilon racing down the left, but he runs out of balance as he runs out of space, sliding a shot wide of the far post. 76 min West Ham probe, but their passing is too slow to pull Spurs out of position, and Dawson sends a long ball out of play. 74 min Neither side are quite at it today, so there\u2019s been little sustained pressure from either, and increasingly Spurs look dangerous on the counter; as I type that, they break again, Kane finding Kulusevski, whose shot from distance is blocked at source. 73 min At the City Ground, Forest v Liverpool is under way. Following along with that one, here: 71 min Kane may or may not be there then, but in the meantime he\u2019s the best thing about this team by an aeon, and when Son breaks down the left, he\u2019s inside and moving onto Kulusevksi. For a moment, the gap opens for a curler into the far top corner, but it\u2019s a tiny one and the effort spins wide. 70 min Throwing it forward a moment, I can see what Conte wants Spurs to do, but I\u2019m not certain where that\u2019s going to take them. The league has moved on since he won it with Chelsea, and I can\u2019t see Spurs challenging for top four next season unless they spend serious money in the summer. 69 min Rice collects a poor clearance from Reguilon and West Ham probe down the left, but Fornals loses the ball to Romero and Spurs work it clear nicely. 68 min Spurs have upped it these last few minutes, having spent the 10 before sitting inside their own box. They absolutely do not have the defence for that, whether they get away with it on this occasion or not. 66 min Bit of welcome possession for Spurs, Son turning to feed Doherty, who stands up a cross to the far post where Reguilon is all over Johnson. Heading against him and behind, he\u2019s pure radge when the ref awards a goalkick. 64 min Fornals makes a yard, curling into the box, but Dier is up to clear. Kane then brings Spurs away, and this match is one little spark away from exploding. 62 min West Ham are looking decent now, but Spurs are a threat on the counter, and as I type that Kane comes deep again, sliding another gorgeously-weighted pass into the path of Reguilon. But Johnson catches up with him and makes a decent challenge; Reguilon wants a penalty, but the ref is having nee such thing. 61 min Fornals slides a reverse-pass in behind for Yarmolenko, who tries to screw a left-footed shot goalwards but overbalances, slicing wide of the near post instead. 60 min Spurs are sitting off now, and though West Ham are more of a counter-attacking side, this might suit them because there\u2019s a strong chance of set-pieces against a side who defend them poorly. 58 min What a couple of weeks it\u2019s been for Andriy Yarmolenko, who\u2019s country has been attacked; I\u2019ve no idea what it takes to compete in those circumstances, never mind to score two memorable winners. Anyhow, West Ham are now playing 4-2-3-1, I think, Yarmolenlo through the middle with Benrahma behind. 57 min Moyes sends on Fornals and Yarmolenko for Masuaku and Antonio. I\u2019m not surprised at the players coming in, but didn\u2019t think Antonio would be one of those hooked. 55 min Son\u2019s corner is decent, clipped to the bear post, but Masuaku heads clear and Antonio leads the counter, barging Reguilon off the ball but unable to make anything happen. But have a look! West Ham sustain the pressure, Masuakau crossing, Benrahma bringing down, then Dawson crossing for Antonio, who has time to punch home a finish but takes his eye off it and skews a poor effort wide. That\u2019s a colossal oversight. 54 min There\u2019s still a kerfuffle in the box, so Rice is told to calm his players down; the other captain, Lloris, is right up the other end so is spared a lecture from the ref. Things are warming up and rightly so. 52 min There\u2019s a scuffle in the box, Reguilon charging at Masuaku for some reason or other, but the ref defuses things then someone handcuffs themselves to the post, and there\u2019s a break while stewards resolve things. 51 min Lovely from Spurs, Bentancur fouling Benrahma deep inside his onwn half and setting off a counter, Son screeching through the middle and rolling in Kane. We\u2019ve seen this once or twice before, but Fabianski charges out of his goal to smother the attempted clip over him and cost of a corner. 50 min Trying to get a head on a ball to the back post, Doherty stoops, right as Masuaku chucks a boot at things. There\u2019s a bit of contact, but the Spurs man will be fine. 49 min Better from West Ham, who get the ball into Antonio on the left touchline. He feels Romero behind him, knocks him over and kicks through him \u2013 behaviour for which he\u2019s penalised. But these are situations they need to engineer more of. 47 min With a win here, Spurs would go a point ahead of Man United, who sit fifth in the table, but they\u2019d still be three behind Arsenal \u2013 who have a game in hand and really should close it out. 46 min The draw for last four of the FA Cup: Man City v Forest or Liverpool, Chelsea v Crystal Palace. 46 min We go again! Our teams are back with us. Goodness me. Half-time email: \u201cPlease can you forward names of the half-price Rice killers,\u201d emails Brian Withington. \u201cWe\u2019ll take two.\u201d I\u2019m not a scout, but I\u2019m not certain he\u2019s better than Kamara, Bissouma or Haidara to name three. More than that, though, much as I admire him, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever watched him and thought what he does is unusual, so paying upwards of \u00a3100m for that seems a lot. Half-time entertainment: my favourite Spurs - West Ham goal. Spurs haven\u2019t been vintage or anything like it, but West Ham are doing well to still be in this. 45+2 min Antonio drifts wide and tosses a tempting ball towards the back post, but the diving Soucek can\u2019t quite direct his diving header on target. 45+1 min Thin end of the wedge, this. 45 min There\u2019ll be two added minutes. 45 min Now Spurs win a corner, Reguilon crossing into Johnson, but it comes to nowt. 44 min ...but this time, Hojbjerg goes down, shoved by Zouma, and the ref gives Spurs a free-kick. Silly behaviour from the RSPCA man. 43 min A quiet period which will suit West Ham. Though they\u2019ve now scored, they\u2019ve not really got momentum, and I\u2019m sure Moyes is keen to get them in. But as I type that, Benrahma wins a free-kick off Reguilon, so here we go again... 41 min West Ham need to get bodies \u201cin and around\u201d Antonio. At the moment, he\u2019s too isolated \u2013 Lanzini isn\u2019t in the game. 40 min Kulusevski finds Kane who finds Reguilon and accepts his return pass, crunching a low drive wide of the near post. 39 min West Ham will be delighted to still be in this. Spurs haven\u2019t made many chances bar the goals, but they\u2019ve been by far the better side on general play. 37 min Back to Rice, I think his performance at Spurs in the League Cup is the best I\u2019ve seen from him. I know West Ham were chasing a goal with the pitch ceded to them, but although his team didn\u2019t score, he was very impressive. Cresswell swings the corner out, towards Dawson around the penalty spot, and he gets enough on the header to send the ball square to Benrahma. The finish it demands of him, a controlled volley inside the near post, is extremely tricky, but he takes it superbly and we got ourselves a ball-game! 35 min A misjudgment from Doherty hands West Ham a corner \u2013 exactly what they\u2019ll want to try and force a route back into the game... 34 min How good do we think Declan Rice is? I\u2019m a big fan, but can\u2019t help but think that you could get a better player for half of what he\u2019d cost, if you were so inclined. I guess what Rice gives you is character, personality and leadership \u2013 qualities that shouldn\u2019t be easily discounted. 32 min Son\u2019s kick misses the man at the front post, but just behind is Rice, who heads clear. 31 min This is much too easy for Spurs, so Masuakau rattles Kane to try and rouse something in his teammates. Instead, Son will now swerve a free-kick into the box... 29 min It\u2019s easy to complicate football, but this match reminds me a lot of Graeme Souness\u2019 line, \u201cthe team that gets to the ball first wins\u201d. So far, Spurs are much quicker than West Ham. 27 min Moyes may be regretting his decision to match-up Spurs\u2019 formation. Ultimately, Spurs are more used to playing it and also have better strikers, so it\u2019s not surprising they\u2019re ahead. 26 min However, this match last season... Kane is such a beautiful footballer, and he collects Bentancur\u2019s perceptive pass in stride, accelerates through the centre-circle, and calculates a sensational through-ball that sticks Son in! He takes a touch as Fabianski advances, chucks a lollipop, shoots, and the effort clips the sliding Zouma, fizzing over the keeper and into the far side-netting! Already, this feels over! 23 min Spurs counter and Son trips Dawson; the ref stops play to book him, thereby denying an advantage. 23 minWest Ham win a free-kick in centrefield and Cresswell clips it in, but Romero is up to clear. 21 mi Cresswell spreads for Masuaku, whose cross is blocked. But Spurs will be happy to defend those kinds of attacks \u2013 one overlapping the other would be much harder to handle, because West Ham could then try and work a better angle for delivery. 19 min Son wriggles across the face of the West Ham box and feeds Kulusevski, but he can\u2019t fund an angle for a serious shot or pass. Spurs, though, will want to add a second during this period, because chances are West Ham will wake up at some point. 18 min City now lead Southampton 4-1. This was a close game 15 minutes ago. 18 min Kane harries as West Ham try to play out and wins the ball back, spreading for Doherty, whose cross can\u2019t pick out Kulusevski. 16 min Bit better from West Ham keeping the ball inside the Spurs half while probing for gaps. And look at this from Benrahma, slowing up Son then sliding down the outside to unfurl a terrific cross that Antonio can\u2019t quite reach, on the leap. 14 min A poor clearance from Dawson allows Doherty to shoot, but he gets back in to head the resultant cross away from Son. West Ham still have Thursday night in their legs. 12 min Now it\u2019s Kulusevski charging forwards, and I don\u2019t see what happens because my SkyGo crashes, but when it returns, Alan Smith chastises him for not shooting. 10 min Kane plays a blind pass for Dier that Antonio reads, barrelling onto it as Dier collapses like a house of straw, and Antonio lashes a drive just wide of the far post. Victor Moses, or Matt Doherty as he\u2019s known these days, chases into a challenge with Masuaku, winning the ball and finding Kane, who nips down the right side of the box to slip a square pass for Son. But Zouma comes across, and in trying to get to it first as the shot comes in, deflects the opener past Fabianski. Own goals now has 10 for Spurs this season, more than everyone bar the two main men. 8 min Talking of Kane, where do we think he is now? At 28, is he getting worse, or would he be devastating in a better team? 7 min West Ham move it about, looking to shifts Spurs who sit back in their shape \u2013 until Kane leads an uncoordinated, unsuccessful press. 6 min It\u2019s probably just me who, when they think of Phil Foden, also thinks of this: 6 min Back at St Mary\u2019s, Fill Phoden has finished matters, putting City 3-1 up on Soton. 5 min West Ham are indeed playing five at the back and here\u2019s Johnson, with licence to attack, crossing from the right ... but Dier collects and clears. 3 min Zouma gives it away and Davies steams in, moving deep into the West Ham half. He might have a dig, but instead finds Kane who tries to turn ... but finds Rice bang up in his grille, the tackle is swift and effective. 2 min Did I really use the phrase \u201cgoing forward\u201d? Strength and comfort to my friends and family at this difficult time. 1 min Kulusevski, who\u2019s made such a good start to his Tottenham career, finds Kane, who can\u2019t find Son. But that front three will be a serious threat, today and going forward. 1 min And away we go! The players take the knee. All Black lives matter. There\u2019ll now be a minute\u2019s applause to mark the passing of Peter Barnes, who worked as secretary for both our cubs. Elsewhere, a soft penalty means Man City lead 2-1 at Southampton in the Cup. Follow along with that one here. Moyes will also know his team expended a serious amount of energy and emotion on Thursday night, so might want to ease them into the game to begin with, and aping the oppo is a decent way of helping that happen. Anyway, here come the teams! By the looks of things, West Ham have gone to three at the back to match Spurs up, Masuaku replacing Fornals. I guess that makes some sense \u2013 Moyes probably thinks he has the better team \u2013 and with Jarrod Bowen missing, he might not have the wide players to get around the sides, usually the best way of exploiting a tea playing three at the back. Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Romero, Dier, Davies, Doherty, Bentancur, Hojbjerg, Reguilon, Kulusevski, Son, Kane. Subs: Sanchez, Winks, Emerson, Rodon, Gollini, Bergwijn, Lucas Moura, White, Scarlett. West Ham: Fabianski, Johnson, Dawson, Zouma, Cresswell, Rice, Soucek, Benrahma, Lanzini, Masuaku, Antonio. Subs: Yarmolenko, Fornals, Vlasic, Areola, Noble, Diop, Fredericks, Kral, Perkins. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire) Most football matches aren\u2019t much use \u2013 for every classic, there\u2019s absolutely loads of nonsense. Why, then, has the so-called beautiful game taken over the world? Well, partly there\u2019s the prospect of something good, so that even if it fails to materialise, it gives us the hope that real life lacks. And partly, it\u2019s because of fixtures like this one, where the quality of play matters about as much as the context \u2013 near enough not at all \u2013 because the aspects of pride and identity, love and hate, are so intensely compelling. But when we\u2019ve got quality and context as well \u2013 which we do today \u2013 we\u2019re talking about something seriously incendiary. Both sides, West Ham in particular, are coming off huge midweek wins, and though Arsenal are strong favourites to secure the Premier League\u2019s fourth spot in next season\u2019s Champions League, neither Antonio Conte nor David Moyes will be giving it up just yet, because both have enough to think they can go on a run. For Conte, it\u2019s more about the individuals \u2013 Harry Kane and Heung-min Son are brilliant, so having them gives you a chance in any game \u2013 while for Moyes it\u2019s more about the team \u2013 West Ham have both clean sheets and goals in them. And both of them must find a way to win this evening, meaning the rest of us can settle in for what promises to be an affirmingly nasty encounter. Kick-off: 4.30pm GMT",

      "bodyText": "Saudi Arabia\u2019s state oil company said it would increase spending on oil production to meet rising global demand, as it reported a doubling of profits in 2021. Saudi Aramco \u2013 the world\u2019s largest oil exporter and one of the world\u2019s most profitable companies \u2013 said its net profit increased by 124% to $110bn (\u00a383bn) in 2021, compared with $49bn a year earlier. The company said its profits had soared as a result of higher crude oil prices as demand for oil rebounded after the pandemic, and also because of increased margins in its refining and chemicals business. Brent crude oil rocketed to $139 a barrel, a 14-year high, earlier this month, but has since dropped to closer to $100. In early December, a barrel of crude was priced below $70. Aramco expects demand for oil to keep climbing, and said \u201csubstantial new investment\u201d is required to meet this demand, in a move likely to dismay climate campaigners. It said it is increasing its capital expenditure for 2022 by about half to between $40 and $50bn, with further growth expected until the middle of the decade. The state-owned oil firm\u2019s capital expenditure came in just below $32bn in 2021, an 18% increase on 2020. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have been asked in recent days by western governments to pump more oil to end their reliance on supplies from Russia. The Gulf countries are the only two leading oil producers that have immediate spare capacity able to offset the shortfall in Russian-produced energy. However, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in a recent report that Saudi Arabia and the UAE are so far \u201cshowing no willingness to tap into reserves\u201d. The countries are both members of the Opec+ cartel of oil-producing countries, which will meet for the next time at the end of March to decide on output levels. Despite the conflict in Ukraine, Opec members only agreed earlier this month to raise output by a modest 400,000 barrels a day. Labour has accused the UK government of \u201cgoing cap in hand from dictator to dictator\u201d as it attempts to address the energy crisis. Aramco\u2019s president and chief executive, Amin Nasser, said the outlook for oil demand remained uncertain \u201cdue to various macro-economic and geopolitical factors\u201d. He added that the company\u2019s investment plan \u201caims to tap into rising long-term demand for reliable, affordable and ever more secure and sustainable energy. \u201cWe recognise that energy security is paramount for billions of people around the world, which is why we continue to make progress on increasing our crude oil production capacity, executing our gas expansion programme.\u201d Aramco is just the latest of the world\u2019s big oil companies to post soaring profits. In the UK, the swelling coffers at BP and Shell have prompted Labour to call on the chancellor Rishi Sunak to announce a windfall tax on oil and gas profits, an idea that he has so far resisted. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, renewed her calls on Sunday for the introduction of the tax to tackle the growing cost of the living crisis in the UK. \u201cIf we used that windfall tax on the big profits being made by North Sea oil and gas companies\u2026 to redirect it into keeping prices low, you would tackle the cost of living crisis and you would not need to have such big increases in pay,\u201d she told the BBC. Aramco briefly became the most valuable listed company in history when it floated on the Saudi stock exchange in 2019 and was named the world\u2019s most profitable business. However, it was later toppled by US tech company Apple. The state-owned company said it would pay shareholders a dividend of nearly $19bn for the final quarter of 2021, while it also plans to distribute $4bn in retained earnings to investors. This takes its total dividend for 2021 to $75bn, not including bonus shares.",

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/10/roman-abramovich-sanctioned-what-does-it-mean-for-chelsea\" title=\"\">Roman Abramovich-related crisis</a> at Chelsea FC might seem a minor subplot when tectonic plates of such magnitude are shifting. But football\u2019s global reach and modern geopolitical dimensions make it much more than that. The perfectly timed spectacle of last week\u2019s fixture <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/13/stamford-bridge-hosts-dark-day-for-those-who-care-for-footballs-soul-chelsea-newcastle-roman-abramovich\" title=\"\">between sanctioned Chelsea and Newcastle United</a> \u2013 owned by Riyadh\u2019s sovereign wealth fund \u2013 marked a moral nadir for the game, coming one day after Saudi Arabia executed 81 people. It was also shaming for this country. In football, too, a paradigm shift is needed.</p> <p>The tools to effect this \u2013 or at least start the job now \u2013 are within the government\u2019s grasp. Last April, six leading clubs attempted to join the reviled <a href=\"https://www.espn.co.uk/football/blog-espn-fc-united/story/4366927/super-league-collapses-how-fan-reactionrevolt-helped-end-english-clubs-breakaway\" title=\"\">European Super League</a> project; the horror of their own supporters demonstrated an underlying outrage among fans at the direction the sport has taken. The government set up the fan-led <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fan-led-review-of-football-governance-securing-the-games-future/fan-led-review-of-football-governance-securing-the-games-future\" title=\"\">Crouch review</a> on football governance. (As the review panel deliberated on where the game had lost its way, the Premier League waved through the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/oct/08/saudi-takeover-of-newcastle-leaves-human-rights-to-fog-on-the-tyne\" title=\"\">takeover of Newcastle</a> by the fund, chaired by the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.)</p> <p>Published in November, the review calls for the establishment of an independent regulator of the game. The independent regulator for English football (IREF) would be able to examine new potential owners according to various criteria, including an \u201cintegrity test\u201d; the judgment would be one of whether prospective buyers would be \u201csuitable custodians of vital community assets\u201d. Tracey Crouch, the Conservative MP who is chair of the review panel, <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/tyne-tees/2021-11-25/tracey-crouch-independent-regulator-would-have-tested-newcastle-takeover-more\" title=\"\">believes</a> that had an integrity test been in place at the time of the Newcastle takeover, better \u201cstress-testing\u201d would have taken place.</p> <p>The Premier League has resisted the proposal (one club director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/01/leeds-chief-executive-likens-call-for-transfer-levy-and-regulator-to-maoism\" title=\"\">denounced it as \u201cMaoism\u201d</a>). But oligarchs, authoritarian states and \u2013 in the case of the Glazer family at Manchester United \u2013 asset-strippers, have run rings round the league\u2019s own \u201cfit and proper\u201d test for ownership. This was originally designed to weed out small-time fraudsters and charlatans at lower league level, but has merely operated as a fig leaf of respectability while the game changed beyond recognition. The extraordinary influx of wealth has been amorally treated as a boon for everyone lucky enough to be associated with the richest league in the world.</p> <p>The unprecedented turmoil of the last fortnight should strengthen the government\u2019s resolve to follow up on Ms Crouch\u2019s recommendations. They should be in the next Queen\u2019s speech, and a specific human rights dimension should be incorporated into the IREF\u2019s role. Legislation to introduce a regulator would help to ensure the kind of protection appropriate to cherished national institutions. Politicians often talk about footballers\u2019 responsibility to be role models; what about the clubs themselves? Other Crouch measures \u2013 such as a fans\u2019 golden share giving a veto over matters vital to the identity of a club, including the stadium\u2019s location and team colours \u2013 would begin to restore a democratic balance between the aristocrats who run clubs and the serfs who fill them.</p> <p>The fate of Chelsea is now subject to a bidding war. But all the focus has been on the wealth of the various corporate entities and hedge funds involved rather than what is best for the fans and the wider game. All but a few hundred Chelsea supporters were excluded on Saturday from attending a classic English football occasion \u2013 the FA Cup quarter-final at Middlesbrough \u2013 because their sanctioned club is for the time being unable to sell tickets. The ultimate outcome of the deeply unedifying episode that began when Mr Abramovich bought the club in 2003 must be a moral recalibration in the governance of the game.</p>",

      "bodyText": "From the future of the global economy to energy security and defence spending, the shock of Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine is provoking a dizzying rethink of policy priorities and assumptions. The Roman Abramovich-related crisis at Chelsea FC might seem a minor subplot when tectonic plates of such magnitude are shifting. But football\u2019s global reach and modern geopolitical dimensions make it much more than that. The perfectly timed spectacle of last week\u2019s fixture between sanctioned Chelsea and Newcastle United \u2013 owned by Riyadh\u2019s sovereign wealth fund \u2013 marked a moral nadir for the game, coming one day after Saudi Arabia executed 81 people. It was also shaming for this country. In football, too, a paradigm shift is needed. The tools to effect this \u2013 or at least start the job now \u2013 are within the government\u2019s grasp. Last April, six leading clubs attempted to join the reviled European Super League project; the horror of their own supporters demonstrated an underlying outrage among fans at the direction the sport has taken. The government set up the fan-led Crouch review on football governance. (As the review panel deliberated on where the game had lost its way, the Premier League waved through the takeover of Newcastle by the fund, chaired by the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.) Published in November, the review calls for the establishment of an independent regulator of the game. The independent regulator for English football (IREF) would be able to examine new potential owners according to various criteria, including an \u201cintegrity test\u201d; the judgment would be one of whether prospective buyers would be \u201csuitable custodians of vital community assets\u201d. Tracey Crouch, the Conservative MP who is chair of the review panel, believes that had an integrity test been in place at the time of the Newcastle takeover, better \u201cstress-testing\u201d would have taken place. The Premier League has resisted the proposal (one club director denounced it as \u201cMaoism\u201d). But oligarchs, authoritarian states and \u2013 in the case of the Glazer family at Manchester United \u2013 asset-strippers, have run rings round the league\u2019s own \u201cfit and proper\u201d test for ownership. This was originally designed to weed out small-time fraudsters and charlatans at lower league level, but has merely operated as a fig leaf of respectability while the game changed beyond recognition. The extraordinary influx of wealth has been amorally treated as a boon for everyone lucky enough to be associated with the richest league in the world. The unprecedented turmoil of the last fortnight should strengthen the government\u2019s resolve to follow up on Ms Crouch\u2019s recommendations. They should be in the next Queen\u2019s speech, and a specific human rights dimension should be incorporated into the IREF\u2019s role. Legislation to introduce a regulator would help to ensure the kind of protection appropriate to cherished national institutions. Politicians often talk about footballers\u2019 responsibility to be role models; what about the clubs themselves? Other Crouch measures \u2013 such as a fans\u2019 golden share giving a veto over matters vital to the identity of a club, including the stadium\u2019s location and team colours \u2013 would begin to restore a democratic balance between the aristocrats who run clubs and the serfs who fill them. The fate of Chelsea is now subject to a bidding war. But all the focus has been on the wealth of the various corporate entities and hedge funds involved rather than what is best for the fans and the wider game. All but a few hundred Chelsea supporters were excluded on Saturday from attending a classic English football occasion \u2013 the FA Cup quarter-final at Middlesbrough \u2013 because their sanctioned club is for the time being unable to sell tickets. The ultimate outcome of the deeply unedifying episode that began when Mr Abramovich bought the club in 2003 must be a moral recalibration in the governance of the game.",

Warning Israelis that they would have to live with their choices, Zelenskiy, who is Jewish, said Russia\u2019s president was waging an \u201call-out war, illegitimate, intended to destroy our people, our country, our cities, our culture and our children. Everything that makes Ukrainians Ukrainian\u201d. \u201cThe Russians use the terminology of the Nazi party, want to destroy everything,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Nazis called this \u2018the final solution\u2019 to the Jewish question. And now \u2026 in Moscow \u2026 they\u2019re using those words, \u2018the final solution\u2019. But now it\u2019s directed against us and the Ukrainian question.\u201d Israel has condemned the invasion of Ukraine, but has not followed the west in imposing sanctions on Moscow. Under Israeli law, it can only do so to a state formally designated as an enemy. Israel also has an understanding with the Kremlin that allows Israeli forces to strike at Iranian arms shipments to Hezbollah in Lebanon or other Iranian-backed militia in Syria, where Russia has held up Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime. Israel\u2019s prime minister Naftali Bennett has instead sought to position his government as a mediator in the ongoing but so far fruitless peace negotiations. Zelenskiy went on: \u201cEverybody knows that your missile defence systems are the best and that you can definitely help our people, save the lives of Ukrainians, of Ukrainian Jews. \u201cWe can ask why we can\u2019t receive weapons from you, why Israel has not imposed powerful sanctions on Russia or is not putting pressure on Russian business. Either way, the choice is yours to make, brothers and sisters, and you must then live with your answer, the people of Israel. \u201cWe are turning to you and asking whether it is better to provide help or mediation without choosing a side. I will let you decide the answer to the question, but I do want to point out that indifference kills.\u201d While there are significant doubts in the west about the peace talks, Turkey\u2019s foreign minister, Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu, claimed that agreement on the terms of a deal was \u201cclose\u201d. The Turkish government has also sought to act as a \u201cmediator and facilitator\u201d. \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu said there was \u201cmomentum\u201d behind the negotiations. Kyiv was said to be open to changing its constitution to abandon aspirations to join Nato, but wants Turkey, Germany and the five permanent members of the UN security council to act as guarantors of any deal. \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu, who visited Russia and Ukraine this week to meet his counterparts, said: \u201cOf course, it is not an easy thing to come to terms with while the war is going on, while civilians are killed, but we would like to say that momentum is still gained \u2026 We see that the parties are close to an agreement.\u201d The UN\u2019s human rights office said on Sunday that at least 902 civilians had been killed and 1,459 injured as of midnight on 19 March, with the real toll likely to be much higher. Most of the casualties were from explosive weapons such as heavy artillery shells and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes, the OHCHR said. It has not been able to receive or verify casualty reports from several badly hit cities including Mariupol. Ukraine\u2019s government claims that 112 children are among the dead. UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, said 10 million people \u2013 about a quarter of Ukraine\u2019s population \u2013 had now fled their homes, with nearly 3.4 million of the total having gone to neighbouring countries, mostly via the Polish border. Speaking on Sunday, the British chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said it was \u201cencouraging\u201d that the talks were continuing but that the west needed to keep a \u201cdegree of scepticism\u201d. However, in an interview with CNN, Zelenskiy said that despite the doubts, he would continue to try to find a compromise with the Kremlin. He said: \u201cI\u2019m ready for negotiations. I was ready for the last two years. And without negotiations we cannot end this war. \u201cAll the people who think that this dialogue is shallow, and that it is not going to resolve anything, they just don\u2019t understand that this is very valuable. If there is just 1% chance for us to stop this war, we need to take this chance, we need to do that. \u201cBut if these attempts fail, that would mean that this is a third world war.\u201d An official in Zelenskiy\u2019s office told the Associated Press that the main subject discussed between the two sides last week was whether Russian troops would remain in the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine\u2019s deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, told Sky News that redrawing Ukraine\u2018s borders is \u201cabsolutely not\u201d being considered by Kyiv, a sign of the major obstacles remaining in the way of a deal. She said: \u201cUkrainian territory is a territory which has been fixed [since] 1991. That is not an option for discussion.\u201d In an interview with the H\u00fcrriyet newspaper, \u0130brahim Kalin, a spokesman for Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, said six points were the focus of the talks. They are Ukraine\u2018s neutrality, disarmament and security guarantees, the so-called \u201cde-Nazification\u201d of the country, removal of obstacles on the use of the Russian language in Ukraine, the status of the breakaway Donbas region, and Crimea, which was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014.",

Jackson\u2019s confirmation will not affect the balance of a court which conservatives dominate 6-3, as she will replace another liberal, the retiring Stephen Breyer.</p> <p>Hawley is, however, one of several hard-right members of the judiciary committee, alongside Ted Cruz of Texas and Tom Cotton of Arkansas, to harbour presidential ambitions. Such senators could see attacking a Biden nominee as a way to appeal to supporters.</p> <p>This week, in tweets echoed by the Republican National Committee, Hawley highlighted a potential line of attack.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve noticed an alarming pattern when it comes to Judge Jackson\u2019s treatment of sex offenders, especially those preying on children,\u201d Hawley said.</p> <p>He did not raise the issue when he questioned Jackson last year, before voting against her confirmation to an appeals court. The White House said the senator was pushing \u201ctoxic and weakly presented misinformation\u201d.</p> <p>Jackson sat on the US Sentencing Commission, an agency meant to reduce disparity in federal prison sentences. The sentencing expert Douglas Berman, an Ohio State law professor, has said her record shows she is skeptical of the range of sentences recommended for child abuse images cases, the subject seized upon by Hawley.</p> <p>\u201cBut so too were prosecutors in the majority of her cases and so too are district judges nationwide,\u201d Berman wrote.</p> <p>Durbin told ABC\u2019s This Week: \u201cAs far as Senator Hawley is concerned, here\u2019s the bottom line \u2013 he\u2019s wrong. He\u2019s inaccurate and unfair in his analysis.</p> <p>\u201cJudge Jackson has been scrutinised more than any person I can think of. This is her fourth time before the Senate judiciary committee. In three previous times, she came through with flying colors and bipartisan support, the last time just last year.</p> <p>\u201cAnd now Senator Hawley is making these charges that came out of nowhere. The independent factcheckers \u2026 have discredited his claims already. They should have.

      "bodyText": "The Missouri Republican Josh Hawley is wrong to attack Ketanji Brown Jackson, Joe Biden\u2019s supreme court nominee, and should be ignored in confirmation hearings this week, the Senate judiciary chair said. Hawley, the Illinois Democrat Dick Durbin said, is \u201cpart of the fringe within the Republican party \u2026 a man who was fist-bumping the murderous mob that descended on the Capitol on 6 January of the last year. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the credibility he thinks he does.\u201d If confirmed, Jackson will be the first Black woman on the court. If Democrats hold their 50 votes she will be installed, via Kamala Harris\u2019s vote as vice-president. Jackson has attracted Republican support before and some have indicated they may back her this time. Jackson\u2019s confirmation will not affect the balance of a court which conservatives dominate 6-3, as she will replace another liberal, the retiring Stephen Breyer. Hawley is, however, one of several hard-right members of the judiciary committee, alongside Ted Cruz of Texas and Tom Cotton of Arkansas, to harbour presidential ambitions. Such senators could see attacking a Biden nominee as a way to appeal to supporters. This week, in tweets echoed by the Republican National Committee, Hawley highlighted a potential line of attack. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed an alarming pattern when it comes to Judge Jackson\u2019s treatment of sex offenders, especially those preying on children,\u201d Hawley said. He did not raise the issue when he questioned Jackson last year, before voting against her confirmation to an appeals court. The White House said the senator was pushing \u201ctoxic and weakly presented misinformation\u201d. Jackson sat on the US Sentencing Commission, an agency meant to reduce disparity in federal prison sentences. The sentencing expert Douglas Berman, an Ohio State law professor, has said her record shows she is skeptical of the range of sentences recommended for child abuse images cases, the subject seized upon by Hawley. \u201cBut so too were prosecutors in the majority of her cases and so too are district judges nationwide,\u201d Berman wrote. Durbin told ABC\u2019s This Week: \u201cAs far as Senator Hawley is concerned, here\u2019s the bottom line \u2013 he\u2019s wrong. He\u2019s inaccurate and unfair in his analysis. \u201cJudge Jackson has been scrutinised more than any person I can think of. This is her fourth time before the Senate judiciary committee. In three previous times, she came through with flying colors and bipartisan support, the last time just last year. \u201cAnd now Senator Hawley is making these charges that came out of nowhere. The independent factcheckers \u2026 have discredited his claims already. They should have. There\u2019s no truth to what he says. \u201cAnd he\u2019s part of the fringe within the Republican party. This was a man who was fist-bumping the murderous mob that descended on the Capitol on 6 January of last year. He doesn\u2019t have the credibility he thinks he does.\u201d This week, Politico demanded Hawley stop using for fundraising purposes a picture of his famous raised-fist salute to protesters before the deadly attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters. Hawley indicated that he would not stop using the image.

Using a key Republican attack line in an election year, Barrasso added: \u201cGoing through the record, there are some concerns that people have about her being perceived as soft on crime.

      "bodyText": "Forced civilian deportations from Mariupol to Russia are \u201cdisturbing\u201d and \u201cunconscionable\u201d if true, the US has said, after Ukrainian officials accused Moscow of transporting thousands of people against their will out of the devastated port city. On Sunday evening, the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti said a humanitarian corridor would open out of the heavily shelled city from 10am Moscow time (7am GMT) on Monday. Moscow also demanded defenders of Mariupol surrender and laid down their arms by 5am. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, America\u2019s ambassador to the UN, said the US had not yet confirmed the allegations, made on Saturday by Mariupol city council and repeated in detail on Sunday by Ukraine\u2019s human rights spokesperson, Lyudmyla Denisova. \u201cI\u2019ve only heard it. I can\u2019t confirm it,\u201d Thomas-Greenfield told CNN. \u201cBut I can say it is disturbing. It is unconscionable for Russia to force Ukrainian citizens into Russia and put them in what will basically be concentration and prisoner camps.\u201d As the UN said 10 million people \u2013 about a quarter of Ukraine\u2019s prewar population \u2013had been displaced by the conflict and Ukrainian authorities accused Moscow of bombing an art school in Mariupol where more than 400 people had taken shelter, Denisova said Russian troops had \u201ckidnapped\u201d residents and taken them to Russia. \u201cSeveral thousand Mariupol residents have been deported to Russia,\u201d she said on Telegram. After processing at \u201cfiltration camps\u201d, some had been transported to the Russian city of Taganrog, about 60 miles (100km) from Mariupol, and from there sent by rail \u201cto various economically depressed cities in Russia\u201d, she said. Denisova said Ukrainian citizens had been \u201cissued papers that require them to be in a certain city. They have no right to leave it for at least two years with the obligation to work at the specified place of work. The fate of others remains unknown.\u201d Russian news agencies have reported that hundreds of people whom Moscow are calling refugees have been taken by bus from Mariupol to Russia. Denisova said the \u201cabductions and forced displacements\u201d violated the Geneva and European human rights conventions and called on the international community to \u201crespond \u2026 and increase sanctions against the terrorist state of the Russian Federation\u201d. Resident Anna Iwashyna, 39, who recently fled Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, said: \u201cI don\u2019t know if people are being taken to Russia by force, but I can say for sure nobody is going there willingly.\u201d Iwashyna said conditions in the city were atrocious. \u201cThe entire infrastructure has been destroyed,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cThere are no shops, no pharmacies, no medical aid, fires are all around the city, there are no firefighters. There\u2019s nowhere to get food.\u201d Iwashyna said she had seen \u201cdead bodies on the street, with my own eyes. Right by the Maritime University. There was a missile, it was still stuck into an intersection, and there was a dead person on the sidewalk. I could hear planes all night long, they are bombing and bombing and bombing the city, non-stop.\u201d Another resident, Roman Kruglyakov, left his hometown of Mariupol to stay in a nearby village at the beginning of the war. From March 17 to March 19, he made three trips back to the devastated city to pick up his trapped family members. \u201cOut of the 25 people who I took out, there was not one who wanted to evacuate to Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all want to go to Zaporizhzhia but not everyone is able to.\u201d Days after Russian shells struck a theatre in the city that was also being used as a shelter, local authorities said Mariupol\u2019s G12 art school had been destroyed while women, children and elderly people were inside. There was no immediate word on casualties at the site and no further update on the search for survivors at the theatre.

Bombarded since the start of the invasion, many of Mariupol\u2019s residents have been without heat, power or water for more than a fortnight. Local authorities have said at least 2,300 have died, some of whom had to be buried in mass graves. Denisova also accused Russian forces of the murder of 56 elderly people in the town of Kreminna in the Luhansk region after a Russian tank \u201ccynically and purposefully fired at a home for the elderly\u201d. Fifteen survivors were \u201cabducted by the occupiers\u201d, she said, calling the attack \u201canother act of horrific genocide\u201d.

Two have just been given the go-ahead, at Brunsb\u00fcttel and Wilhelmshaven, but may take three years to build. Germany imported about 56bn cubic metres of natural gas from Russia in 2020. Nearly 55% of its gas imports came from Russia, with 40% of the demand for gas in Germany coming from industry. The EU\u2019s total gas imports from Russia are about 168bn cubic metres. In 2020, Qatar exported 106bn cubic metres, selling the bulk of the product to Asian markets. In Doha, Habeck stressed the future for Europe was to develop a diversity of suppliers, and there would be little point in Germany transferring its dependency from one supplier to another. Germany is also in talks with Norway, Canada and the US. He admitted previous German administrations had made a mistake by becoming so dependent on Russia. Moscow also provides 34% of German oil, predominantly along the Druzhba pipeline. As a result Germany has insisted the EU does not sanction two banks that service German purchases of Russian energy. The former head of the Ukrainian state energy company Naftogaz, Andriy Kobolyev, believes Germany could take a tougher line by continuing to take Russian energy but refusing to pay for the gas until Russia pulled out of Ukraine. He said Russia cannot simply turn off the gas supplies, and there would be enough to get Germany through the next winter. Habeck has ruled out reversing the planned switch-off of nuclear power in Germany, scheduled for the end of 2022. But he is said to be open to extending the life of coal powered stations, all due to close by 2030. Disputes inside Germany rage over whether it would be possible to cut off Russian energy. Bruegel, a Brussels-based thinktank, has suggested the EU could survive next winter if all Russian pipeline imports were halted, though it would require painful measures including power rationing. The EU itself has said it aims to reduce the bloc\u2019s gas imports from Russia by nearly two-thirds by the end of 2022, and to make Europe independent from all Russian fossil fuels well before 2030. The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, hinted France was willing to go further, saying: \u201cShould we immediately stop buying Russian oil, should, a little bit further down the line, we stop importing Russian gas? The president has never ruled out these options.\u201d",

Foreign-facing English-language media appears to be more inclined to report on Russian atrocities and refer to it as a \u201cwar\u201d, signalling an awareness that its position on Russia is not being well received, but this too is contradicted by the disinformation and rhetoric coming from foreign officials. \u201cEnglish-language publications \u2013 such as CGTN \u2013 are directed at foreigners, and operate according to an entirely different propaganda script,\u201d says Prof Carl Minzner, a China scholar and professor of law at Fordham law school. \u201cBut since those aren\u2019t directed at Chinese citizens, they aren\u2019t a good measure for evaluating how Beijing seeks to depict the conflict for its home audience.\u201d In non-official media and social media, pro-Russian rhetoric is much more common. The pro-Russian discourse among Chinese internet users aligns with \u2013 or perhaps was born of \u2013 the strong anti-US sentiment which has fostered in recent years, says Liu. \u201cIt is dangerously negative,\u201d says Liu, and impossible to quantify. \u201cThats why Hu\u2019s voice is important,\u201d says Liu. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the percentage of who he\u2019s representing but it\u2019s an important dissenting voice.\u201d There is huge interest in the conflict and news stories are trending with hundreds of millions of views and tens of thousands of comments. Dissenting voices are there, mostly concerned about the impact on civilians. But they are few and far between, and subject to censorship. On Friday Wang Jixian, a Chinese national in Odesa, posted two new video diaries to YouTube \u2013 a site banned in China \u2013 in which he railed against Putin, calling him a \u201ccoward\u201d and \u201cvillain\u201d, as well as against Putin\u2019s supporters, and the Chinese authorities for shutting down debate. Wang, whose videos have amassed hundreds of thousands of views, said much of his content had been \u201ccancelled\u201d and he had been blocked from sending messages on WeChat and from contacting his parents, who are still in China. He asked people to tell them he was still alive. \u201cWhy are you pressuring my parents? Your power is bestowed to you by your people, with your guns and bombs, are these for you to fire at your own people? Do you like oppression that much? Come on, fire at your own citizen!\u201d he said. \u201cMaking up lies is the only technique and language you have, right? I know I am gonna see more rumours about me, but do you think I really care?\u201d Wang\u2019s videos have drawn vitriol on the Chinese internet, including accusations of being a friend of separatists, a China-slanderer, a US-worshipper, and an embarrassment to Beijingers. \u201cTaking advantage of both sides, refined egoism, bah, disgusting,\u201d said one. Liu hopes Hu, who is still in China, is not punished for his essay. \u201cFor scholars to express their own opinions, and [to] allow people to debate, is very important trait of any great power,\u201d he says. \u201cChina says it\u2019s a great power and any great power should have the self-confidence to allow healthy, vibrant discussion.\u201d",

Hamilton is not only eyeing sweet vengeance but also a record eighth championship \u2013 yet his car, if the early signs are anything to go by, could seriously hamper his chances.</p> <p><strong>Hamilton was in the unfamiliar position yesterday</strong> of playing catch-up to his competitors, coming fifth in qualifying in Bahrain \u2013 and his teammate George Russell ninth \u2013 after his Mercedes struggled with \u201cporpoising\u201d, a bouncing induced by a break in downforce on straights, which left him six tenths off pole. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a nightmare to drive,\u201d he griped afterwards, dispelling any suspicions of Mercedes sandbagging in practice.</p> <p><strong>Less aerodynamically beleaguered</strong> was reigning champ Max Verstappen, who zipped round the course with characteristic brio in Red Bull\u2019s sleek car \u2013 yet still came out in second behind the fearsome Charles Leclerc, whose Ferrari teammate Carlos Sainz also roared into third. The blink of an eye \u2013 or 0.129secs \u2013 separated the top three. With Ferrari having spent much of last year working on their 2022 car targeting at the new regulations, the team\u2019s long game might be about to pay off. Could it mean a three-way title tussle? And if not, will Mercedes even be in the picture?</p> <p><strong>Those are the wider questions</strong>, some clues to which will hopefully be found in the more immediate excitement of today\u2019s curtain-raiser, which inaugurates <a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.7-key-rule-changes-for-the-2022-season.2E7JH9MywymU8xxw6r5yDS.html\">a raft of new rules</a> \u2013 introduced with the aim of enabling the cars to race closer together for longer. But after yesterday\u2019s showings the smart money will surely be on Leclerc, who likes this circuit: he took pole here and was conformably leading in 2019 only to fall away because of an engine problem.</p> <p><strong>And for a bit of cheer,</strong> turn your thoughts to the man starting in seventh. Kevin Magnussen was, a mere month ago, making peace with the idea that his F1 career was over. He had been dropped by Haas in 2020 and had even begun a career in endurance racing, but was recalled after Nikita Mazepin was sacked by the team this month. \u201cIt\u2019s so strange all of this,\u201d grinned Magnussen yesterday. \u201cI had a whole year to 15 months of trying to get used to the fact F1 wasn\u2019t going to be part of my life any more. I kind of got to a good place with that.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Well, welcome back Kevin</strong>, and welcome back F1. Stay tuned!</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s our report from a dramatic season-opener. That\u2019s all from me \u2013 thanks for reading! And here\u2019s Charles Leclerc: \u201cI\u2019m so happy. We knew this was a big opportunity for the team and the guys have done an incredible job building into amazing car. A one-two today with Carlos \u2013 we couldn\u2019t hope for better. It\u2019s incredible to be back at the top.\u201d Lewis Hamilton speaks: \u201cA big big congratulations to Ferrari, it\u2019s so good to see them doing well again. It was such a difficult race \u2013 we\u2019ve struggled throughout practice and this was the best result we could. We\u2019re grateful for these points, the guys are working really hard back at the factory, there\u2019s a long way to go.\u201d Mercedes, who came into this race pretty much hoping to avoid humiliation, end the night with 27 points to Red Bull\u2019s zero \u2013 and just by keeping their cars on the road! But what a day for Ferrari, who have roundly lived up to the pre-season hype. Or in the words of their winning driver: \u201cOne, two baby. Whoo! Mama mia!\u201d So Leclerc wraps up the win that looked likely all race, but what late drama behind him! Both Red Bull\u2019s cars gave up in the final moments to leave it open for a Ferrari one-two, and for Lewis Hamilton to help himself to third! Russell fourth, Magnussen fifth, Bottas sixth. To be a fly on the wall in the Red Bull garage after this race\u2026 Lap 57/57: \u2026 but he spins going into turn one on the final lap! A mechanical failure by the looks of it. And he\u2019s out too! Oh, Red Bull! Hamilton now likely to get a podium, Leclerc nailed on to win. Lap 56/57: And is Perez\u2019s car now losing power?! He seems to be in trouble and Hamilton look to pounce but Perez holds him off for now\u2026 Lap 56/57: It\u2019s a nightmare for Verstappen, who is overtaken by Perez, Hamilton, Russell \u2026 and in the end heads into the pits. His car looks to have lost power. What a miserable finish for him. Can Hamilton get on the podium? Lap 55/57: Verstappen\u2019s biggest concern now is whether he\u2019ll keep hold of second. Sainz eats up the ground behind him, puts his foot down and overtakes him for a Ferrari one-two! Lap 54/57: With DRS enabled, Hamilton is closing in on Sainz in fourth, less than a second between them. Leclerc\u2019s lead is now a tidy 3secs. Lap 52/57: Verstappen looks to be coping with his steering problem, clinging on the P2 and fending off a concerted attack from Sainz to do so. Alonso also gets past Schumacher and eyes Tsunoda in 10th. Magnussen stays in seventh, with Hamilton and Russell likewise retaining fifth and sixth. Lap 51/57: Green flag. No DRS for two laps now. Leclerc zips away and Sainz hunts down Verstappen into turn one. He\u2019s held off, but Tusonda gets past Schumacher while Leclerc clocks up the fastest lap, extending his lead to 1.4secs. Lap 51/57: The safety car is coming in. \u201cIt\u2019s more and more difficult to steer with speed,\u201d Verstappen tells his team. The response: \u201cThe situation is stable, it\u2019s not getting worse. If it becomes undriveable, you know the situation.\u201d Lap 49/57: \u201cThe safety car must go quicker,\u201d says Leclerc \u201cIt gives me a big disadvantage by going slow like this.\u201d We\u2019re about to get racing again \u2013 and lapped cars can now un-lap themselves, after the Abu Dhabi fiasco. Top 10: 1) Charles Leclerc, Ferrari 2) Max Verstappen, Red Bull 3) Carlos Sainz, Ferrari 4) Sergio Perez, Red Bull 5) Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes 6) George Russell, Mercedes 7) Kevin Magnussen, Haas 8) Valtteri Bottas, Alfa Romeo 9) Esteban Ocon, Alpine 10) Mick Schumacher, Haas Lap 48/57: The Red Bull team give Verstappen a message: \u201cMax, steering update, we are staying out, we don\u2019t believe it is a reliability concern.\u201d Lap 47/57: Red Bull\u2019s team half-expect Verstappen to head back into the pits with his steering problem, but he goes round again. Leclerc has swapped to the soft compound tyre, while Russell also pitted under the safety car \u2013 which is still out. Lap 46/57: Leclerc uses the opportunity to pit under safety car conditions. He\u2019ll retain the lead as he comes back out, albeit not at the 5secs it was. Lap 46/57: We have a virtual safety car because Gasly\u2019s car has overheated. Lap 45/57: Ferrari call Sainz into the pits but leave Leclerc out. Meanwhile Verstappen looks like he\u2019s having mechanical difficulties \u2013 something\u2019s up with his steering wheel \u2013 while Hamilton heads into the pits too, and zips out into sixth. Lap 44/57: Verstappen makes a late pit stop! And so does his teammate Perez. A late gambit from Red Bull. Meanwhile Kevin Magnussen, who a month ago was readying himself for a career change, is enjoying himself in seventh. Lap 41/57: Norris, the only man going for a one-stop, is stuck back in P15, while the late-arriving Hulkenberg is right at the back. Leclerc now leads by 4secs and looks in total control. Lap 39/57: Alonso waves Ocon past, the Frenchman wanting to use his fresh tyres to hound down Gasly in eighth. Albon comes close to hitting Sainz on his way out of the pits. \u201cThat guy nearly crashed into me!\u201d yelps Sainz. Lap 36/57: Gasly passes Magnussen for ninth before the Dane returns the favour, and with the wind in his sails scoots past Zhou and into seventh. Lap 35/57: \u201cYou are free to push now, Max, free to push,\u201d Verstappen is told by the team he has just berated. Hamilton is warned for exceeding track limits. The top 10: Leclerc Verstappen +1.8 Sainz +16.9 Perez +19.3 Hamilton +29.4 Magnussen +44.4 Russell +54.1 Bottas +57.6 Zhou +60.6 Gasly +61.3 Lap 34/57: Verstappen gets grouchy on the radio: \u201cThis is now two times I have taken it easy on the out lap and I could have easily been in front. I\u2019m never, ever doing it again!\u201d But he is at least back into second after Sainz and Perez both hit the pits. Leclerc leads once again, by just shy of 2secs. Lap 33/57: He does, and emerges in front of the Red Bull car \u2013 but only just. Hamilton sweeps past Magnussen to enter the top six. Lap 32/57: Verstappen pits from second to change to mediums, and Leclerc looks all set to do the very same. Lap 30/57: They\u2019re fanning out at the front: Leclerc 4.1secs ahead of Verstappen, who is 6.7secs ahead of Sainz. Lap 29/57: \u201cThey\u2019re almost dead again, the tyres,\u201d says Max Verstappen on the radio. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised after how he pushed them!\u201d comes the reply. Lap 28/57: Hamilton comes in for another stop, swapping hard tyres for mediums, and emerges behind Gasly in eighth. He\u2019s told on the radio that those are his types for the remainder of the race. Lap 26/57: Back in P12, Bottas goes for Tsunoda, who holds him off smartly. We should think about three stops,\u201d says Sainz on the radio. Norris, in contrast, looks like he\u2019s going for a one-stopper. Lap 24/57: Norris is the only driver yet to pit. Verstappen has been told to cool his brakes, and has fallen away from Leclerc a bit with the gap now at 3secs. Hamilton is 24secs off the lead in fifth, Russell in sixth. The leaderboard: Leclerc Verstappen +1.9 Sainz +9.8 Perez +12.8 Hamilton +20.8 Russell +27.1 Magnussen +32.5 Gasly +38.5 Alonso +42.5 Ocon +46.5 @Mysteron_voice: \u201cAh yes, the classic Ferrari *burgundy* ... these new super shiny cars might take a couple of races to get used to\u2026\u201d And similar sentiments from Thomas Stratford: \u201cJust me or is this year\u2019s car more of a plumy purple than the traditional red of Ferrari? Maybe it\u2019s the tint under the lights, reminds me slightly of that year Arsenal changed their home kit for the final season at Highbury.\u201d Edwin Imoesi is excited, and rightly so. \u201cI think this is just going to be an amazing season,\u201d he writes. \u201cAnd if Mercedes can fix their car, it\u2019s going to be a three way title fight.\u201d Lap 19/57: And there\u2019s the hattrick! Well, sort of: this time Verstappen locks up after his customary overtake at turn one, so Leclerc doesn\u2019t have to wait long to reclaim the lead. But this is a helluva battle. Leclerc leads by a second, Verstappen might have flat spotted his tyre. Lap 18/57: And we get the same again! Verstappen sweeps past Leclerc going into turn one before the Mon\u00e9gasque puts his foot down to reel the in Red Bull, cutting across him at turn four. Lap 17/57: Verstappen, his car sparking like mad, picks off Leclerc at turn one! but Leclerc reacts straight away, coming right back to reclaim top spot with DRS in the run-up to turn four. Lap 16/57: Leclerc pits and comes back to a rattling duel with Verstappen, who is now in P2 and just four tenths off the leader. Hamilton\u2019s tyres have warmed up and he has picked off Zhou for P7. Lap 15/57: Verstappen heads into the pits and speeds straight out after an exemplary stop. Sainz and Ocon follow him in. Russell has snuck up to P3, just behind Perez, while Leclerc is 13secs out in front. Lap 14/57: Hamilton reclaims P11 from Zhou and trains his sights on Bottas. Alonso and Schumacher both swap to mediums. Lap 12/57: McLaren aren\u2019t having a great day so far, with Lando Norris 18th and Daniel Ricciardo 20th, while Aston Martin\u2019s Stroll and Hulkenberg and 15th and 17th respectively. Meanwhile Hamilton goes in for hard compounds but comes out struggling and watches Bottas and Zhou zip past him. Leclerc leads Verstappen by 3.4secs. Lap 11/57: Alonso, back in P10, is asked on the radio how his tyres are. \u201cBad\u201d he snaps. Lap 10/57: Back in P20 is Ricciardo, who had to veer wide early on to avoid an incident ahead of him. Meanwhile Perez spots his chance and picks off Hamilton for fourth using DRS. Lap 8/57: A frustrated Bottas looks to attack Albon, who isn\u2019t having any of it, but the Finn hangs back before going again and picking him off. Leclerc is 2.4sec clears of Verstappen, who has complained of the engine braking in his Red Bull. Lap 6/57: Ocon gets a five-second penalty for the collision with Schumacher. Leclerc and Verstappen have opened up a three-second lead on the chasing pack, the former having fended off the latter\u2019s early attacks. Lap 5/57: Magnussen makes the same mistake again, going too deep into turn one and watching George Russell zip past him into P6. Hamilton is closing in on Sainz in third. Lap 3/57: Magnussen locks up going into turn one and Perez doesn\u2019t hesitate to swoop, ploughing past him into P5. Ocon nudged Schumacher into a spin Lap 2/57: The front two pull away a tad from Sainz in third. Hamilton holds off the advances of Magnussen. Lap 1/57: Leclerc holds his ground through the first couple of turns with Verstappen snapping at his heels. Perez loses two places \u2013 one of them to Hamilton, who starts brightly and aggressively, the other to a keen Magnussen. Russell is up two places, likewise Gasly, while Ocon and Schumacher have collided Bottas has dropped eight places to 14th! The cars are lined up, and we\u2019re nearly under way \u2026 The divers peel off for the formation lap. Everyone has chosen soft tyres bar Lando Norris and Daniel Ricciardo, who have both gone for mediums. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how the FIA phrase it in their report,\u201d says Steve Carbert writes over email, \u201cthey got it hopelessly wrong in Abu Dhabi and the result should be corrected to reflect the positions when the safety car came out. Much damage has been done to the image of Formula One and I for one have lost a lot of enthusiasm for the sport.\u201d Here\u2019s a fairly downcast Toto Wolff: \u201cWe believe the car has potential but the regulations are so different so we\u2019re learning step by step. Today is just another test for us. We\u2019ve had long runs \u2013 some were good, some were bad. We are not where we want to be, we are not fighting for victories.\u201d Tyres. They\u2019re bigger this season, at 18 inches, and every racer now gets a free choice of starting tyres: which is to say, the top 10 no longer have to start on their tyres from Q2 in qualifying. Here\u2019s George Russell: \u201cMorale is good to be honest \u2013 ultimately we are a step behind Ferrari and Red Bull. We know we\u2019ve got an issue but we know what the problem is and that gives us hope we can solve it. We have to go out there today, damage limitation, pick up the pieces, try and get a result out of it and go from there.\u201d Martin Brundle is stalking around the grid collaring anyone he can for an awkward impromptu interview. Christian Horner offers some chirpy platitudes, Zhou Ghanyu offers some even chirpier platitudes, mockney legend Guy Ritchie says he\u2019s backing McLaren and Jools Holland likewise. Bruce Willis shows a sixth sense for irritating media types and discreetly turns his back. Valtteri Bottas, racing for Alfa Romeo this season, impressed in qualifying \u2013 finishing ahead of his Mercedes replacement George Russell. One to keep an eye on today. Covid has also had an impact on this race: Nico Hulkenberg has been called to action by Aston Martin as a last-minute replacement after Sebastien Vettel tested positive, while Daniel Ricciardo qualified in 18th, having missed all three days of testing last week because of a positive test. Lewis Hamilton speaks: \u201cI feel great and I\u2019m honestly just grateful to be back racing, doing what I love. We probably don\u2019t have the performance to keep up with the guys ahead but I\u2019ll be giving it everything we have to maximise. I just want to make it to the end of the race.\u201d But Christian Horner is having none of that. \u201cLet\u2019s not write off Lewis starting just behind us as well,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be pumped up coming into this race as well. So the first lap is going to be crucial. \u2026 and from yesterday\u2019s dramatic qualifying session: Plus reports on the FAI inquiry into the Abu Dhabi controversy \u2026 \u2026 and a nice explainer about how a hit Netflix series has given the entire sport a turbo boost: No shortage of pre-race reading from us. Here\u2019s the scene-setter for the season that lies ahead for Lewis Hamilton: Say cheese! The starting grid in full: 1) Charles Leclerc, Ferrari 2) Max Verstappen, Red Bull 3) Carlos Sainz, Ferrari 4) Sergio Perez, Red Bull 5) Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes 6) Valtteri Bottas, Alfa Romeo 7) Kevin Magnussen, Haas 8) Fernando Alonso, Alpine 9) George Russell, Mercedes 10) Pierre Gasly, AlphaTauri 11) Esteban Ocon, Alpine 12) Mick Schumacher, Haas 13) Lando Norris, McLaren 14) Alex Albon, Williams 15) Zhou Guanyu, Alfa Romeo 16) Yuki Tsunoda, AlphaTauri 17) Nico Hulkenberg, Aston Martin 18) Daniel Ricciardo, McLaren 19) Lance Stroll, Aston Martin 20) Nicholas Latifi, Williams Is a Formula One driver only as good as his car? That\u2019s the question that will have lately been plaguing Lewis Hamilton as he enters the new season looking to banish the memories of Abu Dhabi, safety cars and that bitter last-lap defeat. Hamilton is not only eyeing sweet vengeance but also a record eighth championship \u2013 yet his car, if the early signs are anything to go by, could seriously hamper his chances. Hamilton was in the unfamiliar position yesterday of playing catch-up to his competitors, coming fifth in qualifying in Bahrain \u2013 and his teammate George Russell ninth \u2013 after his Mercedes struggled with \u201cporpoising\u201d, a bouncing induced by a break in downforce on straights, which left him six tenths off pole. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a nightmare to drive,\u201d he griped afterwards, dispelling any suspicions of Mercedes sandbagging in practice. Less aerodynamically beleaguered was reigning champ Max Verstappen, who zipped round the course with characteristic brio in Red Bull\u2019s sleek car \u2013 yet still came out in second behind the fearsome Charles Leclerc, whose Ferrari teammate Carlos Sainz also roared into third. The blink of an eye \u2013 or 0.129secs \u2013 separated the top three. With Ferrari having spent much of last year working on their 2022 car targeting at the new regulations, the team\u2019s long game might be about to pay off. Could it mean a three-way title tussle? And if not, will Mercedes even be in the picture? Those are the wider questions, some clues to which will hopefully be found in the more immediate excitement of today\u2019s curtain-raiser, which inaugurates a raft of new rules \u2013 introduced with the aim of enabling the cars to race closer together for longer. But after yesterday\u2019s showings the smart money will surely be on Leclerc, who likes this circuit: he took pole here and was conformably leading in 2019 only to fall away because of an engine problem. And for a bit of cheer, turn your thoughts to the man starting in seventh. Kevin Magnussen was, a mere month ago, making peace with the idea that his F1 career was over. He had been dropped by Haas in 2020 and had even begun a career in endurance racing, but was recalled after Nikita Mazepin was sacked by the team this month. \u201cIt\u2019s so strange all of this,\u201d grinned Magnussen yesterday. \u201cI had a whole year to 15 months of trying to get used to the fact F1 wasn\u2019t going to be part of my life any more. I kind of got to a good place with that.\u201d Well, welcome back Kevin, and welcome back F1. Stay tuned!",

      "bodyText": "Formula One\u2019s new era could surely not have asked for a more compelling curtain raiser than the drama, triumph and disaster of the season-opener in Bahrain. While Charles Leclerc led a Ferrari one-two with teammate Carlos Sainz, the prancing horse once more at a mighty gallop, their Red Bull rivals were left reeling from the brutal body blow of a double failure for both their cars. Max Verstappen and Sergio P\u00e9rez both retired at the very death, allowing Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes to capitalise with an unlikely place on the podium. The 24-year-old Leclerc ultimately won with a dominant drive from pole at the Bahrain International Circuit but only after a dramatic fight with Verstappen that had looked to be going to the wire only for both Red Bulls to suffer what the team called a \u201cfuel system problem\u201d that put them out. Their late retirements allowed Hamilton and George Russell to grab an against-the-odds third and fourth place for Mercedes, who had been firmly fifth and sixth through the race on pace. Kevin Magnussen was an impressive fifth for Haas on his first race back in F1. Leclerc took the flag after a consummate display, marked by his calm command at the front and his staunch refusal to be cowed when Verstappen came at him. Passed twice in two laps, Leclerc fought back both times to regain the lead and then hold it for a deserved victory. Ferrari, who in effect wrote off the 2021 season in putting all their resources into developing this year\u2019s car, have reaped the benefits. Their engine has made a clear step forward, amply demonstrated by the improvements in other Ferrari-powered teams Haas and Alfa Romeo. \u201cThe last two years have been incredibly difficult for the team,\u201d said Leclerc. \u201cNow, starting in the best way possible.

They\u2019re an impressive side, superbly coached by Ralph Hasenhuttl, and are chasing a more modest treble \u2013 three games against Manchester City in one season without defeat. Both Premier League matches were drawn, but today there has to be a winner. If Ralph denies Pep a third time, he gets to keep him.</p> <p><strong>Kick off </strong>3pm.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/19/southampton-manchester-city-fa-cup-quarter-final-preview\">Southampton v Manchester City: FA Cup quarter-final preview</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>",

Pep\u2019s verdict \u201cIt\u2019s so difficult: Southampton are one of the most well-organised teams we have played this season. They play with incredible intensity and the goal was a consequence of that. We forgot to play in the last 20 minutes of the first half. The second half was much better \u2013 more personality.\u201d Three quarter-finals down, one to go Kevin De Bruyne\u2019s post-match thoughts \u201cIn the first 20 minutes and the last half hour we did well. In between we made too many stupid mistakes. They played well, but we got much better in the second half. The third and fourth were beautiful goals. We want to win every competition we enter; we\u2019re very happy to be in another semi-final and hopefully we\u2019ll win this one.\u201d More FA Cup news I say! Peep peep! The Treble is still on for Manchester City, who move into the semi-finals after a deceptively uncomfortable win at St Mary\u2019s. The scoreline doesn\u2019t tell the story of an excellent game in which Southampton gave as good as they got for 70 minutes. Ultimately - who knew - City\u2019s superior class and depth were decisive. 90 min Two minutes of added time. 89 min Gunodgan\u2019s superb cross somehow evades the diving Sterling, three yards from goal. I can\u2019t decide if that was a bad miss or whether it just dipped under him. 88 min Two more changes for Southampton: Will Smallbone and Ibrahima Diallo replace Oriol Romeu and Mohamed Elyounoussi. 87 min Mahrez could have had a hat-trick since coming on. He runs at the last man Salisu, beats him with a stepover and shoots just wide of the far post. 87 min \u201cHasenhuttl has brought back his waistcoat,\u201d says Thomas Stratford, \u201cwhile in France it seems Poch has gone full Wenger with the touchline outfits?\u201d That\u2019s not an outfit, it\u2019s a sleeping bag for two. 86 min \u201cUgh,\u201d says Rachel Clifton. \u201cMaybe if we had had the players who can actually score on from the beginning, it might have been different?!\u201d Hmm, I don\u2019t know \u2013 Adams missed possibly the best chance of the lot when he came on. Southampton have played really well; City have just been more clinical. 84 min Mahrez twists a defender inside out and rattles a shot that is beaten awya by Forster. Mercy. 83 min Moussa Djenepo comes on for Southampton in place of the superb Stuart Armstrong. 83 min Three more changes for City: Nathan Ake, Fernandinho and Oleksandra Zinchenko replace Joao Cancelo, Rodri and Aymeric Laporte. 80 min \u201cI bet Hasenhuttl got all excited when he heard United were after a German bloke called Ralf,\u201d says Rick Harris. \u201cCourse, Ed Woodward couldn\u2019t hit a barn door with a banjo so they ended up with Rangnick.\u201d Well, his name is Ralph. And he\u2019s Austrian! Cancelo waves a majestic pass into Gundogan with the outside of the right foot. He chests it down and slides the ball to Mahrez on the far side of the area. Mahrez shapes to shoot back across goal and then cracks it past Forster at the near post. This is so harsh on Southampton. It\u2019s harsh on Southampton, who have played superbly, but what an emphatic finish. Salisu\u2019s defensive header rebounded off Foden, standing nearby, and dropped into the D. Foden ran after the ball, waited for it to bounce, and thrashed a sizzling shot into the far corner. Phil Foden settles matters with a belter! 73 min: Great chance for Adams! Elyounoussi kills a crossfield pass beautifully and squares the ball to Adams, who shoots straight at Steffen on the run. Walker-Peters picks up the rebound and wobbles a shot just wide from 20 yards. Southampton have some really good chances today, arguably more than City. 72 min: Chance for Mahrez! Cancelo forces a good pass down the left to Sterling. He cuts inside and curls a cross towards De Bruyne at the far post. Walker-Peters does well to intercept but can only head the ball straight up in the air. It drops onto the right foot of Mahrez, eight yards out, and he screws a volley well wide. 72 min \u201cIf my hunch is correct,\u201d says Peter Oh, \u201cthe introduction of Adams and Broja is about to make Pep throw some extremely contortionistic pretzel shapes.\u201d Is contortionistic a word? It is now! 71 min The City keeper Zack Steffen is booked for timewasting. 70 min A superb corner routine from Southampton. Ward-Prowse, on the right, arrows it to the edge of the area, where Stuart Armstrong hits a sweet strike that is blocked by Rodri. Stuart Armstrong has had an outstanding game. 69 min A quiet spell in the game, with City passing the clock down. 66 min \u201cHands off,\u201d says Ben Tuff of my Hasenhuttl comment in the 58th minute. On that note, Southampton supporters, did you feel pride, frustration or both when you watched Pochettino\u2019s Spurs? And what about when you see ex-players like Mane do so well? Does it depend how long they were at the club? 64 min Foden, just on, has a close-range shot smothered by Stephens (I think). 64 min City see Southampton\u2019s double change and raise it: Riyad Mahrez and Phil Foden come on for Gabriel Jesus and the subdued Jack Grealish. 63 min Southampton make a double change: Che Adams and Armando Broja replace Adam Armstrong and Shane Long. City are back in front. Forster went the right way, to his right, but De Bruyne\u2019s penalty sneaked under him. I think he got a touch on it but it was low and close enough to the corner. 61 min: Penalty to City! Salisu has been penalised for tripping Jesus just inside the area on the right. It\u2019s a soft penalty but a penalty nonetheless, and such a needless challenge. 60 min Salisu\u2019s speculative long pass so nearly puts Long through on goal. Laporte clears but Southampton regain possession and Ward-Prowse whistles a long-range shot that is well held by Steffen. 59 min City are starting to dominate, as they did at this stage of the first half. It\u2019s a hot day, and Southampton have worked their breathable socks off, so fatigue might be a factor. 58 min \u201cSouthampton\u2019s whole season is riding on this game in their quest for the singuple,\u201d says Rick Harris. \u201cI\u2019ve been really impressed with Hasenhuttl\u2019s tactics against the big teams this season and if his team destroy City\u2019s treble hopes you wouldn\u2019t bet against them reaching another final.\u201d Well, you might if they get Liverpool or Chelsea. But I agree with you, Hasenhuttl is a top-class coach. You can never be completely sure, but I think he\u2019s good enough to manage a Big Six team. 57 min De Bruyne curls over from 20 yards. 55 min Both teams have potential matchwinners on the bench: Redmond, Adams and Broja for Southampton; Mahrez, Foden and Bernardo Silva for City. 54 min Ward-Prowse wins the ball in his own half and releases Adam Armstrong on the left with a long crossfield pass. He runs at the last man Walker and hits a tame shot that deflects behind off Stones. 53 min A helluva scramble in the Southampton area. De Bruyne has a close-range shot blocked crucially by Stephens, and then Rodri\u2019s follow-up is deflected over the bar. 49 min Southampton are right in this game. They have been really impressive both in their pressing and passing. 48 min Romeu stabs an excellent ball to find Adam Armstrong in space, 22 yards from goal. He turns, gets the ball out of his feet but then drags a low shot well wide. That was a decent chance. 47 min A reminder that the game will go extra-time and penalties if necessary. Quarter-final replays are so 2016. 46 min Peep peep! City begin the second half. No changes on either side. \u201cCity would gladly pay \u00a32 million a match to keep anyone emailing this MBM off their team sheet,\u201d says Zach Neeley. \u201cI wonder how many matches it would take me to score a goal with City? Teams would quickly start ignoring me with good reason but I still have to get the ball past a world-class keeper, so maybe low 300s?\u201d If they gave you chances like this, you\u2019d find a way. Half-time reading What an excellent half of football. Southampton started well, went behind to a soft goal from Raheem Sterling and briefly looked in danger of being overwhelmed. But they dominated the latter part of the half and deservedly equalised through an own goal from Aymeric Laporte. Stuart Armstrong, who has had a superb half, poked a fine through pass towards Elyounoussi on the right of the area. He shielded the ball from Steffen, turned and slid a low cross that was screwed into his own net by Laporte. A deserved equaliser for Southampton! It\u2019ll be checked for offside but I think he\u2019s okay. 45 min Livramento\u2019s cross is headed well wide by Long. I think he got in Stuart Armstrong\u2019s way, or maybe Armstrong got in his way. 43 min A marvellous cross from Livramento - what a player he is - evades Long, who thinks he was pushed by Walker. Mike Dean disagrees. Southampton eventually win one corner, and then another. Ward-Prowse\u2019s second corner is only cleared as far as Romeu, 15 yards out. His shot on the bounce is well struck but straight at Steffen. 41 min \u201cRob dearest,\u201d says Mac Millings. \u201cIf anyone wants definitive proof that \u00a3300m is too much money for Haaland, I have performed the necessary calculations. Let\u2019s assume that your educated estimate of \u201875 goals before Christmas\u2019 is accurate, and let us therefore project 150 goals a season. Now, based on the fact that even I could score a goal for this City side, that would make me worth \u00a32m. Just have a quiet think about that.\u201d I\u2019ll have a think, but it might not be quiet. 39 min Cancelo manages to foul both Stuart Armstrong and Livramento with the same tackle. Ward-Prowse\u2019s free-kick is headed away by Rodri. 36 min Rodri picks up a loose ball in midfield, moves to within 25 yards of goal and hits a low drive that swerves just wide of the far post. Mike Dean gave a corner, so maybe it took a slight deflection; either way it was very close. 35 min The indefatigable Long presses Laporte to win a throw-in on the right. Stephens\u2019 long throw skims off the head of Cancelo and runs through to Steffen. 34 min Salisu is fine. 33 min Salisu falls awkwardly after an aerial challenge with Grealish. There\u2019s a break in play while he receives treatment. 31 min Southampton are picking their moments to press. They\u2019ve done well to stay in the game because City have been sharp in attack. 27 min: Gundogan hits the post! Grealish breaks infield from the left, uses Cancelo by not using him and then does use him on the outside with a short pass. Cancelo absolutely hammers a cross that is diverted onto the near post by Gundogan in the six-yard box. I haven\u2019t seen a replay but my impression is that, rather than it being a bad miss, Gundogan did well to control the shot at all given the pace of Cancelo\u2019s cross. 26 min \u201c\u00a3300m isn\u2019t too much money for Haaland when you factor in the total cost for Pogba which was around 220 million, with basic salary that is,\u201d says Yash Gupta. \u201cBut considering how poor City were when they made an offer of \u00a375m + \u00a325m for Kane, I expect \u00a325m + Scott Carson would do for Mino Raiola, best player in the world.\u201d You lost me at Scott Carson. 24 min Adam Armstrong misses an excellent chance! Stuart Armstrong slipped a good pass infield to Long, who moved forward and played it to the other Armstrong in the area. He controlled it well on the stretch - it wasn\u2019t a great ball from Long - but then sliced well wide from 15 yards. 22 min The impressive Livramento plays a one-two with Stuart Armstrong and puts in a cross that is cleared by Jesus. 20 min Livramento wins a 50/50, not for the first time today, and curves an early ball around Laporte towards Adam Armstrong. Laporte shows good pace to stay with Armstrong and knock the ball back to Steffen. 19 min Southampton started well but they have struggled since the goal and are in danger of being hypnotised by City\u2019s rhythmic passing. 17 min A poor pass from Romeu is nicked by De Bruyne. He plays it to Jesus, who turns and thrashes over from the edge of the area. City look in the mood. 15 min A brilliant stat on the BBC. This is the 28th time this season that Manchester City have scored the first goal; they\u2019ve won all of the previous 27. 14 min The City fans appeal optimistically for a penalty when Jesus turns into Salisu in the area. Mike Dean isn\u2019t interested. Raheem Sterling gives City the lead after a mistake from Jack Stephens. He failed to clear De Bruyne\u2019s cross properly, instead diverting it meekly to Jesus in the area. He squared it to Sterling, who slid the ball past Forster from 10 yards. Replays show that Sterling\u2019s shot - which was straight at Forster - took a slight but vital touch off the stretching Livramento. 10 min: Adam Armstrong hits the post! So close for Southampton. Romeu opened City up with a lovely through pass towards Armstrong, who made an excellent run from left to right. He screwed a first-time shot back across Steffen, not the cleanest strike, and it hit the inside of the far post. 9 min Sterling misses a decent chance. De Bruyne\u2019s pass from the left was intended for Sterling but ran through to Gundogan instead. He made 25 yards and then played in Sterling on the left side of the area. He watched the ball across his body but sliced it wide of the near post with his left foot. The angle was fairly tight; even so, he should probably have worked Forster. 7 min The first bit of pressure from City. De Bruyne marches infield from the right and has a low left-footed shot blocked by a defender, Stephens I think. 5 min Sterling\u2019s 20-yard curler is comfortably saved to his left by Forster. 4 min Long almost has a chance after a strong run through midfield from Stuart Armstrong. He laid it square to Long, who couldn\u2019t take the ball in his stride on the edge of the area and was eventually tackled by Laporte. Southampton have started well. 3 min \u201cShane Long?!\u201d says Rachel Clifton. \u201cWhy?\u201d Off-the-ball running I guess; plus he\u2019s been a part of the FA Cup team for most of the season. But yes, I did expect Adams and Broja to start rather than Long and Armstrong. 2 min City have started with Grealish as their false nine. Jesus is on the right, Sterling to the left. 1 min Peep peep! Southampton kick off from left to right. City are in their very very very very very very very very dark blue third kit. The players stroll out of the tunnel, into the sunshine. It\u2019s a lovely day in Southampton, and you\u2019ll be pleased to hear that Ralph Hasenhuttl is wearing his waistcoat. \u201cGiven City\u2019s reluctance to pay the \u00a3150m that would by all accounts have prised Kane away from Spurs it is nonsense to suggest they would pay double that for a 21-year-old who doesn\u2019t actually suit the Guardiola style,\u201d says Rick Harris. \u201cThere was a brief period last year when I thought the Solskjaer connection might bring him to Old Trafford, but I reckon Bayern will see him as the natural successor to Lewandowski and for a player comfortable in the Bundesliga that would be the more obvious destination for Haaland.\u201d Isn\u2019t \u00a3300m the total package rather than the fee? I have no idea where he\u2019ll end up, though I\u2019d be loath to rule City out. Here\u2019s Barney Ronay\u2019s report on a mismatch at Selhurst Park \u201cFor all the City-need-a-real striker chat,\u201d begins Zach Neeley, \u201cthey\u2019ve won three of the last four titles, were fiddling and a broken bone in the face of their best player from a European title last year, and the team that\u2019s the difference from them strolling to five leagues in a row also doesn\u2019t have a real striker. Maybe strikers are overrated! (Not for me, I\u2019m an Arsenal fan, getting desperate.)\u201d I agree with pretty much everything you say, but equally I can\u2019t see how it harms City if Haaland turns up and scores 75 goals before Christmas. Be very afraid We know two of the semi-finalists already. Chelsea went through yesterday and will be joined by Crystal Palace, who are hammering Everton at Selhurst Park. The teams in formation Southampton (4-2-2-2) Forster; Livramento, Stephens, Salisu, Walker-Peters; Romeu, Ward-Prowse; S Armstrong, Elyounoussi; Long, A Armstrong. Substitutes: Caballero, Valery, Perraud, Diallo, Smallbone, Redmond, Djenepo, Adams, Broja. Manchester City (4-1-2-3) Steffen; Walker, Stones, Laporte, Cancelo; Rodri; De Bruyne, Gundogan; Jesus, Sterling, Grealish. Substitutes: Carson, Ake, Zinchenko, Bernardo, Fernandinho, Mahrez, Foden. FA Cup specialist Shane Long, 35, gets a rare start up front for Southampton. That\u2019s one of four changes from last weekend\u2019s defeat against Watford. Tino Livramento, Jack Stephens and Alan Armstrong also come in, with Romain Perraud, Will Smallbone, Che Adams and Jan Bednarek dropping out. All bar Bednarek are on the bench. Pep Guardiola also makes four changes from the Manchester City side that drew with Crystal Palace on Monday. Zack Steffen, Ilkay Gundogan, Gabriel Jesus and Raheem Sterling replace Ederson, Bernardo Silva, Phil Foden and Riyad Mahrez. City have only named seven substitutes from a possible nine. Thoughts with Manchester City at this difficult time. Usually at this stage of the season they are chasing a quadruple. This year it\u2019s merely a treble \u2013 but it\u2019s the Treble, a potential upgrade on their domestic hat-trick of 2018-19. If all goes to plan they have another 17 games remaining \u2013 nine in the league, five in the Champions League and three in the FA Cup. The first of those is an awkward trip to Southampton, who, like City, reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup last season. They\u2019re an impressive side, superbly coached by Ralph Hasenhuttl, and are chasing a more modest treble \u2013 three games against Manchester City in one season without defeat. Both Premier League matches were drawn, but today there has to be a winner. If Ralph denies Pep a third time, he gets to keep him. Kick off 3pm.",

The move would be a first sign that the government is willing to toughen its approach to authoritarian regimes in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. In an interview at the weekend, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, said the west still needed to apply pressure on the Chinese government not to support the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A backbench amendment already passed in the Lords and sponsored by the former Conservative chief whip, Lord Blencathra, is gaining support across the political spectrum in the Conservative party, including some One Nation MPs, as well as traditional Tory opponents of the Chinese regime. The amendment to the health and social care bill passed with cross-party support, but little fanfare, in the Lords earlier this month. It will be debated when the bill returns to the Commons, most likely in the week beginning 28 March. It would ban NHS procurement from regions where the government believes there to be a \u201cserious risk of genocide\u201d. Ministers have already tried to buy off the rebels by proposing a review of health supply chains, but now may go further and promise not to procure goods from Xinjiang on grounds of risk of forced labour. The Foreign Office has resisted any proposal that requires anyone save the international courts to decide unequivocally if genocide is taking place, including in Xinjiang. It has fiercely opposed the UK domestic courts, or ministers, being given that role. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, is said to be keen to clean up health supply chains, but may come under pressure from the Foreign Office not to do anything that disturbs relations with China at a sensitive time. Yet pressures are also building for a tougher approach. At the weekend, in an interview with the Times, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said the west had in the past focused too much on cheap goods at the expense of freedom and security. It is known that the government has bought hundreds of millions of pounds of medical equipment sourced in whole or part from China\u2019s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, despite widespread reports of forced labour there \u2013 facts that are not denied by the government. Conservative MP Nusrat Ghani said: \u201cI hope the government will take ownership of this important initiative. It is awful to think that PPE we have been wearing through this pandemic may have been made by Uyghur forced labour. We have a duty to protect the NHS from involvement in the heinous things done to Uyghur people. This amendment is a proportionate and reasonable way of keeping the UK away from it.\u201d Blencathra\u2019s amendment was phrased so as not to require the UK to announce that there is genocide in Xinjiang, but that may not satisfy Foreign Office policy objections. The UK government is already bound to assess its suppliers for a risk of slavery, and this extra duty would mandate that an assessment of a \u201cserious risk\u201d of genocide is performed by the government and taken into account during public procurement. The amendment has the support of the British Medical Association, a strong advocate of public procurement as a means of protecting ethical standards.",

A few minutes earlier he had secured a victory, when forcing Rodrigo Vargas to submit, which fulfilled his prediction of a first-round stoppage. His great friend, and \u201cbig sister\u201d from Liverpool, \u201cMeatball\u201d Molly McCann, had already produced an even more remarkable finish with a stunning third-round knockout which lit up the 0<sub>2</sub> Arena in London on a transformative night for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/19/fighting-for-liverpool-paddy-the-baddy-and-meatball-mollys-ufc-takeover\">the garrulous scouse duo and British MMA</a>.</p> <p>There were seven British winners on the night, including another impressive first-round stoppage for the heavyweight Tom Aspinall, and the UFC president, Dana White, described it afterwards as the most enjoyable promotion in the history of his organisation. White was so caught up in the fevered atmosphere that he made the unprecedented decision to award <a href=\"https://www.ufc.com/news/ufc-bonus-coverage-2022-performance-fight-of-the-night\">a $50,000 bonus</a> to the winner of every one of the nine bouts which ended in a stoppage \u2013 rather than rewarding just one fighter on the night.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e288b53a2648eb25e736c9989dd7a0dd2b6ea49f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e288b53a2648eb25e736c9989dd7a0dd2b6ea49f/0_0_5060_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paddy Pimblett dances to celebrate his first-round submission victory over Rodrigo Vargas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paddy Pimblett dances to celebrate his first-round submission victory over Rodrigo Vargas</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was no doubt, however, that this was the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theufcbaddy/status/1505546624843411459\">Paddy and Molly Show</a> as the two highly distinctive fighters from Liverpool lived up to their pre-fight hype. In only his second UFC contest, Pimblett received an ecstatic reception as he strutted to the octagon. His floppy blond mop-top, goofy grin and pale lightweight frame, devoid of a single tattoo, means that Pimblett looks so unlike a traditional UFC fighter. Vargas, his imposing opponent from Mexico, glowered menacingly but the 27-year-old from a council estate in Huyton kept grinning.</p> <p>The switch in Pimblett\u2019s cheerful mood came only a minute before the cage door shut when he was introduced. Rather than acknowledging the crowd Pimblett looked suddenly concentrated as he stared back at the Mexican who had promised to teach him a harsh lesson. Vargas started with intent and a hard right hand rocked Pimblett. After 18 seconds of the contest Vargas had taken Pimblett down and pinned him to the canvas as the Mexican drew on his upper-body strength and jiu-jitsu skills.</p> <p>Pimblett\u2019s explosive striking had sealed a first-round victory on his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVFu8FsRGak\">UFC debut in Las Vegas</a> in September but, throughout his MMA career, his submission work on the ground has been exceptional. He had also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2022/mar/19/ufc-london-paddy-pimblett-and-molly-mccanns-fight-night-preparations\">spent weeks in training camp</a> working on his grappling and had flown in a leading American wrestler, Chasen Blair, at his own expense to develop his skillset.</p> <p>There was still a sense of jeopardy and a hush fell across the arena as a transfixed crowd waited to see if Pimblett could escape the tightening grip of Vargas. Slowly, inexorably, Pimblett began to wrest back control. There was a roar as Pimblett broke sufficiently free so that he could gain enough leverage to rise to his feet \u2013 and they continued grappling in upright positions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6fb02ff47c256aab558f4975763502e762598aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6fb02ff47c256aab558f4975763502e762598aa/0_0_5206_3371/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paddy Pimblett starts to celebrate his quick victory.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"648\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paddy Pimblett starts to celebrate his quick victory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then, three minutes into the first round, the contest changed dramatically as Pimblett\u2019s left leg wrapped around Vargas\u2019 sturdy limbs and he completed a slick judo move which allowed him to throw the Mexican to the canvas.

Get us to Anfield and we\u2019ll fill it.\u201d</p> <p>White confirmed that the success of Saturday night\u2019s promotion meant the UFC would return to the UK later this year.

Will everyone sing with me?\u201d He turned to the crowd and led the chant: <em>\u201cJust-tice for the 97 \u2026 Just-tice for the 97 \u2026\u201d </em>Meatball Molly, with an Everton scarf draped around her neck, joined the singing. She was still reeling in delight after a milestone performance less than an hour earlier.</p> <p>Facing Luana Carolina, a Brazilian woman with a considerable reach advantage, McCann had been dominant in the opening round. She looked close to sealing an early stoppage with her superior punching as blood seeped from Carolina\u2019s face. McCann also expended so much energy, on such an emotionally charged night, and her intensity dropped a little in the second round even though she again won it clearly.</p> <p>Carolina had five minutes left in the third and final round to salvage her night but McCann was intent on closing the show. A straight left jolted Carolina who, defiantly, beckoned McCann to come at her again. The Liverpool fighter did not need any invitation. Stalking the taller Brazilian, she waited for her moment. When Carolina raised her left knee, McCann shaped to grab it before, ducking and swivelling away, she spun around in a tight circle and completed the most stunning move of the night. Her back elbow crashed into the face of her stricken opponent. Carolina was out cold even before she hit the canvas, her arms spread wide in utter oblivion. McCann wheeled away, her mouth open in amazement and joy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"32456f4d0afd3ba67a19c0f345d7e72a06dee951\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32456f4d0afd3ba67a19c0f345d7e72a06dee951/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Molly McCann knocks out Luala Carolina with a stunning spinning elbow to win the bout\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Molly McCann knocks out Luala Carolina with a stunning spinning elbow to win the bout.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She confirmed in the octagon that the spinning back elbow stoppage, which is so rare, had been a move \u201cwe drilled every day\u201d in the gym.

      "bodyText": "Having kids is a process full of joy and wonder. How do their little brains work? How did I grow a central nervous system? Why is there a spatula in my shower? There are so many things to learn and so much knowledge that seems to be embedded in your bones when caring for children. Some skills and approach to child-rearing comes from a visceral instinct and there are thousands of books and social media accounts that offer advice and doctrines about how to do it right. Everyone warns you about the sleep deprivation, responsibility and the costs; however, no one seems to mention the fun, the stuff your kids will do every day that makes you laugh out loud and the ecstasy of being the preferred parent. But there are a few things that I wish someone had pulled me aside and told me. So let me try and share my hard-earned wisdom. Here are a few things I wish I had known before I became a parent: 1 ) There is no pregnancy glow.

      "body": "<p>Nobody had reason to pay undue attention to Bronius \u201cBob\u201d Sredersas after he arrived in Wollongong in 1950, one among thousands of postwar European migrants who helped grow the Illawarra\u2019s Port Kembla steelworks into the biggest in the Commonwealth.</p> <p>Sredersas, 39 when he arrived in Australia aboard the Fairsea liner, initially lived for two years at <a href=\"https://mhpillawarra.com.au/?p=127\">Unanderra migrant hostel</a>. He then bought a small block and built a house in what was Hoskins Street, Cringila \u2013 a humble Wollongong workers\u2019 suburb of unmade roads and fibros in the shadows of the steelworks\u2019 monolithic, ever-exhaling smoke stacks and blast furnaces.</p> <p>The quiet Lithuanian daily walked the couple of hundred metres to the steelworks where he toiled, initially as a labourer and later as a crane driver, until his retirement at 65 in 1975. Sredersas \u2013 \u201cMr Bob\u201d to Cringila locals \u2013 kept to himself. He avoided the rowdy, bustling pubs of Port Kembla, nightly jammed with post-shift steelworkers and wharfies for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_o%27clock_swill\">six o\u2019clock swill</a>. He steered clear of the horses, wasn\u2019t interested in football or cricket.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"4a5b42a543234adcf529e245b79525361945a222\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a5b42a543234adcf529e245b79525361945a222/0_0_6848_3660/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The steelworks at Port Kembla, Wollongong,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"534\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The steelworks at Port Kembla.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A devout Catholic, he worshipped regularly, tended his cabbages, roses and lemons at the tiny cottage he shared with his cat, Mitzi. On weekends he\u2019d cycle down to Port Kembla harbour to fish and later share his catch with Mitzi.</p> <p>Neighbours and local kids were fond of him. A neighbour of 24 years once recounted: \u201cMy two girls loved him. All the local children played in his garden. His pockets were always full of sweets and when a child hurt itself while playing, it would run to Mr Bob for sympathy.\u201d</p> <p>Kind, gentle, avuncular, distinctive in his dark beret and often with pipe or cigarette in mouth, Bob Sredersas was the model citizen \u2013 and the ideal migrant success story.</p> <p>People about Cringila would occasionally observe him returning from the station carrying brown paper packages. Without a family to raise and having avoided drinking his earnings, on days off from the steelworks he would catch the old diesel train to Sydney where, from 1956, he attended fine art auctions. Using McCulloch\u2019s Encyclopedia of Australian Art as a guide, he amassed during the next two decades an extraordinary collection of Australian fine visual art, including paintings by Grace Cossington Smith, Arthur Streeton, Margaret Preston, William Ashton, Henry Buckmaster and Norman Lindsay.</p> <p>All available wall space in his cottage was adorned with his remarkable collection. He also owned many ivory pieces and Indigenous works from Papua New Guinea. But after a break-in and the theft of some works, and cognisant that he had nobody to leave the art to, from 1976 he made the benefaction that unavoidably thrust him into the limelight of local and national celebration: he gave the entire collection of some 100 works to the city of Wollongong.</p> <p>Sredersas has since been <a href=\"https://www.australianlithuanians.org/arts/bob-sredersas/\">celebrated by the city</a> and the Australian Lithuanian community, including with special guest lectures and dinners, with a gallery space in his name, a special plaque honouring his generosity, and with several exhibitions. He has been lauded in local and state media, his bequest shorthanded simply as \u201cThe Gift\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7138296516d31d576a3908e9afb83552ada3f46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7138296516d31d576a3908e9afb83552ada3f46/0_0_6053_4085/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Art Gallery of Wollongong.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"675\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Wollongong Art Gallery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sredersas\u2019 philanthropy, upon which the city built a fine art collection and opened the <a href=\"http://www.wollongongartgallery.com/gallery/Pages/History.aspx\">Wollongong Art Gallery</a> (one of regional Australia\u2019s finest) in 1978, earned him an almost mythical status as a cultural hero \u2013 the selfless migrant intent on repaying the community that harboured him from war-ravaged Europe.</p> <p>\u201cI have nobody but the people of Wollongong to leave them [the artworks] to. They are for the young people to learn, for old people to enjoy, and for me it\u2019s the realisation of a life\u2019s dedication,\u201d Sredersas said.</p> <p>\u201cIt was always my dream to see paintings in a gallery here. When I came to Wollongong there were many factories, buildings and bridges. People before me had built them. But I too can do something for future generations. You must not forget that we are only temporarily in this world but the human race will stay. Something must be done for future generations, future citizens.\u201d</p> <p>But four decades after his death, a more sinister picture of Sredersas\u2019 life is emerging, a life he concealed from those that knew him in Australia.</p> <p>In 2018, former Wollongong councillor Michael Samaras suspected something was not quite right with the Sredersas story and started digging. This summer he uncovered new archival evidence from Lithuania suggesting that during the second world war Sredersas served in the intelligence arm of the Nazi SS, which was instrumental in systematically slaughtering 212,000 Lithuanian Jews.</p> <p>If the evidence can be upheld, should Sredersas\u2019 name be stripped from the regional gallery that built itself on his gift? Should the plaque at the gallery be removed or amended to explain the institution\u2019s most prized collection was donated by an apparent Nazi collaborator and possible war criminal? Is it even possible to distinguish the collection from the man, who in his new life in Australia managed to mystify his war years?</p> <p>The City of Wollongong \u2013 and its exceptional art gallery \u2013 has much to contemplate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"caf670e43bc086b92db8788330bacd8f2c4d70c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/caf670e43bc086b92db8788330bacd8f2c4d70c3/0_0_6252_4063/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Samaras in front of steelworks at Port Kembla.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"650\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Samaras in front of steelworks at Port Kembla.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>***</p> <p>The Gift inevitably brought Bob Sredersas the type of attention he\u2019d always carefully evaded. His almost four decades in Europe \u2013 especially his war years \u2013 were at best enigmatic. \u201cBronius Sredersas chose not to talk about his youth, his experiences in the second world war and as a displaced person. He simply preferred to consider that his life began with his arrival in Australia,\u201d reads an essay in a 1989 Wollongong City Gallery (now Wollongong Art Gallery) exhibition catalogue about Sredersas.</p> <p>To mark its 40th anniversary in 2018 the gallery mounted an exhibition, The Gift \u2013 Remembering Bob Sredersas. Its catalogue essay tells of a man born to a privileged family in 1910 in Simferopol, on the Crimean peninsula, on 4 December 1910, who grew up in newly independent Lithuania and as a young man worked for the state police in criminal intelligence.</p> <p>The essay continues: \u201cHis service record abruptly ends at the time of the [first] Russian occupation \u2026 and Bob\u2019s story goes quiet during the second world war; his Australian immigration papers stating that he worked as a farm labourer and emphatically that he did not work as a policeman or soldier. Personal recollections of those who knew Bob in later years in Australia all agree on his reticence to talk about himself and his past, which only adds to the mystery and intrigue surrounding this time in his life.\u201d</p> <p>Mystery and intrigue now seem an understatement amid the emerging evidence about his wartime activities.<strong> </strong>In a place where perhaps half of the employees in the local industry \u2013 especially the steelworks \u2013 were \u201cnew Australians\u201d who had arrived soon after the war, and the understated Lithuanian always seemed to avoid answering a critical question while alive: what, precisely, did you do in the war, Bob?</p> <p>In death, he was close to beatified, his reputation for beneficence enhanced when he bequeathed his Cringila home to the local Catholic archdiocese \u201cfor assisting and educating underprivileged and destitute children\u201d.</p> <p>The Sredersas legacy for modest benevolence, for the virtue of hard work and humility, and for thanking a community that gave him a new life, was irresistible for the town built on steel and the sweat of migrants.</p> <p>\u201cBob Sredersas\u2019 story is probably the most gentle and beautiful of all the folklore that migrants have established in the steel town,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.bhp.com/-/media/project/bhp1ip/bhp-com-en/documents/about/our-history/180101_ourhistory100yearsofgrowingaustralia.pdf\">reads an article</a> in a 1985 special edition magazine celebrating the 100th anniversary of steelworks owner BHP.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"53c0b898dd5e365aa4f47e8680015193208dfee2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53c0b898dd5e365aa4f47e8680015193208dfee2/0_0_3543_2313/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tug boats at Port Kembla Bay, Port Kembla, Wollongong.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"653\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tug boats at Port Kembla Bay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This folklore<em> </em>became central to Wollongong\u2019s view of itself. The thing about folklore, of course, is that its bedrock is often myth \u2013 story. And story often turns out to be quite different to truth and the raw materials of so much sound history: documentary evidence.</p> <p>Testimony to the enduring reverence for the old man is manifest in the Sredersas Gallery in the city\u2019s art gallery. Upstairs in the gallery (elegantly transformed from the city\u2019s former council chambers) a wall plaque celebrates \u201cThe Bob Sredersas Gift\u201d. Celebratory dinners were held in his name and occasional historical lectures delivered in his honour (including by <a href=\"https://press.anu.edu.au/publications/series/anu-lives-series-biography/dictionary-world-biography\">Barry Jones</a> and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/donald-hornes-lucky-country-and-the-decline-of-the-public-intellectual-80743\">Donald Horne</a>).</p> <p>The local studies section of the Wollongong Library also celebrates Sredersas. Its collection includes three curated boxes of his personal documentation (including birth certificates and migration papers) as well as his prosaic accoutrements \u2013 eye glasses and pipe, beret and crucifix.</p> <p>Wollongong attained something like peak Bob Sredersas with the 40th anniversary of the city\u2019s art gallery in 2018. There was a resurgence of media coverage about Sredersas\u2019s life and times, and a special exhibition to honour him. The gallery even elaborately recreated part of his home (replete with Australian masterpieces on the walls and with other brown paper-wrapped works stacked at floor level) in a tribute akin to the <a href=\"https://gallery.tweed.nsw.gov.au/visit/margaret-olley-art-centre\">Tweed Regional Gallery\u2019s celebration</a> of Margaret Olley\u2019s life and work.</p> <p>An evocative video was produced. It features an actor playing Sredersas speaking of his gift. \u201cI am Bob. Just Bob,\u201d the Sredersas character says.</p> <p>But now it seems that wasn\u2019t true. He was, apparently, much more. </p> <p>That is when 58-year-old Samaras, the son of a Greek immigrant father who worked as an industrial painter at the steelworks, and born and bred in Wollongong, started to become deeply suspicious.</p> <p>\u201cI decided to find out for myself exactly who he really was,\u201d Samaras says.</p> <p>***</p> <p>From the time of The Gift,<em> </em>when Michael Samaras was about 12, he lived in a Wollongong reverent of Sredersas. \u201cI read the local paper, the Illawarra Mercury, every day as a kid. So, yes, I knew the story of Sredersas and The Gift intimately \u2013 it had been repeated and repeated and repeated. He became such an important figure in the local community and he still is,\u201d says Samaras, a former Labor member of Wollongong council and longtime supporter of the gallery, as we drive about his old town, where his father still lives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"043ef2c12ff7c665b02da9e84b35867bf1a9c914\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/043ef2c12ff7c665b02da9e84b35867bf1a9c914/0_0_3307_2086/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The house at 48 Merrett Avenue, Carigila, Port Kembla, Wollongong, where Bornius\u201dBob\u201d Srederas used to live.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"631\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The house at 48 Merrett Avenue, Cringila, where Bornius \u2018Bob\u2019 Sredersas used to live.

At the bottom of the street is one of the many gates into the steelworks, its monolithic chimneys belching smoke. Today it employs barely 2,000 people, compared with 22,000 in its heyday when Sredersas was there.</p> <p>We drive out of Sredersas\u2019s old street towards Port Kembla, past thoroughfares named in honour of other proud steel cities: Birmingham Street, Bethlehem Street, Newcastle Street. There is also a Steel Street.</p> <p>We drive through Port Kembla\u2019s heart along Wentworth Street, past those old workers\u2019 pubs that Sredersas avoided so he could buy art instead, past elegant cafes and shops selling clothes and antiques that signal a renaissance in this part of the Illawarra.</p> <p>Samaras says: \u201cThey\u2019ve been honouring his benefaction for decades. It\u2019s been in local media repeatedly \u2026 His story is part of Wollongong. It\u2019s central to the story of people coming here from Europe, postwar, building new lives, making a community, contributing. You know, all that hard work amid the smoke and pollution, investing his money in art and towards the end of his life leaving a legacy to the city. So, it\u2019s a lovely story and you can see why people have embraced it. It\u2019s the sort of story a city loves to tell itself. But it\u2019s a fairytale. There\u2019s a dark side that needs to be revealed and examined.\u201d</p> <p>We stop along the harbour, where fishers stand with their rods (as Sredersas once did) on the rocks with their backs to the steelworks: a melange of russet and sable and coal-black metallic horizontals and colliding verticals of conveyors, warehouses, cranes, smoke stacks and walkways. White fumes twist and bellow skywards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"555306009dc2feec206c03259cae0e26f16f2106\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/555306009dc2feec206c03259cae0e26f16f2106/0_0_3418_2133/1000.jpg\" alt=\"City Beach Wollongong with the Port Kembla steelworks in the background.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"624\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">City Beach in Wollongong, with the Port Kembla steelworks in the background.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cDuring all that publicity for the <a href=\"https://www.aasd.com.au/index.cfm/news/754-how-a-humble-steel-labourer-showed-up-two-prosperous-mining-magn\">40th anniversary of the gallery</a>,\u201d Samaras says, \u201cthere was mention that Sredersas had been a police officer in Lithuania [before the German occupation]. And that\u2019s what made me think, \u2018Hang on \u2013 I know what the auxiliary police battalions got up to in Lithuania: they murdered the Jews. It was as if an alarm bell went off in my head.\u201d</p> <p>Samaras was especially struck by a <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-26/how-a-lithuanian-intelligence-officer-helped-establish-a-gallery/9799460\">local ABC article</a> at the time. It included the thought-provoking lines: \u201cThe apparent double life of the Lithuanian migrant, who went from being an intelligence officer in his home country to a steelworker in New South Wales, remains shrouded in mystery 36 years after his death.</p> <p>\u201cMr Sredersas came from a middle-class family in the northern European country and went on to work as a policeman for the Lithuanian government\u2019s department of security, where he was tasked with monitoring Soviet military activity. His involvement with the civil service ended abruptly in 1940 when the Russians invaded Lithuania, prompting Mr Sredersas to flee, in fear for his life, to Germany.\u201d</p> <p>Samaras went through the archive at the Wollongong Library to confirm, via the translated Russian identity documents, Sredersas\u2019s personal details \u2013 including his christening name (Bronislav Schreders), date of birth (4 December 1910), place of birth (Simferopol, Crimea), and his parents\u2019 particulars. Samaras sent these details to the Lithuanian Special Archive in Vilnius together with \u201cBronius Sredersas\u201d, the (Lithuanian) name on his migration papers for entry to Australia in 1950. Samaras asked for any details about Schreders/Sredersas in Lithuania during the period 1940-44.</p> <p>The Lithuanian archive includes Russian KGB files. The KGB archives, most of which were collated after the Soviet Union reoccupied Lithuania from the Nazis in 1944, have detailed dossiers \u2013 based in part on records of interviews with Nazi collaborators and abandoned German records of those who served the Third Reich in implementing anti-Jewish (Holocaust) and anti-Russian policies.</p> <p>It is a long-accepted part of the Sredersas life story that he worked as a police officer in an intelligence unit before the first Soviet occupation.</p> <p>\u201cHis safety was at risk as a result of his employment by the Lithuanian security department in monitoring military activity prior to the invasion,\u201d according to the Wollongong City Gallery\u2019s 1989 exhibition catalogue.</p> <p>Sredersas emerges in all the publicity about his life post-The Gift as opaque about his war years. He was vague about whether he\u2019d fled to Germany along with many Lithuanian nationalists after the first Soviet occupation of Lithuania in August 1940, which ended with the Nazi invasion of June-July 1941 \u2013 or after the Soviet reoccupation of Lithuania in July 1944. (Having worked for Lithuanian intelligence, he would certainly have been a target.)</p> <p>According again to that exhibition catalogue, Sredersas was apparently \u201clabouring on the riverboats in Kaunas\u201d, Lithuania\u2019s temporary capital, in 1944.</p> <p>Regardless, after the war he was registered as a displaced person, migrated to Australia and lived an unassuming, modest life based on hard work and gratitude towards his adoptive country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d0dfee2750acc8c1a12e5256ed26f2887023c8d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0dfee2750acc8c1a12e5256ed26f2887023c8d5/0_0_4488_3050/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The view down Wentworth Street, to the steelworks, Port Kembla.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"680\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The view down Wentworth Street, to the Port Kembla steelworks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A long-time associate of Sredersas reportedly said: \u201cHe was wanted at times by the Russians and the Germans, so it\u2019s pretty cloudy as to what his movements were in the war years.\u201d</p> <p>Cloudy indeed. Until, that is, officials at the Lithuanian archives responded to Samaras this summer. The records they produced \u2013 an application form, resume and related documents on SS stock \u2013 bear the name Bronislaw Shroeders rather than Bronislav Shreders, but the remaining details \u2013 date and place of birth and parents\u2019 names \u2013 match up with the birth records.</p> <p>\u201cThe documents show Sredersas was employed by the SD \u2013 Sicherheitsdienst \u2013 which was the intelligence agency of the [Nazi] SS [Schutzstaffel]. I also received a copy of his enlistment papers for the SS,\u201d Samaras says.</p> <p>During the German occupation of Lithuania from June 1941 to July 1944 the Nazis \u2013 abetted by Lithuanian authorities, including the state\u2019s police services and the SD \u2013 killed 96.4% (212,000) of the country\u2019s Jews, most in the latter part of 1941 but also until the Soviet reoccupation in 1944. The Lithuanian police auxiliaries were so effective at shooting Jews en masse that some were deployed to other countries including Ukraine and Belarus to carry out mass killing of Jewish people and to guard concentration camps.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"87a42d2822db43f924c92bd021ad1c7abf7d0397\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87a42d2822db43f924c92bd021ad1c7abf7d0397/0_0_919_615/500.jpg\" alt=\"Bornius\u201dBob\u201d Sredersas donated a large art collection to the Wollongong Art Gallery.\" width=\"500\" height=\"335\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bornius \u2018Bob\u2019 Sredersas donated a large art collection to the Wollongong Art Gallery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ABC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Initially Samaras used an online translation tool to interpret the Lithuanian archival documents that implicate Sredersas. To further verify them, he sent the documents to the Simon Wiesenthal Centre\u2019s Efraim Zuroff, the world\u2019s leading \u201cNazi hunter\u201d who has traced surviving and dead alleged second world war German war criminals to numerous countries, <a href=\"https://thewest.com.au/news/perth/accused-perth-war-criminal-charles-zentai-was-a-loving-man-claim-family-ng-b88695878z\">including Australia</a>. Zuroff confirmed to Samaras that the documents show Sredersas worked for the SD and applied to join the SS. They don\u2019t indicate if the application was successful.</p> <p>Zuroff told the Guardian: \u201cIn 1943, he was working as a criminal investigator in Kovno [Kaunas] for the SD. By 7 November 1943, he had acquired German citizenship and applied to join the SS as a volunteer. In summation, he was an active participant in enforcing German directives and orders, and most likely was able to join the Waffen-SS, where he very likely participated in Holocaust crimes.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that in 1943, he worked as a criminal investigator for the German Sicherheitsdienst in Kaunas means that he was involved in implementing German policy regarding the Jews, ie the Holocaust. The question is how long did he serve there? If, for example, he already served there in the second half of 1941, when most of the murders of Jews in Lithuania were carried out, then there is no doubt about his involvement in Holocaust crimes.\u201d</p> <p>Zuroff pointed out that the commander of the German SD in Lithuania was \u201cnone other than the mass murderer Karl J\u00e4ger, author of the infamous <a href=\"http://bit.ly/JagerReport\">J\u00e4ger Report</a>, which documented the mass murder of over 137,000 Lithuanian Jews from early July until the end of November 1941\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAny person who served in the SD in Kaunas almost certainly was involved in the persecution and murder of Jews. If he served there during the period from July 1941 until the end of November 1941, there\u2019s no doubt whatsoever. But even if he only served in that unit later, it\u2019s a reasonable assumption that he was involved in mistreating the Jews,\u201d Zuroff says.</p> <p>\u201cAs far as serving in the Waffen-SS, that might have included mistreatment of \u2018enemies of the Reich\u2019 as well, but not necessarily. In any event those units were fighting for a victory of the Third Reich, the most genocidal regime in history.\u201d</p> <p>According to Sredersas\u2019 International Refugee Organization papers held at the National Archives of Australia, he was consistently in Lithuania until the Soviet reoccupation in 1944, though from August 1940 he insisted he was largely unemployed (with the exception of six months to June 1944, when he says he was a \u201cseaman\u201d).</p> <p>This is at odds with his apparent application to join the Waffen-SS as a volunteer in November 1943 when he listed his current place of work as \u201cSD\u201d \u2013 the intelligence organisation of the SS.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"479b842381326ec2b5ee38b59df66aaedbffa233\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/479b842381326ec2b5ee38b59df66aaedbffa233/0_0_4488_2992/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mound of coal and big tree by Port Kembla.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If he thought the gift would soothe his conscience, I hope it didn\u2019t work,\u2019 Samaras says.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>***</p> <p>In January Samaras alerted the Wollongong Art Gallery\u2019s director, John Monteleone, to the documents about Sredersas and Zuroff\u2019s interpretation of them. There is no suggestion that until the gallery \u2013 and then council \u2013 received these documents and Zuroff\u2019s assessment that they or anyone else knew of suggestions Sredersas was a member of the SD, had applied to join the SS or could have been involved in anti-Jewish Holocaust activities during the war.</p> <p>Samaras suggested the gallery consult an expert to examine the documents (possibly the Sydney Jewish Museum or Zuroff) and to reconsider its close association with the Sredersas name.</p> <p>\u201cAs you know I am a supporter of the Wollongong Art Gallery and understand that this information will come as a shock to many people,\u201d Samaras wrote to Monteleone.</p> <p>\u201cOnce you have had time to consider, I suggest we talk again to consider the best way to make this information public, and the next appropriate steps.\u201d</p> <p>The gallery director said he would consult the council, which operates the gallery.</p> <p>A week later a council bureaucrat wrote to Samaras: \u201cThank you for the information \u2013 I understand you are deeply concerned about the gallery\u2019s reputation. On balance, given the lack of clear evidence in this case, it is not deemed appropriate for council \u2013 as a local government body \u2013 to undertake such an investigative role as suggested. As such, council does not propose to take any further steps in this matter as this time.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday, a council spokesperson said it would not be appropriate for the council to comment on allegations made against a private individual: \u201cCouncil understands it would be the responsibility of the federal police to investigate such allegations.\u201d</p> <p>In relation to Sredersas\u2019 bequest it said that \u201cstandard industry processes were followed for the donation of these artworks. As a result, these artworks were accepted in good faith.\u201d</p> <p>Asked for comment, Monteleone did not personally respond, but the council spokesperson said the council\u2019s response also represented the position of the gallery.</p> <p>Samaras is not satisfied.</p> <p>\u201cI want them to address this properly. That is not going to happen overnight \u2013 I know that. They are a public institution and they need to go through a process \u2013 a journey. I think they should get a report written perhaps by the Simon Wiesenthal Centre or by the Sydney Jewish Museum that actually explains what happened in Lithuania and puts the documents in context so that the story is properly understood.</p> <p>\u201cThey can then engage the community, which knows the Sredersas legend, and say, \u2018Well, we honoured this man for 46 years but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to honour him any more.\u2019 They should change the name of the room from the Sredersas Gallery and take down the plaque that honours him. Then they have to tell the story of who he really was.\u201d</p> <p>Wollongong\u2019s beloved story about its modest philanthropist, its fairytale about the humble migrant who gave back in spades to the city that adopted him from wartorn Europe, has just become a whole lot more complicated.</p> <p>It also potentially imbues The Gift with a sinister dimension, one that was, of course, near impossible to anticipate when Sredersas bequeathed it.</p> <p>\u201cIf he thought the gift would soothe his conscience, I hope it didn\u2019t work,\u201d Samaras says, as we sit by the Port Kembla harbour. \u201cI hope he was tormented by nightmares about the children murdered and buried in the forests of Lithuania.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nobody had reason to pay undue attention to Bronius \u201cBob\u201d Sredersas after he arrived in Wollongong in 1950, one among thousands of postwar European migrants who helped grow the Illawarra\u2019s Port Kembla steelworks into the biggest in the Commonwealth. Sredersas, 39 when he arrived in Australia aboard the Fairsea liner, initially lived for two years at Unanderra migrant hostel. He then bought a small block and built a house in what was Hoskins Street, Cringila \u2013 a humble Wollongong workers\u2019 suburb of unmade roads and fibros in the shadows of the steelworks\u2019 monolithic, ever-exhaling smoke stacks and blast furnaces. The quiet Lithuanian daily walked the couple of hundred metres to the steelworks where he toiled, initially as a labourer and later as a crane driver, until his retirement at 65 in 1975. Sredersas \u2013 \u201cMr Bob\u201d to Cringila locals \u2013 kept to himself. He avoided the rowdy, bustling pubs of Port Kembla, nightly jammed with post-shift steelworkers and wharfies for the six o\u2019clock swill. He steered clear of the horses, wasn\u2019t interested in football or cricket. A devout Catholic, he worshipped regularly, tended his cabbages, roses and lemons at the tiny cottage he shared with his cat, Mitzi. On weekends he\u2019d cycle down to Port Kembla harbour to fish and later share his catch with Mitzi. Neighbours and local kids were fond of him. A neighbour of 24 years once recounted: \u201cMy two girls loved him. All the local children played in his garden. His pockets were always full of sweets and when a child hurt itself while playing, it would run to Mr Bob for sympathy.\u201d Kind, gentle, avuncular, distinctive in his dark beret and often with pipe or cigarette in mouth, Bob Sredersas was the model citizen \u2013 and the ideal migrant success story. People about Cringila would occasionally observe him returning from the station carrying brown paper packages. Without a family to raise and having avoided drinking his earnings, on days off from the steelworks he would catch the old diesel train to Sydney where, from 1956, he attended fine art auctions. Using McCulloch\u2019s Encyclopedia of Australian Art as a guide, he amassed during the next two decades an extraordinary collection of Australian fine visual art, including paintings by Grace Cossington Smith, Arthur Streeton, Margaret Preston, William Ashton, Henry Buckmaster and Norman Lindsay. All available wall space in his cottage was adorned with his remarkable collection. He also owned many ivory pieces and Indigenous works from Papua New Guinea. But after a break-in and the theft of some works, and cognisant that he had nobody to leave the art to, from 1976 he made the benefaction that unavoidably thrust him into the limelight of local and national celebration: he gave the entire collection of some 100 works to the city of Wollongong. Sredersas has since been celebrated by the city and the Australian Lithuanian community, including with special guest lectures and dinners, with a gallery space in his name, a special plaque honouring his generosity, and with several exhibitions. He has been lauded in local and state media, his bequest shorthanded simply as \u201cThe Gift\u201d. Sredersas\u2019 philanthropy, upon which the city built a fine art collection and opened the Wollongong Art Gallery (one of regional Australia\u2019s finest) in 1978, earned him an almost mythical status as a cultural hero \u2013 the selfless migrant intent on repaying the community that harboured him from war-ravaged Europe. \u201cI have nobody but the people of Wollongong to leave them [the artworks] to. They are for the young people to learn, for old people to enjoy, and for me it\u2019s the realisation of a life\u2019s dedication,\u201d Sredersas said. \u201cIt was always my dream to see paintings in a gallery here. When I came to Wollongong there were many factories, buildings and bridges. People before me had built them. But I too can do something for future generations. You must not forget that we are only temporarily in this world but the human race will stay. Something must be done for future generations, future citizens.\u201d But four decades after his death, a more sinister picture of Sredersas\u2019 life is emerging, a life he concealed from those that knew him in Australia. In 2018, former Wollongong councillor Michael Samaras suspected something was not quite right with the Sredersas story and started digging. This summer he uncovered new archival evidence from Lithuania suggesting that during the second world war Sredersas served in the intelligence arm of the Nazi SS, which was instrumental in systematically slaughtering 212,000 Lithuanian Jews. If the evidence can be upheld, should Sredersas\u2019 name be stripped from the regional gallery that built itself on his gift? Should the plaque at the gallery be removed or amended to explain the institution\u2019s most prized collection was donated by an apparent Nazi collaborator and possible war criminal? Is it even possible to distinguish the collection from the man, who in his new life in Australia managed to mystify his war years? The City of Wollongong \u2013 and its exceptional art gallery \u2013 has much to contemplate. *** The Gift inevitably brought Bob Sredersas the type of attention he\u2019d always carefully evaded. His almost four decades in Europe \u2013 especially his war years \u2013 were at best enigmatic. \u201cBronius Sredersas chose not to talk about his youth, his experiences in the second world war and as a displaced person. He simply preferred to consider that his life began with his arrival in Australia,\u201d reads an essay in a 1989 Wollongong City Gallery (now Wollongong Art Gallery) exhibition catalogue about Sredersas. To mark its 40th anniversary in 2018 the gallery mounted an exhibition, The Gift \u2013 Remembering Bob Sredersas. Its catalogue essay tells of a man born to a privileged family in 1910 in Simferopol, on the Crimean peninsula, on 4 December 1910, who grew up in newly independent Lithuania and as a young man worked for the state police in criminal intelligence. The essay continues: \u201cHis service record abruptly ends at the time of the [first] Russian occupation \u2026 and Bob\u2019s story goes quiet during the second world war; his Australian immigration papers stating that he worked as a farm labourer and emphatically that he did not work as a policeman or soldier. Personal recollections of those who knew Bob in later years in Australia all agree on his reticence to talk about himself and his past, which only adds to the mystery and intrigue surrounding this time in his life.\u201d Mystery and intrigue now seem an understatement amid the emerging evidence about his wartime activities. In a place where perhaps half of the employees in the local industry \u2013 especially the steelworks \u2013 were \u201cnew Australians\u201d who had arrived soon after the war, and the understated Lithuanian always seemed to avoid answering a critical question while alive: what, precisely, did you do in the war, Bob? In death, he was close to beatified, his reputation for beneficence enhanced when he bequeathed his Cringila home to the local Catholic archdiocese \u201cfor assisting and educating underprivileged and destitute children\u201d. The Sredersas legacy for modest benevolence, for the virtue of hard work and humility, and for thanking a community that gave him a new life, was irresistible for the town built on steel and the sweat of migrants. \u201cBob Sredersas\u2019 story is probably the most gentle and beautiful of all the folklore that migrants have established in the steel town,\u201d reads an article in a 1985 special edition magazine celebrating the 100th anniversary of steelworks owner BHP. This folklore became central to Wollongong\u2019s view of itself. The thing about folklore, of course, is that its bedrock is often myth \u2013 story. And story often turns out to be quite different to truth and the raw materials of so much sound history: documentary evidence. Testimony to the enduring reverence for the old man is manifest in the Sredersas Gallery in the city\u2019s art gallery. Upstairs in the gallery (elegantly transformed from the city\u2019s former council chambers) a wall plaque celebrates \u201cThe Bob Sredersas Gift\u201d. Celebratory dinners were held in his name and occasional historical lectures delivered in his honour (including by Barry Jones and Donald Horne). The local studies section of the Wollongong Library also celebrates Sredersas. Its collection includes three curated boxes of his personal documentation (including birth certificates and migration papers) as well as his prosaic accoutrements \u2013 eye glasses and pipe, beret and crucifix. Wollongong attained something like peak Bob Sredersas with the 40th anniversary of the city\u2019s art gallery in 2018. There was a resurgence of media coverage about Sredersas\u2019s life and times, and a special exhibition to honour him. The gallery even elaborately recreated part of his home (replete with Australian masterpieces on the walls and with other brown paper-wrapped works stacked at floor level) in a tribute akin to the Tweed Regional Gallery\u2019s celebration of Margaret Olley\u2019s life and work. An evocative video was produced. It features an actor playing Sredersas speaking of his gift. \u201cI am Bob. Just Bob,\u201d the Sredersas character says. But now it seems that wasn\u2019t true. He was, apparently, much more. That is when 58-year-old Samaras, the son of a Greek immigrant father who worked as an industrial painter at the steelworks, and born and bred in Wollongong, started to become deeply suspicious. \u201cI decided to find out for myself exactly who he really was,\u201d Samaras says. *** From the time of The Gift, when Michael Samaras was about 12, he lived in a Wollongong reverent of Sredersas. \u201cI read the local paper, the Illawarra Mercury, every day as a kid. So, yes, I knew the story of Sredersas and The Gift intimately \u2013 it had been repeated and repeated and repeated. He became such an important figure in the local community and he still is,\u201d says Samaras, a former Labor member of Wollongong council and longtime supporter of the gallery, as we drive about his old town, where his father still lives. We stop outside Sredersas\u2019s old house, paint peeling off its window frames and rust eating the guttering. At the bottom of the street is one of the many gates into the steelworks, its monolithic chimneys belching smoke. Today it employs barely 2,000 people, compared with 22,000 in its heyday when Sredersas was there. We drive out of Sredersas\u2019s old street towards Port Kembla, past thoroughfares named in honour of other proud steel cities: Birmingham Street, Bethlehem Street, Newcastle Street. There is also a Steel Street. We drive through Port Kembla\u2019s heart along Wentworth Street, past those old workers\u2019 pubs that Sredersas avoided so he could buy art instead, past elegant cafes and shops selling clothes and antiques that signal a renaissance in this part of the Illawarra. Samaras says: \u201cThey\u2019ve been honouring his benefaction for decades. It\u2019s been in local media repeatedly \u2026 His story is part of Wollongong. It\u2019s central to the story of people coming here from Europe, postwar, building new lives, making a community, contributing. You know, all that hard work amid the smoke and pollution, investing his money in art and towards the end of his life leaving a legacy to the city. So, it\u2019s a lovely story and you can see why people have embraced it. It\u2019s the sort of story a city loves to tell itself. But it\u2019s a fairytale. There\u2019s a dark side that needs to be revealed and examined.\u201d We stop along the harbour, where fishers stand with their rods (as Sredersas once did) on the rocks with their backs to the steelworks: a melange of russet and sable and coal-black metallic horizontals and colliding verticals of conveyors, warehouses, cranes, smoke stacks and walkways. White fumes twist and bellow skywards. \u201cDuring all that publicity for the 40th anniversary of the gallery,\u201d Samaras says, \u201cthere was mention that Sredersas had been a police officer in Lithuania [before the German occupation]. And that\u2019s what made me think, \u2018Hang on \u2013 I know what the auxiliary police battalions got up to in Lithuania: they murdered the Jews. It was as if an alarm bell went off in my head.\u201d Samaras was especially struck by a local ABC article at the time. It included the thought-provoking lines: \u201cThe apparent double life of the Lithuanian migrant, who went from being an intelligence officer in his home country to a steelworker in New South Wales, remains shrouded in mystery 36 years after his death. \u201cMr Sredersas came from a middle-class family in the northern European country and went on to work as a policeman for the Lithuanian government\u2019s department of security, where he was tasked with monitoring Soviet military activity. His involvement with the civil service ended abruptly in 1940 when the Russians invaded Lithuania, prompting Mr Sredersas to flee, in fear for his life, to Germany.\u201d Samaras went through the archive at the Wollongong Library to confirm, via the translated Russian identity documents, Sredersas\u2019s personal details \u2013 including his christening name (Bronislav Schreders), date of birth (4 December 1910), place of birth (Simferopol, Crimea), and his parents\u2019 particulars. Samaras sent these details to the Lithuanian Special Archive in Vilnius together with \u201cBronius Sredersas\u201d, the (Lithuanian) name on his migration papers for entry to Australia in 1950. Samaras asked for any details about Schreders/Sredersas in Lithuania during the period 1940-44. The Lithuanian archive includes Russian KGB files. The KGB archives, most of which were collated after the Soviet Union reoccupied Lithuania from the Nazis in 1944, have detailed dossiers \u2013 based in part on records of interviews with Nazi collaborators and abandoned German records of those who served the Third Reich in implementing anti-Jewish (Holocaust) and anti-Russian policies. It is a long-accepted part of the Sredersas life story that he worked as a police officer in an intelligence unit before the first Soviet occupation. \u201cHis safety was at risk as a result of his employment by the Lithuanian security department in monitoring military activity prior to the invasion,\u201d according to the Wollongong City Gallery\u2019s 1989 exhibition catalogue. Sredersas emerges in all the publicity about his life post-The Gift as opaque about his war years. He was vague about whether he\u2019d fled to Germany along with many Lithuanian nationalists after the first Soviet occupation of Lithuania in August 1940, which ended with the Nazi invasion of June-July 1941 \u2013 or after the Soviet reoccupation of Lithuania in July 1944. (Having worked for Lithuanian intelligence, he would certainly have been a target.) According again to that exhibition catalogue, Sredersas was apparently \u201clabouring on the riverboats in Kaunas\u201d, Lithuania\u2019s temporary capital, in 1944. Regardless, after the war he was registered as a displaced person, migrated to Australia and lived an unassuming, modest life based on hard work and gratitude towards his adoptive country. A long-time associate of Sredersas reportedly said: \u201cHe was wanted at times by the Russians and the Germans, so it\u2019s pretty cloudy as to what his movements were in the war years.\u201d Cloudy indeed. Until, that is, officials at the Lithuanian archives responded to Samaras this summer. The records they produced \u2013 an application form, resume and related documents on SS stock \u2013 bear the name Bronislaw Shroeders rather than Bronislav Shreders, but the remaining details \u2013 date and place of birth and parents\u2019 names \u2013 match up with the birth records. \u201cThe documents show Sredersas was employed by the SD \u2013 Sicherheitsdienst \u2013 which was the intelligence agency of the [Nazi] SS [Schutzstaffel]. I also received a copy of his enlistment papers for the SS,\u201d Samaras says. During the German occupation of Lithuania from June 1941 to July 1944 the Nazis \u2013 abetted by Lithuanian authorities, including the state\u2019s police services and the SD \u2013 killed 96.4% (212,000) of the country\u2019s Jews, most in the latter part of 1941 but also until the Soviet reoccupation in 1944. The Lithuanian police auxiliaries were so effective at shooting Jews en masse that some were deployed to other countries including Ukraine and Belarus to carry out mass killing of Jewish people and to guard concentration camps. Initially Samaras used an online translation tool to interpret the Lithuanian archival documents that implicate Sredersas. To further verify them, he sent the documents to the Simon Wiesenthal Centre\u2019s Efraim Zuroff, the world\u2019s leading \u201cNazi hunter\u201d who has traced surviving and dead alleged second world war German war criminals to numerous countries, including Australia. Zuroff confirmed to Samaras that the documents show Sredersas worked for the SD and applied to join the SS. They don\u2019t indicate if the application was successful. Zuroff told the Guardian: \u201cIn 1943, he was working as a criminal investigator in Kovno [Kaunas] for the SD. By 7 November 1943, he had acquired German citizenship and applied to join the SS as a volunteer. In summation, he was an active participant in enforcing German directives and orders, and most likely was able to join the Waffen-SS, where he very likely participated in Holocaust crimes. \u201cThe fact that in 1943, he worked as a criminal investigator for the German Sicherheitsdienst in Kaunas means that he was involved in implementing German policy regarding the Jews, ie the Holocaust. The question is how long did he serve there? If, for example, he already served there in the second half of 1941, when most of the murders of Jews in Lithuania were carried out, then there is no doubt about his involvement in Holocaust crimes.\u201d Zuroff pointed out that the commander of the German SD in Lithuania was \u201cnone other than the mass murderer Karl J\u00e4ger, author of the infamous J\u00e4ger Report, which documented the mass murder of over 137,000 Lithuanian Jews from early July until the end of November 1941\u201d. \u201cAny person who served in the SD in Kaunas almost certainly was involved in the persecution and murder of Jews. If he served there during the period from July 1941 until the end of November 1941, there\u2019s no doubt whatsoever. But even if he only served in that unit later, it\u2019s a reasonable assumption that he was involved in mistreating the Jews,\u201d Zuroff says. \u201cAs far as serving in the Waffen-SS, that might have included mistreatment of \u2018enemies of the Reich\u2019 as well, but not necessarily. In any event those units were fighting for a victory of the Third Reich, the most genocidal regime in history.\u201d According to Sredersas\u2019 International Refugee Organization papers held at the National Archives of Australia, he was consistently in Lithuania until the Soviet reoccupation in 1944, though from August 1940 he insisted he was largely unemployed (with the exception of six months to June 1944, when he says he was a \u201cseaman\u201d). This is at odds with his apparent application to join the Waffen-SS as a volunteer in November 1943 when he listed his current place of work as \u201cSD\u201d \u2013 the intelligence organisation of the SS. *** In January Samaras alerted the Wollongong Art Gallery\u2019s director, John Monteleone, to the documents about Sredersas and Zuroff\u2019s interpretation of them. There is no suggestion that until the gallery \u2013 and then council \u2013 received these documents and Zuroff\u2019s assessment that they or anyone else knew of suggestions Sredersas was a member of the SD, had applied to join the SS or could have been involved in anti-Jewish Holocaust activities during the war. Samaras suggested the gallery consult an expert to examine the documents (possibly the Sydney Jewish Museum or Zuroff) and to reconsider its close association with the Sredersas name. \u201cAs you know I am a supporter of the Wollongong Art Gallery and understand that this information will come as a shock to many people,\u201d Samaras wrote to Monteleone. \u201cOnce you have had time to consider, I suggest we talk again to consider the best way to make this information public, and the next appropriate steps.\u201d The gallery director said he would consult the council, which operates the gallery. A week later a council bureaucrat wrote to Samaras: \u201cThank you for the information \u2013 I understand you are deeply concerned about the gallery\u2019s reputation. On balance, given the lack of clear evidence in this case, it is not deemed appropriate for council \u2013 as a local government body \u2013 to undertake such an investigative role as suggested. As such, council does not propose to take any further steps in this matter as this time.\u201d On Friday, a council spokesperson said it would not be appropriate for the council to comment on allegations made against a private individual: \u201cCouncil understands it would be the responsibility of the federal police to investigate such allegations.\u201d In relation to Sredersas\u2019 bequest it said that \u201cstandard industry processes were followed for the donation of these artworks. As a result, these artworks were accepted in good faith.\u201d Asked for comment, Monteleone did not personally respond, but the council spokesperson said the council\u2019s response also represented the position of the gallery. Samaras is not satisfied. \u201cI want them to address this properly. That is not going to happen overnight \u2013 I know that. They are a public institution and they need to go through a process \u2013 a journey. I think they should get a report written perhaps by the Simon Wiesenthal Centre or by the Sydney Jewish Museum that actually explains what happened in Lithuania and puts the documents in context so that the story is properly understood. \u201cThey can then engage the community, which knows the Sredersas legend, and say, \u2018Well, we honoured this man for 46 years but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to honour him any more.\u2019 They should change the name of the room from the Sredersas Gallery and take down the plaque that honours him. Then they have to tell the story of who he really was.\u201d Wollongong\u2019s beloved story about its modest philanthropist, its fairytale about the humble migrant who gave back in spades to the city that adopted him from wartorn Europe, has just become a whole lot more complicated. It also potentially imbues The Gift with a sinister dimension, one that was, of course, near impossible to anticipate when Sredersas bequeathed it. \u201cIf he thought the gift would soothe his conscience, I hope it didn\u2019t work,\u201d Samaras says, as we sit by the Port Kembla harbour. \u201cI hope he was tormented by nightmares about the children murdered and buried in the forests of Lithuania.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Fifty-one asylum seekers who were brought to Australia for medical treatment continue to languish in detention in Australia, including 18 in the Park hotel in Melbourne, with no indication of when they might be released, according to a prominent refugee support group. Their ongoing detention comes despite a string of recent releases, including high-profile campaigner and Iranian refugee Mehdi Ali, who was allowed to resettle in the US two weeks ago. Last week a group of nine men were allowed to leave the Park hotel, located in the inner Melbourne suburb of Carlton, and eight will now wait in the community while they organise to leave Australia. Their freedom has advocates questioning the seemingly \u201crandom\u201d way some of the refugees are allowed to leave, while others are left indefinitely detained. It is very hard to get accurate numbers on the number of people still detained under the medevac laws, but figures provided by the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre show about 206 people have been released \u2013 to other countries or allowed to live on bridging visas in the community. No one is sure why some are granted freedom and others still languish inside. Of the 51 people left in detention, most of them are men \u2013 there is only one woman. They come from a broad range of countries: Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Iran. Some came to Australia when they were teenagers and have now spent almost nine years locked up. All of them have been deemed by the government to pose no security threat. While the government won\u2019t ever provide the exact number of people stuck in detention, the ASRC director of advocacy and campaigns, Jana Favero, said since 2017 around 206 have been released and they have not been able to determine why. \u201cOf those, some have gone to the US, some are waiting to go to the US but the majority are in the community,\u201d Favero said. \u201cThere is no common thread between those who are in detention and those who are in the community. \u201cThe fact that the government have released 206 and left 51 in there shows it\u2019s a form of cruelty.\u201d They are not allowed to resettle permanently in Australia but other counties including the US, Canada and New Zealand have offered to take them, Favero said. \u201cWhile everyone who is still in detention is thrilled for their brothers when they get released, it compounds the situation that they\u2019ve been left behind,\u201d she said.

      "bodyText": "For almost four years, Suzanna Sheed has started each parliamentary sitting week by moving the same motion. The independent MP for Shepparton, a rural electorate of almost 50,000 people in northern Victoria, asks for a non-government business program to be reinstated in the state\u2019s lower house. Each week, leave to debate Sheed\u2019s motion is refused. But she always brings a speech with her in the hope that, one day, the government will let her speak on the matter. Non-government business refers to the time allocated to backbenchers, opposition members, minor parties and independents. It allows them to introduce their own bills, move motions, demand production of documents by the government and refer an issue for inquiry. Victoria\u2019s legislative assembly is the only lower house in Australia where this doesn\u2019t occur. \u201cIt\u2019s created a situation where the lower house is just this sort of odd place where the government dominates,\u201d Sheed tells Guardian Australia. \u201cOur opportunities to do anything significant are terribly limited and we don\u2019t get to hold them to account in the way that they do in the upper house.\u201d Changes to the standing orders made by the Bracks government between 1999 and 2004 effectively eliminated non-government business in Victoria. The leader of the house, Jacinta Allan, says there has been a range of measures introduced to increase the involvement of non-government MPs. \u201cWhether it\u2019s abolishing \u2018Dorothy Dixers\u2019, adding supplementary and constituency questions, or e-petitions, we\u2019ve put in a range of measures to ensure more voices in our parliament,\u201d Allan says. \u201cWe will continue to look at other ways we can increase this going forward.\u201d But Sheed says the only real opportunities she gets to speak out are under mechanisms shared between government and non-government members. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Sheed\u2019s electorate borders the Murray River. On the other side the river is the New South Wales independent MP for Murray, Helen Dalton. Since she entered parliament in 2019, Dalton \u2013 formerly of the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party \u2013 has campaigned strongly for the establishment of a public register listing all water owners in the state. She has introduced two private member\u2019s bills on the matter, and is planning a third. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have achieved as much as what I\u2019ve done if we weren\u2019t able to introduce private members\u2019 bills,\u201d Dalton says. \u201cThat\u2019s not saying it\u2019s easy. My first bill lapsed after six months because the government managed to stonewall or delay or filibuster until it lapsed. \u201cBut it started a conversation.\u201d Dalton describes the situation in Victoria as \u201cappalling\u201d. \u201cI really do feel for them because there\u2019s a lot of crossbenchers and independents \u2013 and we\u2019re going to continue to see more and more of us \u2013 so that has to change,\u201d she said. In Victoria\u2019s upper house, Reason party MP Fiona Patten has successfully lobbied the state government to introduce a supervised injecting room in Richmond, the enactment of the nation\u2019s first voluntary assisted dying laws and the decriminalisation of sex work. \u201cFiona Patten has been able to create so much change, not through her own bill passing but by raising awareness of an issue the government will often pick up,\u201d Sheed says. \u201cYet in our [lower] house, I represent an electorate of about 45,000 people who vote and there\u2019s a lot of issues that they would like for me to address. It just really disappoints me that we can\u2019t debate some of them.\u201d Non-government MPs in the lower house rarely get the opportunity to debate government bills either. Since 1993, the Legislative Assembly has set a government-business program for each sitting week. When the time falls for completion of the program, debate is interrupted and members are asked to vote on outstanding matters set out in the program. It\u2019s known as the \u201cguillotine\u201d. Ellen Sandell, the Greens MP for Melbourne, says the government has used this to avoid scrutiny on its bills. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly bad for our democracy and pretty poor form from a Labor government to shut down any debate, questions, scrutiny, transparency. It happens every single Thursday,\u201d Sandell says. \u201cThe crossbenchers and opposition often will ask, on specific bills, if we can just do the proper deep dive. And they always say no.\u201d Not one bill has gone to consideration in detail in this parliamentary term, meaning MPs have not been able to move amendments on a bill or debate its clauses in detail. Sheed says it is \u201cincredibly frustrating\u201d MPs were unable to put questions to the health minister, Martin Foley, during debate on the pandemic legislation last year. The opposition\u2019s spokesperson for government scrutiny, Louise Staley, agrees. \u201cAll the main ministers are in the lower house \u2013 the health minister, the treasurer, the transport infrastructure minister, the premier \u2013 and we\u2019re in a situation where we cannot put questions to them on legislation,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that we would do all the time, on each and every bill, but some are incredibly important. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue that goes to the very heart of democracy.\u201d The Centre for Public Integrity has released a discussion paper titled \u201cScrutiny shortcomings: Victoria\u201d, which raises concerns about the government businesses program and lack of non-government business in the lower house, along with the rules relating to the establishment of joint investigatory committees. \u201cThese deficiencies gravely impair the ability of the parliament to perform its constitutional role, and should be addressed as a matter of priority,\u201d it says. The thinktank said the weakness of Victoria\u2019s parliamentary scrutiny system was exposed by the Covid-19 response throughout 2020 and 2021, when the government failed to table health directions in parliament. The Labor-led Scrutiny of Acts and Regulations Committee found it had no power to review the directions as they weren\u2019t tabled in parliament. Both Sheed and Sandell have raised their concerns with the government but believe there is no appetite for change. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense in which I think neither party wants it because they like it when they\u2019re in government having this amount of power and not having to put up with all the \u2018nonsense\u2019,\u201d Sheed says. \u201cLook at the upper house \u2013 it\u2019s hard work for the government. But you know, we got a much better pandemic bill out of it, so that\u2019s democracy at work.\u201d Sandell says even those who support the Labor government should be worried. \u201cThese things have been eroded under a Labor government, but it could be a very rightwing government that comes in next, and they\u2019ll take advantage of all these things that have been eroded,\u201d she says. Opposition leader Matthew Guy says he would be happy to bring back non-government business if elected at the 26 November poll. \u201cEvery member of parliament, whether they\u2019re Liberal, Labor, National, independent or Green, they have a right to raise issues and have them debated for a period of time in the parliament. Because that\u2019s what the parliament exists for,\u201d he says.",

      "bodyText": "It was Sunday evening and Cheree Toka, then 26, was \u201cfreaking out\u201d. The next morning, Toka was due on the ABC Breakfast couch to explain to the nation why she was submerging the NSW government in hot water with her campaign to fly the Aboriginal flag permanently atop the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The idea was born in a car after a dinner out. \u201cI looked up as we were driving over the bridge and saw the Aboriginal flag wasn\u2019t there \u2013 just the NSW and Australian flags,\u201d Toka tells Guardian Australia five years later. \u201cI remember getting riled and saying to my friends \u2018this country is so messed up sometimes\u2019.\u201d So the young Kamilaroi woman started researching. She discovered the Aboriginal flag was flown atop the world-famous bridge just 19 days a year. \u201cThat didn\u2019t sit well with me, so I started a Change.org petition.\u201d That was in January 2017 and the campaign found traction almost immediately. Suddenly journalists wanted to know this young Aboriginal woman who was lighting up social media. National television, though, was a dizzying step up. \u201cI\u2019m almost reluctant to admit this, but I hadn\u2019t even voted at that point in my life,\u201d Toka recalls. \u201cI\u2019d just never delved into what the political parties stood for. I really had no idea! \u201cI was panicking, and very nervous. Public speaking had never been my thing.\u201d Anxious and overwhelmed, Toka reluctantly cancelled the ABC interview. \u201cIt was frustrating because I expected so much more from myself,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise then that people just wanted to hear my passion for this issue.\u201d Finding strength in adversity Toka\u2019s experience is a hallmark of our digital age, where everyday people can be empowered to start all manner of campaigns. Some even manage to go \u201cviral\u201d. But change rarely comes easily, and advocates can find themselves thrust into the spotlight before they\u2019re ready to handle it. If she was surprised by the campaign\u2019s initial popularity, she was even more surprised by the battle that was to come. \u201cI thought it was such an easy ask,\u201d she says. \u201cI had no idea it\u2019d take five years of relentless campaigning.\u201d Ironically, it was another media interview that steeled Toka for the fight ahead. It was February 2018 and she\u2019d just finished doing a photo call with the then NSW Labor leader Luke Foley, who had announced his party\u2019s support for her campaign. What should have been a day to celebrate quickly became anything but when Foley faced then 2GB radio host Alan Jones. The conservative firebrand excoriated Foley for pledging to fly the Aboriginal flag permanently atop the bridge. \u201cThat is the most divisive thing I\u2019ve heard from a political leader of any kind. I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019ve lost the electorate and you\u2019ve lost me,\u2019\u2019 Jones said. He wasn\u2019t finished there, telling Foley he had no hope of winning the state election the following year. \u201cThey will thrash you Luke, you\u2019re gone.\u201d What Jones couldn\u2019t know was that his opprobrium was a tipping point for Toka, providing the motivation to keep fighting. \u201cI didn\u2019t care what Alan Jones had to say,\u201d Toka says. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t support or represent me or my people. \u201cDespite the backlash, racism and setbacks, this man hadn\u2019t affected me, as earlier criticism had. That\u2019s when I knew \u2013 I will absolutely see this through.\u201d From that point on, when faced with self doubt, Toka listened to three things: \u201cMy gut, my heart, and my friends who said \u2018you have fire in your belly \u2013 now let it blaze!\u201d. Scaling a mountain, one step at a time Speak to Toka now and there\u2019s a sense she\u2019s become \u2013 not cynical but shrewd. \u201cI was naive,\u201d she says of her early years of campaigning. She heard many reasons why the flag couldn\u2019t be flown permanently: first it was flag protocol. Then it was needing to prove there was community support. Then it was the problem of erecting new poles. Then it was the cost of doing that. \u201cAt first I complied with everything they asked,\u201d Toka says. She amassed 177,000 signatures on her Change.org petition. She sought publicity by doing the BridgeClimb \u201ceven though I\u2019m terrified of heights\u201d. She collected 10,000 paper signatures, which compelled a NSW parliamentary debate. She faced her reluctance of speaking to media and politicians. She even started a GoFundMe to raise tens of thousands of dollars towards the quoted $300,000 cost of erecting new flagpoles. She now realises what was happening. \u201cExcuses,\u201d she says. \u201cThey just wanted me to shut up and go away. As I grew in confidence and sharpened my communication skills, that was never going to happen.\u201d On the weekend of 5 February, the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, promised to fly the flag permanently on the bridge within six months to a year. The announcement has left Toka feeling cautiously elated. She\u2019s keen to meet with Perrottet after his predecessor as premier, Gladys Berejiklian, consistently ignored her campaign. \u201cI\u2019d love to sit opposite Perrottet, hear him commit to a six-month deadline,\u201d she says. \u201cI also want to hear how it\u2019ll be done; it needs to be done respectfully and ceremoniously, and with Indigenous people at the heart.\u201d Making friends is the path to change Toka, now 31, admits she\u2019s matured a lot while pursuing her campaign. She\u2019s now savvy about making change, something she\u2019d love to do more of in the future, particularly with Indigenous education in schools. When asked what she\u2019s learned along the way, Toka says change doesn\u2019t happen overnight. \u201cYou have to have patience. And you have to make friends, even when you don\u2019t want to.\u201d The patience extends to her own political ambitions, having been invited to put her name forward for a spot on Labor\u2019s ticket at the Inner West council elections, which she politely declined. \u201cI\u2019m not ready yet,\u201d she says. \u201cGive it a few years.\u201d So how will she feel as that Aboriginal flag finally ascends the pole to take its permanent place atop one of Australia\u2019s most famous landmarks? \u201cI\u2019m going to feel like we did it. I helped make that happen. I\u2019m going to feel a sense of belonging and power,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll feel equal to non-Indigenous people.\u201d",

And this episode isn\u2019t really about Bluey and her dad Bandit making her little sister Bingo\u2019s birthday cake; it\u2019s about doing things that aren\u2019t fun because they have, in Bluey lingo, gotta be done.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/nov/20/from-sticky-gecko-to-sleepytime-how-well-do-you-know-bluey\">From Sticky Gecko to Sleepytime: how well do you know Bluey?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As Bluey learns the satisfaction that comes with completing tasks, parents will experience the horrified thrill of recognition over the bits of Lego strewn about the Heeler lounge room \u2013 a moment of valuable relatabilty in a house that\u2019s otherwise far nicer than most of us will ever see.</p> <p>It\u2019s also thoughtfully provided a generation of frustrated parents with a perfect ersatz swear when things get too difficult: \u201cOh, <em>duck cake!</em>\u201d Why not try it in front of your own children six or seven thousand times?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4932a0a457afa85c51228353101e4b6fdcfc95a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4932a0a457afa85c51228353101e4b6fdcfc95a1/0_3_1292_775/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from the Rain episode\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from the Rain episode of Bluey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ABC TV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>9. Rain</h2> <p>With barely any dialogue and some of the most gorgeous sound design and animation in the series so far, Rain has Bluey playing a very familiar game of trying to block a stream of water pouring down her front path. It\u2019s incredibly simple, but powerfully evocative: not only for how it captures those dark daytime storms familiar to anyone who\u2019s spent any time in Queensland, but also in the way that Bluey\u2019s mum Chilli gradually abandons her attempts to stay dry and embraces playing with her daughter. If you want a single episode that sums up the overarching philosophy of Bluey, it\u2019s hard to think of a better example.</p> <h2>8. Dance Mode</h2> <p>Some episodes of Bluey inspire fear in parents because they represent a new standard that children then expect in their own lives. Seriously, the tooth fairy rate mentioned in the episode Markets: <em>five </em><em>dollarbucks</em><em> per lost tooth?</em> Who even has physical paper money lying around the house these days?</p> <p>Anyway, Dance Mode goes one step further, by conditioning children to expect their parents to dance in public on demand \u2013 which both Chilli and Bandit do with gusto, if not exactly willing enthusiasm. In any case, this episode about how sometimes we say yes when we really want to say no involves a <em>lot</em> of public down-getting as it makes its way to its triumphant conclusion. It also contains a busker who <em>isn\u2019t</em> playing Leonard Cohen\u2019s Hallelujah, another refreshing break from reality.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9563bd456aa8472c6552df981bc1d121280aa7a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9563bd456aa8472c6552df981bc1d121280aa7a0/199_0_1432_859/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from the Camping episode\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from the Camping episode.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ABC TV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>7.

While the ending seems to wildly overestimate the enthusiasm of children who are not getting toys, it does involve Pat enraptured by an absolutely killer bit of 80s AOR rock, complete with bitchin\u2019 guitarmonies.

      "bodyText": "With 150 Bluey episodes now available on ABC iView for those in Australia and slightly fewer available on Disney+ for those in other, less Blueified countries, it can be hard to know where to start with this much-loved cartoon about a little blue heeler dog and her family \u2013 and then where to start again, and again, and again. Here are my 10 favourites: 10. Duck Cake It\u2019s never specified that the cake in question is being made from the Australian Women\u2019s Weekly Children\u2019s Birthday Cake Book \u2013 but let\u2019s be honest, it is. And this episode isn\u2019t really about Bluey and her dad Bandit making her little sister Bingo\u2019s birthday cake; it\u2019s about doing things that aren\u2019t fun because they have, in Bluey lingo, gotta be done. As Bluey learns the satisfaction that comes with completing tasks, parents will experience the horrified thrill of recognition over the bits of Lego strewn about the Heeler lounge room \u2013 a moment of valuable relatabilty in a house that\u2019s otherwise far nicer than most of us will ever see. It\u2019s also thoughtfully provided a generation of frustrated parents with a perfect ersatz swear when things get too difficult: \u201cOh, duck cake!\u201d Why not try it in front of your own children six or seven thousand times? 9. Rain With barely any dialogue and some of the most gorgeous sound design and animation in the series so far, Rain has Bluey playing a very familiar game of trying to block a stream of water pouring down her front path. It\u2019s incredibly simple, but powerfully evocative: not only for how it captures those dark daytime storms familiar to anyone who\u2019s spent any time in Queensland, but also in the way that Bluey\u2019s mum Chilli gradually abandons her attempts to stay dry and embraces playing with her daughter. If you want a single episode that sums up the overarching philosophy of Bluey, it\u2019s hard to think of a better example. 8. Dance Mode Some episodes of Bluey inspire fear in parents because they represent a new standard that children then expect in their own lives. Seriously, the tooth fairy rate mentioned in the episode Markets: five dollarbucks per lost tooth? Who even has physical paper money lying around the house these days? Anyway, Dance Mode goes one step further, by conditioning children to expect their parents to dance in public on demand \u2013 which both Chilli and Bandit do with gusto, if not exactly willing enthusiasm. In any case, this episode about how sometimes we say yes when we really want to say no involves a lot of public down-getting as it makes its way to its triumphant conclusion. It also contains a busker who isn\u2019t playing Leonard Cohen\u2019s Hallelujah, another refreshing break from reality. 7. Camping Bluey meets visiting French-speaking Jean-Luc while on a family camping trip and the language barrier doesn\u2019t stop them developing a firm friendship until he abruptly leaves without being able to tell her that he\u2019s leaving and no I\u2019m not crying, you\u2019re crying. It\u2019s a simple and beautiful lesson about embracing moments of joy as and when they arrive in our lives, even though \u2013 spoiler \u2013 teen Bluey and teen Jean-Luc meet again years later and he now speaks English and oh god why can\u2019t all loves be this perfect and pure? 6. Pass the Parcel This recent episode lit the socials up with the ire of a billion furious parents, who did not appreciate having their kids party traditions critiqued. The Heelers\u2019 next door neighbour Pat the Dog, AKA Lucky\u2019s dad, doesn\u2019t hold with this everyone-gets-a-prize business, calling for a game of pass the parcel that adheres to old school rules: one big prize in the middle, instead of one in every layer. Chaos, predictably, ensues; lessons are learned, parcels are passed, and Australia escapes becoming, as Pat puts it, \u201ca nation of squibs\u201d. While the ending seems to wildly overestimate the enthusiasm of children who are not getting toys, it does involve Pat enraptured by an absolutely killer bit of 80s AOR rock, complete with bitchin\u2019 guitarmonies. GUITARMONIES! 5. Stumpfest Chilli and Aunt Trixie (the always brilliant Myf Warhurst, whose \u201cGo and destroy the planet somewhere else!\u201d is the best line delivery of the episode and possibly any episode of anything) settle back with drinks, while Bandit, Uncle Stripe and Pat dig up stumps from the yard.

The Creek In another episode that captures an ultra-specific moment in Australian childhood, Bandit take the girls and their friend Mackenzie to the park, but when the kids get bored he decides that it\u2019s time to head down to the creek instead. Leeches, yabbies, dragonflies, tadpoles, and even a pademelon turns up as Bluey overcomes her aversion to the grubby, sticky outdoors and discovers that the bush is a beautiful place to be. As the kids learn the joys of spending time in nature, I heard echoes of my own father when Bandit warns the girls about dropbears: \u201cI\u2019m joking. But seriously, watch out for snakes.\u201d 3. Flatpack Chilli and Bandit build an Ikea-style outdoor swing-seat, while the girls play with the packaging and in doing so literally recreate the entire development of life. You know, the sort of thing that no other show would even think of doing. It\u2019s impossible to watch this episode and not see it as creator-writer Joe Brumm\u2019s spiritual-scientific manifesto: Bluey and Bingo start as mother and baby fish and then proceed through reptiles, dinosaurs, mammals and even cavedogs until finally an all-grown-up Bingo takes the now elderly Bluey to explore space. Extra points for the most meta line in the show, as Bandit scoffs at the Ikea-style illustrated instructions: \u201cI\u2019m not taking advice from a cartoon dog.\u201d Harsh, Bandit. 2. Baby Race AKA The One With Baby Bluey. Chilli remembers her first-time-parent anxieties as infant Bluey lags behind other kids in their mothers and babies group, with Chilli determined to get Bluey walking. From a condescending paediatrician dismissing Chilli\u2019s concerns, down to Bandit\u2019s mum deciding to put oil on Bluey\u2019s knees to force her to walk (Bandit: \u201cThis isn\u2019t legal any more!\u201d), this episode is both wise and hilarious. But the moment where an older, more experienced mother (voiced by Leigh Sales, no less) reassures Chilli with the one lesson she\u2019s learned from having \u201ceight \u2013 no, nine!\u201d kids is that all mums just need to hear that they\u2019re actually doing great, is another of the series\u2019 big waterworks moments. 1. Sleepytime In years to come, this Bluey episode will be used by humankind to test if someone is actually a replicant. If you\u2019re not struggling to suppress choking sobs by the time Bingo tells the Sun that she has to go now because she\u2019s a big girl, then we\u2019ll deploy the Blade Runners.

      "bodyText": "Teachers at Brisbane religious school Citipointe Christian College are being asked to sign employment contracts that warn they could be sacked for being openly homosexual. The school says the wording of staff employment conditions is \u201cunder review\u201d but one former teacher, who refused to sign the document last month, says he has now effectively lost his job for taking a stand. While religious bodies are allowed to discriminate in limited circumstances under Queensland law, critics have questioned the legality of the contracts. Citipointe\u2019s principal, pastor Brian Mulheran, stood aside last month after the school abandoned attempts to institute \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d enrolment contracts for students. The enrolment contracts asked families to sign a statement of faith that implied transgender students would only be recognised by their \u201cbiological sex\u201d, and which described homosexual acts as \u201cimmoral\u201d and \u201coffensive to God\u201d. The student contracts were ultimately withdrawn by the school after significant criticism and backlash. The school then apologised to students who felt \u201cthey would be discriminated against\u201d and said that the school needed \u201ctime to heal\u201d. \u201cI hope that by withdrawing the contract we can return all our focus to the Christian education of our students,\u201d Mulheran said at the time. Guardian Australia has now obtained a copy of the school\u2019s conditions of employment, which are part of each new teacher\u2019s workplace contract. The specific contract offer is dated in February \u2013 after the school\u2019s apologies and withdrawal of the student enrolment contracts \u2013 and is signed by the new acting principal, Ruth Gravestein. The document requires teachers to work within the same statement of faith of the International Network of Churches, the umbrella group that ultimately controls the Citipointe megachurch and school. \u201cIt is a genuine occupational requirement of the college that the employee not act in a way he knows, or ought reasonably to know, is contrary to the religious beliefs of the college,\u201d the document says. \u201cNothing in his/her deliberate conduct should be incompatible with the intrinsic character of their position, especially, but not only, in relation to the expression of human sexuality through heterosexual, monogamous relationships, expressed intimately through marriage. \u201cYour failure to abide by such requirements expressed in the above clauses could constitute a breach of your employment contract and subsequent dismissal.\u201d The use of the term \u201cgenuine occupational requirement\u201d in the employment conditions is an apparent attempt to mimic the wording of section 25 of the Queensland anti-discrimination act, which allows for religious bodies to discriminate in circumstances where a person \u201copenly acts in a way that the person knows or ought reasonably to know is contrary to the employer\u2019s religious beliefs\u201d. Lawyers say that, regardless, the \u201csexuality\u201d clause in the Citipointe contract is problematic. \u201cMy legal opinion is that this contract is likely to be found unlawful under Queensland anti-discrimination laws,\u201d said Matilda Alexander from the LGBTI legal service. \u201cIt seeks to prohibit conduct that is not in connection with the workplace by stopping an employee acting in a way that is contrary to the religious beliefs of the college, whether or not this is done openly. \u201cIt changes the \u2018don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u2019 mantra to \u2018don\u2019t do it\u2019. \u201cThis is far beyond the power of any employer in Queensland. We all have the right to attend work and pursue our own personal lives outside of work, even if working for a religious school.\u201d One former teacher, who refused to sign the contract, said Citipointe was an \u201cencouraging and supportive learning environment, with good facilities and hard-working staff\u201d. \u201cNot signing this contract was my choice, but I have effectively lost my job to discrimination,\u201d he said. \u201cExcluding LGBTQIA+ people from the school community perpetuates these archaic values, and doesn\u2019t prepare students for the real world. In the real world if you don\u2019t share values with a colleague or friend you can\u2019t contract them out of your life. \u201cI\u2019m disgusted by this kind of intolerance and discrimination hiding behind the name of God, especially when formalised in a contract. This is not Christianity.\u201d The Queensland attorney general, Shannon Fentiman, said Queensland\u2019s anti-discrimination laws were robust and urged anyone who believed they had been discriminated against in the workplace to make a complaint to the state Human Rights Commission. \u201cIt is absolutely appalling to see these awful and damaging clauses in the employment contracts for Citipointe College teachers \u2013 especially after the recent outrage and controversy around their student enrolment forms.\u201d The Independent Education Union\u2019s Queensland and Northern Territory branch, which represents teachers at Citipointe, said a \u201cstate of being\u201d was not sufficient basis for an employer to apply a \u201cgenuine occupational requirement\u201d exemption to anti-discrimination laws. The union has called for section 25 of the act to be repealed \u201cconsistent with changing societal norms and expectations\u201d. \u201c[The section of the act] is generally thought to have a disproportionate impact on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) workers, but the effect of the exemption is much more broad reaching,\u201d the union said in a statement. \u201cOur union has encountered examples where the exemption has a disproportionate effect on women, especially an unmarried pregnant woman, or a divorced person, or a person with a child to someone they are not married to. \u201cWhile these people are all lawful participants of society and are widely accepted as not infringing on community standards, section 25 of the act may be used to justify a decision to terminate that person\u2019s employment. \u201cThese exemptions are inherently unfair, out of step with modern community expectations and disproportionately affect the very sectors of society discrimination legislation is intended to protect.\u201d The school said in a brief statement the wording in employment contracts was \u201cunder review\u201d and that \u201cnew wording is awaiting approval\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "A toxic chemical released from tyres as they wear down on roads and implicated in mass deaths of salmon in the United States has been found in an Australian waterway for the first time. Scientists detected the compound \u2013 known as 6PPD-quinone \u2013 among a cocktail of chemicals and hundreds of kilograms of tyre particles washed into a creek from a motorway during storms. Researchers around the world are scrambling to understand the effect of the chemicals and particles from tyres after solving a mystery of years of mass deaths of coho salmon in Seattle. The commonly used tyre additive 6PPD \u2013 which transforms into 6PPD-quinone \u2013 was turning streams toxic for salmon. Earlier this month, scientists in Canada found the chemical was also toxic to two trout species, but at much higher concentrations. Scientists told Guardian Australia the latest finding should prompt urgent investigations to find out if Australian aquatic species are being harmed by 6PPD-quinone. University of Queensland scientists took water samples from the middle of Cubberla Creek beside Brisbane\u2019s M5 motorway after four storms in late 2020 and published their results in a journal. Levels of 6PPD-quinone in the creek, which feeds into the Brisbane River, peaked at concentrations comparable to those found to be killing Seattle\u2019s salmon. As much as 700kg of tiny tyre particles, up to 0.2mm wide and some much smaller, were estimated to wash off the roads and into the catchment after each storm. Lead author of the study, Dr Cassandra Rauert, an environmental chemist at the Queensland Alliance for Environmental Health Sciences at the University of Queensland, said they found elevated levels of the chemical for two days after storms. \u201cThe aquatic species living there are going to be exposed [to the chemical] over this period. The amount of tyre wear we found was also very surprising. \u201cWe have no idea of the effect of these particles or if fish are ingesting them. There are so many unknowns in this field. We should be worried, but we need to know more.\u201d Rauert and colleagues are planning to take samples at other sites throughout Queensland, including catchments flowing into the Great Barrier Reef. Dr Edward Kolodziej at the University of Washington in Seattle was part of the team that linked the deaths of coho salmon to the tyre additive. He told the Guardian 6PPD-quinone was \u201cone of the most toxic compounds known to exist for aquatic organisms\u201d. After reading the Australian findings, he said: \u201cFinding it at potentially lethal concentrations implies a substantial new and unmanaged risk for ecosystem health and sensitive aquatic organisms in these waters.\u201d He said more data collection was needed to show where and how tyre wear was entering sensitive habitats. Prof Frederic Leusch, who leads research on aquatic toxicology at the Australian Rivers Institute, based at Griffith University, said the concentrations of 6PPD-quinone found in Brisbane were \u201cnot insignificant\u201d and were likely representative of other areas around the country. Leusch, who was not involved in the study, said \u201cuntil we check and test we won\u2019t really know\u201d the effect on any Australian species but this work was now needed. He said the emergence of 6PPD-quinone illustrated a failure in how chemicals were developed for use in products. While 6PPD as an additive in tyres was well-known, there was no prior knowledge of how it could transform when in use. The tyre particles themselves could also be posing problems for fish. Leusch said: \u201cA small fish might have an intestine choc-a-bloc with these tyre particles and they can come with baggage of toxic chemicals. \u201cAll of these other chemicals I would wager we have no idea what they will do to fish or invertebrates in our rivers.\u201d Authorities in California are looking to regulate the additive, which is used to stop tyres degrading and cracking. Kolodziej said because tyres were used \u201cnearly everywhere people are present\u201d, there was \u201ca clear societal need to understand these products much better than we currently do\u201d. Tyre makers in the US say they have started several initiatives and research projects related to 6PPD-quinone in that country and globally. Silvio de Denaro, acting chairman of the Australian Tyre Industry Council, said tyre manufacturing had not taken place in Australia for a decade, but added: \u201cObviously it is important to seek an alternative to [6PPD] in manufacturing.\u201d Many councils used either capture ponds or other methods for road run-off and these could catch some chemicals, he said.",

      "bodyText": "One of the UK\u2019s biggest manufacturers of asbestos and the industry bodies that it co-founded historically withheld information on risks posed by the carcinogenic material, playing down the dangers while lobbying the government for product warnings to be tempered, according to documents released after a lengthy court battle. A lawyer who acted for the Asbestos Victims Support Groups Forum UK in its fight to obtain the documents about Cape compared its behaviour to the tobacco industry\u2019s former refusal to admit evidence of harms from smoking while its own research showed the opposite. Despite all types of asbestos being banned in the UK since 1999, it still kills thousands of people every year. According to the court documents, a partner company of Cape\u2019s was considering a warning label on asbestos products in 1958, but Cape advised it that \u201ca caution label on our products and none on [our competitors] would make our selling efforts most difficult\u201d. They also state that in 1969, Cape\u2019s group medical adviser accepted in a document that the fatal cancer mesothelioma could be caused by \u201cshort and possibly small\u201d exposure and that \u201cno type of asbestos proved innocent\u201d.

Additionally, from 1966, the ARC successfully lobbied the government for regulation of asbestos products to be on a \u201cmaximum allowable concentration\u201d basis rather than the \u201cno dust policy\u201d that had been proposed. The forum says the documents also show Cape\u2019s in-house sampling data threw up significantly higher dust counts than industry standards for accepted levels of exposure, but data unfavourable to Cape was withheld. At the same time, the company provided reassurances about asbestos. A 1976 booklet by the Asbestos Information Committee, of which Cape was also a founding member, said: \u201cThe normal use of asbestos products should not be a cause for anxiety.\u201d In light of the information in the documents, the forum is demanding that Cape apologise and make a \u00a310m donation towards mesothelioma research. The forum\u2019s chair, Joanne Gordon, said: \u201cWe believe victims and their families deserve this by way of an apology from Cape for their deliberate deception and shamelessly causing deaths, adding insult by vehemently defending cases.\u201d The documents originate from litigation brought against Cape on behalf of insurers by who had settled employers\u2019 liability claims resulting from workers\u2019 exposure to asbestos and who wanted to recoup some of their outlay. The case was settled before judgment, but Graham Dring, then chair of the forum, successfully fought a three-year battle for the forum to access the court documents. Cape resisted disclosure, taking the case to the supreme court, but Dring succeeded in setting a legal precedent allowing written material placed before a court to be seen by a non-party.

      "body": "<p>Crisis? What crisis? Into the top half of the Premier League and the quarter-finals of European competition, important players coming back from injury to enable rotation, Leicester City set up a winning platform thanks to a couple of memorable early goals from Timothy Castagne and James Maddison that enabled them to withstand a Brentford rally that ended with Yoane Wissa\u2019s late strike. Leicester even came up with a ploy to counter their opponents\u2019 set\u2011piece threat, so no wonder Brendan Rodgers was smiling in the spring sunshine at the final whistle.</p> <p>Brentford seemed to lack belief in the first half as they attempted to cope without Christian Eriksen, their creative catalyst in the successive victories over Norwich and Burnley that earned them an eight-point buffer from the relegation zone. The Denmark player was missing through Covid-19 but it is thought he will join up with his compatriots, for games against Serbia and the Netherlands.</p> <p>\u201cOf course he\u2019s a top player and I\u2019d have liked him out on the pitch,\u201d Thomas Frank, the Brentford manager, said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think even he could have stopped the two goals going into the top corner.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/mar/20/tottenham-hotspur-v-west-ham-united-premier-league-live\">Tottenham Hotspur v West Ham United: Premier League \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Leicester\u2019s goals came from almost exactly the same spot but from vastly contrasting sources.

      "bodyText": "Crisis? What crisis? Into the top half of the Premier League and the quarter-finals of European competition, important players coming back from injury to enable rotation, Leicester City set up a winning platform thanks to a couple of memorable early goals from Timothy Castagne and James Maddison that enabled them to withstand a Brentford rally that ended with Yoane Wissa\u2019s late strike. Leicester even came up with a ploy to counter their opponents\u2019 set\u2011piece threat, so no wonder Brendan Rodgers was smiling in the spring sunshine at the final whistle. Brentford seemed to lack belief in the first half as they attempted to cope without Christian Eriksen, their creative catalyst in the successive victories over Norwich and Burnley that earned them an eight-point buffer from the relegation zone. The Denmark player was missing through Covid-19 but it is thought he will join up with his compatriots, for games against Serbia and the Netherlands. \u201cOf course he\u2019s a top player and I\u2019d have liked him out on the pitch,\u201d Thomas Frank, the Brentford manager, said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think even he could have stopped the two goals going into the top corner.\u201d Leicester\u2019s goals came from almost exactly the same spot but from vastly contrasting sources. Castagne produced such a brilliant right\u2011foot shot from just outside the left corner of the penalty area, after receiving Harvey Barnes\u2019s short pass, for only his third goal since joining from Atalanta in September 2020, that he ran away reaching his hands to his head, as if in disbelief. On his first start of the year, this was some way to mark his return after a thigh injury. \u201cI think that surprised everyone,\u201d Rodgers quipped, \u201ceven himself.\u201d That shot swerved powerfully into the far top corner in the 20th minute, and 13 minutes later David Raya, the Brentford goalkeeper, was picking the ball out of the other corner. Maddison picked himself up, having been fouled by Mathias Jensen, and bent his shot into the near top corner, for his 13th goal of the season in all competitions. \u201cYou virtually expect James to score from that position, and that says everything,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cHe has tremendous quality in that position.\u201d Both goalscorers were fresh selections as Rodgers was able to make four changes to the team that returned triumphant from Rennes after reaching the last eight of the Europa Conference League where they face PSV Eindhoven next month. In this match, set pieces had always looked likely to be an intriguing, potentially decisive factor, albeit more for the hosts. No team has had more trouble in defending them than Leicester, who have conceded a divisional-high 20 goals from restarts, while Brentford had scored 50% of their 32 Premier League goals from this source. So when the visiting team had their first corner midway through the first half, three Leicester forwards promptly ran up to the halfway line, leaving Thomas Frank with a dilemma: to stick, with two defenders back, or twist, and bring sufficient cover back.

      "bodyText": "Ministers have serious questions to answer on the growing scandal at P&amp;O Ferries and must make it a catalyst to improve workers\u2019 rights, the Trades Union Congress said on Sunday. The TUC accused the government of sitting on its hands and failing to protect workers after P&amp;O sacked 800 staff on Thursday with a plan to replace them with cheaper agency workers. It has emerged that ministers were informed in advance about the mass redundancies. The TUC\u2019s general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, demanded the government \u201curgently bring forward an employment bill to stop workers from being treated like disposable labour \u2013 and make sure what happened at P&amp;O never happens again\u201d. She accused ministers of failing to challenge P&amp;O on what she called \u201cunconscionable tactics \u2013 or even question whether these actions were legal\u201d. O\u2019Grady called on the company to immediately reinstate all sacked staff, without any loss of pay. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, criticised the treatment of workers by the ferry company. \u201cWhat we are seeing is appalling, the way that they have treated their workers, it is awful, it is wrong,\u201d Sunak told the BBC. He added that ministers were examining the company\u2019s actions and whether they complied with regulations on dismissing workers. Employment lawyers reacted with surprise to the company\u2019s move to sack 800 seafarers out of the blue, and said that P&amp;O Ferries may have broken several laws, potentially leaving it open to claims of unfair dismissal. Over the weekend, angry protests were held at ports across the UK. Trade union leaders and politicians joined sacked P&amp;O Ferries workers in Dover, Hull, Liverpool and Larne amid growing rage over the company\u2019s decision, with more protests planned for the coming days, including outside parliament on Monday. On Sunday, P&amp;O warned customers that its services would be \u201cunable to run for the next few days\u201d. The company said it was \u201cadvising travellers of alternative arrangements\u201d for its cross-Channel and Irish Sea routes. P&amp;O Ferries has been accused of looking to exploit a loophole in minimum wage laws, in order to bring in cheap workers to crew its vessels. The firm has previously been accused of hiring workers for as little as \u00a31.83 an hour. Union officials have said P&amp;O may be able to cut its wage bill by up to half by using agency workers instead of existing staff. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) said it had discovered that new crew on ships on the Liverpool-Dublin route will be paid at rates well below the minimum wage. The RMT general secretary, Mick Lynch, said there was no effective way to stop the company from paying workers less than the minimum wage and called for new employment legislation to protect seafarers. \u201cWe fear poverty pay will be accompanied by seafarers being chained to 12-hour day, seven-day week contracts that operate continuously for six months, with no pension,\u201d he said. The RMT has called for a boycott of P&amp;O services. Concerns have also been growing over a \u00a3146m deficit in the seafarers\u2019 industry pension scheme, which is owed by P&amp;O Ferries and its parent company DP World. It is thought the taxpayer could be liable for the shortfall in the Merchant Navy Ratings pension fund, which includes retired P&amp;O crew, if it was left unpaid. DP World, one of the world\u2019s largest port operators, is owned by Dubai\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. It bought P&amp;O Ferries for the second time in 2019, for $322m (\u00a3244m), having sold it earlier in the decade. Losses at the business are thought to have escalated in recent months, after disruption to travel during the Covid-19 pandemic, combined with increased post-Brexit paperwork for cross-Channel services, and the rising cost of diesel. DP World also owns the London Gateway port, which was opened as the first of the controversial freeports championed by Sunak, and established by the government last year. Sunak said on Sunday the government was examining all of its commercial relationships with P&amp;O Ferries. A spokesperson for P&amp;O Ferries said it had taken the decision to make 800 staff redundant \u201cas a last resort and only after full consideration of all other options\u201d, after it made a \u00a3100m loss. \u201cUltimately, we concluded that the business wouldn\u2019t survive without fundamentally changed crewing arrangements, which in turn would inevitably result in redundancies,\u201d they said.",

Russia has said it has twice deployed its newest Kinzhal (Dagger) hypersonic missile in Ukraine, claiming on Sunday to have destroyed a fuel depot near Mykolaiv and on Saturday an underground missile and ammunition storage site in the west. The state news agency RIA Novosti has said the attacks represented the first use of the next-generation weapon since the start of the war in Ukraine and western analysts said they were the first time hypersonic missiles had been used in combat. Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, has described the Kinzhal, designed to be launched from a MiG fighter jet, as \u201can ideal weapon\u201d. It can fly at up to 10 times the speed of sound and \u2013 like a slower cruise missile \u2013 can manoeuvre in mid-flight, making it harder for air-defence systems to track and intercept. The missiles can be used to deliver conventional warheads at higher speeds and more accurately than others, but could also be used to deliver nuclear weapons. Several countries are working on the technology, including China and the US. Why is Russia using them? Vasily Kashin, a Russian analyst, told Agence France-Presse the greater penetration and destructive power of the Kinzhal system would be more efficient than subsonic missiles at destroying underground storage sites, but other experts have suggested it would not have a major impact on the course of the conflict. Pavel Felgenhauer, another Russian analyst, said the missile would change little on the ground in Ukraine beyond \u201cgiving a certain psychological and propaganda effect\u201d, adding that its use may suggest Russian forces were running out of other weapons.

      "bodyText": "Forest experts and scientists are asking Nasa to extend the life of a \u201ckey\u201d climate and biodiversity sensor due to be destroyed in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere early next year. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (Gedi) mission \u2013 pronounced like Jedi in Star Wars \u2013 was launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to the International Space Station (ISS) in December 2018, and has provided the first 3D map of the world\u2019s forests. Data from the Nasa mission, which has used billions of laser beam signals to measure the height, shape and health of the Earth\u2019s trees since April 2019, has been helping scientists answer questions about land-use change, a key driver of the climate crisis and biodiversity loss, including how much carbon trees store and the effect of forest fires on the atmosphere. The $150m project is scheduled to be \u201cde-orbited\u201d from the ISS early next year and the sensor \u2013 roughly the size of a fridge \u2013 will be incinerated in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Researchers overseeing the project, based at the University of Maryland, have asked for an extension to allow Gedi to finish its work and calibrate the results with other satellites due to launch this decade that will monitor the planet\u2019s ecosystems. Early results from the project indicate there could be much more carbon stored on land than previously thought. While they acknowledge Gedi\u2019s lifetime has already been extended once, in March 2021, the researchers say extensions on the ISS are common and the tool is providing crucial data, including helping to monitor the Cop26 commitment from 142 countries to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030. \u201cThe biggest uncertainty we have in terms of atmospheric CO2 concentrations driving climate change is the balance between deforestation and subsequent regrowth. Gedi is helping us address that,\u201d said Prof Ralph Dubayah, principal investigator on the mission. \u201cIf you want to plant a trillion trees, go ahead. But you have to know what you\u2019re starting with to know what kind of impact that\u2019s going to have.\u201d Leading forest experts have backed calls for a stay of execution. They called the sensor a \u201ckey tool\u201d for understanding global heating and described its pending destruction as a waste of money. When contacted by the Guardian, Nasa said Gedi has already been extended beyond its prime mission to allow for additional data collection and is scheduled to be replaced by another sensor early next year. Although scientists know the planet\u2019s trees are an enormous carbon store holding the equivalent of nearly a century\u2019s worth of annual fossil fuel emissions at the current rate, basic questions about the size and structure of forests remain unanswered. The uncertainty poses difficulties for researchers tracking emissions from land-use change. \u201cConsidering that we have to accelerate climate action, and forests are something we can use for mitigation, it is critical that Gedi meets its scientific goals,\u201d said Laura Duncanson, a research scientist on the Gedi team. Inge Jonckheere, an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) author and head of remote sensing and climate change at the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization, said: \u201cEvery country can come up with its own definition of a forest. Countries can just fill in numbers and then everybody has to take them as the truth. But with satellites, we can check them,\u201d said Jonckheere. Fred Stolle, deputy director of the forest programme at the World Resource Institute, said his organisation was adding Gedi data to its Global Forest Watch platform, one of the primary free sources of reliable information about the world\u2019s forests. \u201cCurrently, our main tool is tree cover from the Landsat programme. But now we are shifting to tree height because it is a better indicator of forest health using Gedi,\u201d he said. \u201cThe data allows us to find important areas of forest and say: do not touch this.\u201d Diego Saez Gil, head of Pachama, a carbon offsetting firm that uses AI and remote sensing to verify and monitor carbon capture by forests, said Gedi provided \u201cthe best available data to estimate the carbon stored in forests\u201d. \u201cThe longer Gedi stays in orbit, the more spatial coverage we can get, improving the quality of biomass estimates. If Gedi were to remain in orbit, we could have long-term continuous records of biomass.\u201d Matthew Hansen, a remote sensing scientist whose data is used as the scientific standard in deforestation research, said the combination of GEDI and other Nasa land monitoring enabled researchers to \u201cassess deforestation and associated emissions, as well as restoration efforts\u201d.

After that we managed the game fantastically well,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>This was the first time Vieira had started his entire hand of attacking players \u2013 Patrick\u2019s Pups, age range: 21 to 29 \u2013 in the same game. With Eberechi Eze handed a start after a season disrupted by a cruel achilles injury, a front five of Eze, Conor Gallagher, Michael Olise, Wilfried Zaha and Jean-Philippe Mateta sished up a mouthwatering blend of energy and movement.</p> \n<p>A team that survived in the top tier by smothering and keeping the centre solid has the weapons to play an entirely different game now.</p> \n<p>The third Palace goal on 78 minutes seemed to sum up that fluency, finished off by Zaha after Olise\u2019s shanked shot had hit the post: both men all alone in the Selhurst sunshine as the white Everton shirts stood and watched, and greeted by another barrelling cheer from a basking home crowd.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f807e005-7aa7-4cb9-82c2-139c5c2ec2f2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Manchester City v Liverpool<br></p>\n    <p>Chelsea v Crystal Palace</p>\n    <p>The ties to be played at Wembley on 16/17 April.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The contrast will have been stark for Everton supporters, on a day where their team began with intent but congealed once the day turned against them. Here was an opposition with a clear set of attacking patterns, and with players who seemed utterly delighted to be out there discovering their own deeper gears. So this is what team building looks like.</p> \n<p>Selhurst Park had been a breezy, chilly place at kick off, the air thick with flare-smoke, the supersized Cup quarter-final away end already on its feet.</p> \n<p>Frank Lampard had re-installed Jordan Pickford after illness and brought in Andr\u00e9 Gomes, Jonjoe Kenny and Andros Townsend. And Everton did dominate the possession early on.</p> \n<p>With a minute gone Michael Keane found himself alone in front of goal but snatched his shot wide. Richarlison, who chose to play here rather than return home after the death of his grandfather, ballooned the ball over the bar from a decent position. For a while Anthony Gordon did Anthony Gordon things, sniping into space and passing accurately, a footballer with a precious kind of optimism about his game.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7627862a54d5fc74c0a1d0ffd51f0cfd2012468\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7627862a54d5fc74c0a1d0ffd51f0cfd2012468/0_4_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wilfried Zaha scores Crystal Palace\u2019s third goal past a prone Jordan Pickford\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wilfried Zaha scores Crystal Palace\u2019s third goal past a prone Jordan Pickford.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>With 17 minutes gone Townsend left the field with what Lampard confirmed later looked like a serious knee injury. At which point, the game turned completely. First Eze mustered up a shot on the turn after some neat interplay with Olise. Then on 25 minutes Olise produced a lovely, shark-like burst down the right to win a corner. His first kick, viciously whipped in, was palmed over by Pickford. The second, on the same angle but better placed, was flicked into the net by the head of Marc Gu\u00e9hi.</p> \n<p>This was a finish of real skill, not just reading the line of the ball but directing it through a crowd of players. But Everton clearly have a problem with conceding from set pieces. These are basic coaching elements.</p> \n<p>For a while Everton were limited to off the cuff breakaway attacks, Gomes and Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 unable to find any rhythm in midfield.</p> \n<p>And on 41 minutes it was 2-0. Eze carried the ball forward on the left then nudged the perfect pass on to Zaha. His low cross found Mateta. The finish was low and hard past Pickford, who flopped to the ground but couldn\u2019t get a hand on the ball.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/mar/20/southampton-v-manchester-city-fa-cup-quarter-final-live\">Southampton v Manchester City: FA Cup quarter-final \u2013 live!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>By now Everton looked baffled, frozen, bemused by the apparently unforeseen possibility of going a goal behind, of finding opponents with ideas and energy of their own.</p> \n<p>Lampard sent on Dominic Calvert-Lewin for the second half, Demarai Gray having already replaced Townsend in a new-look front three.

      "bodyText": "On a lovely, soft, spring-like south London afternoon Crystal Palace produced a performance of thrust and refined attacking interplay to surge into an FA Cup semi-final at Wembley, and set up an intriguingly upbeat denouement to their season. It helped that Palace were pitched against an Everton team that seemed to have no clear idea how they wanted to play, and none of the rage and resilience required to respond once they fell behind. Palace scored twice in each half. By the end the 4-0 defeat looked a little generous. Afterwards Patrick Vieira could barely stop smiling, delighted by his team\u2019s collective effort. \u201cWe went though a difficult 20 minutes and we stuck together and we accepted the fact they were on the top of us, so we decided to wait until we were back into the game. After that we managed the game fantastically well,\u201d he said. This was the first time Vieira had started his entire hand of attacking players \u2013 Patrick\u2019s Pups, age range: 21 to 29 \u2013 in the same game. With Eberechi Eze handed a start after a season disrupted by a cruel achilles injury, a front five of Eze, Conor Gallagher, Michael Olise, Wilfried Zaha and Jean-Philippe Mateta sished up a mouthwatering blend of energy and movement. A team that survived in the top tier by smothering and keeping the centre solid has the weapons to play an entirely different game now. The third Palace goal on 78 minutes seemed to sum up that fluency, finished off by Zaha after Olise\u2019s shanked shot had hit the post: both men all alone in the Selhurst sunshine as the white Everton shirts stood and watched, and greeted by another barrelling cheer from a basking home crowd. The contrast will have been stark for Everton supporters, on a day where their team began with intent but congealed once the day turned against them. Here was an opposition with a clear set of attacking patterns, and with players who seemed utterly delighted to be out there discovering their own deeper gears. So this is what team building looks like. Selhurst Park had been a breezy, chilly place at kick off, the air thick with flare-smoke, the supersized Cup quarter-final away end already on its feet. Frank Lampard had re-installed Jordan Pickford after illness and brought in Andr\u00e9 Gomes, Jonjoe Kenny and Andros Townsend. And Everton did dominate the possession early on. With a minute gone Michael Keane found himself alone in front of goal but snatched his shot wide. Richarlison, who chose to play here rather than return home after the death of his grandfather, ballooned the ball over the bar from a decent position. For a while Anthony Gordon did Anthony Gordon things, sniping into space and passing accurately, a footballer with a precious kind of optimism about his game. With 17 minutes gone Townsend left the field with what Lampard confirmed later looked like a serious knee injury. At which point, the game turned completely. First Eze mustered up a shot on the turn after some neat interplay with Olise. Then on 25 minutes Olise produced a lovely, shark-like burst down the right to win a corner. His first kick, viciously whipped in, was palmed over by Pickford. The second, on the same angle but better placed, was flicked into the net by the head of Marc Gu\u00e9hi. This was a finish of real skill, not just reading the line of the ball but directing it through a crowd of players. But Everton clearly have a problem with conceding from set pieces. These are basic coaching elements. For a while Everton were limited to off the cuff breakaway attacks, Gomes and Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 unable to find any rhythm in midfield. And on 41 minutes it was 2-0. Eze carried the ball forward on the left then nudged the perfect pass on to Zaha. His low cross found Mateta. The finish was low and hard past Pickford, who flopped to the ground but couldn\u2019t get a hand on the ball. By now Everton looked baffled, frozen, bemused by the apparently unforeseen possibility of going a goal behind, of finding opponents with ideas and energy of their own. Lampard sent on Dominic Calvert-Lewin for the second half, Demarai Gray having already replaced Townsend in a new-look front three. But part of the beauty of Palace\u2019s high-craft front six is the ability of those players to manoeuvre the ball, to retain possession by being smarter and quicker in their footwork and their passing. Olise continued to glide infield from the right, eventually drawing a booking for desperate-looking Mason Holgate, who really couldn\u2019t cope with his movement. Gallagher pressed like a dervish. Zaha, who must be having the time of his life right now, looking back at those years when he was The Only Guy, was a source of high-grade menace down the left. With three minutes to play Will Hughes added a fourth as Palace besieged the Everton goal with an easy, almost sadistic sense of pleasure, smashing the ball past Pickford after Gallagher\u2019s shot had been saved. \u201cThey will all want to play Palace. If Chelsea, City and Liverpool go through we will be the underdogs,\u201d Vieira said afterwards, looking absolutely delighted at the prospect.",

And what has only been done by Manchester City in 1926, Leicester City in 1969, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion in 1983, Middlesbrough in 1997 and Portsmouth in 2010?...</p> <p>...</p> <p>...Wigan are the only team to have won the FA Cup and been relegated in the same season, while the others were losing finalists who were relegated. I daresay a significant majority of<strike> Everton fans </strike> Evertonians, without a trophy since 1995, would take the former just as alacritously as so many Wiganers did, and why not? A day to remember forever, immortalised in the annals of humanity, rather than another season of nondescript nothingness in a league that has passed them by. The suits might feel differently, but that\u2019s just another part of what makes it all so appealing. </p> <p>Perhaps, though, Thursday night\u2019s gloriously absurd win over Palace represents a momentum shift: Everton stay up easily and win the Cup too, the football world flabbergasted by the full flowering of Frank\u2019s managerial genius. Perhaps. </p> <p>Palace, meanwhile, have their own tale of woe they\u2019d like to assuage, reaching two finals, in 1990 and 2016, only to be beaten in both by poor Manchester United sides \u2013 to say nothing of Alan Pardew\u2019s dancing. OK, to say something of it, for it remains extremely amusing. But they\u2019re an entirely different proposition these days, a young, dynamic and enterprising outfit with the firepower to trouble anyone, who just this week were solid enough to restrict Man City to nil. This is a chance for then they know it. </p> <p>Or, put another way, what should be a terrific cup-tie awaits us. Here we go, here we go, here we go! </p> <p><strong>Kick-off: 12.30pm GMT</strong></p> </div>   </div>",

Otherwise, here\u2019s what we\u2019ve got going on right now, with Spurs v West Ham to come. Not bad eh? Ta-ra! Palace are going to Wembley! They join Chelsea in the last four, and look a serious threat, solid at the back and with the confidence and creativity to beat anyone. Everton, not so much. 90 min There\u2019ll be two added minutes. Seems a long time since Everton were dominating the opening 20, but that\u2019s how it goes when you\u2019re struggling: you can start well, but as soon as things go against you, you collapse. 90 min Ally McCoist gives Gallagher man of the match. I\u2019d\u2019ve gone for Olise, but can\u2019t quibble too much. 88 min Yup, it\u2019s a goal! Everton did not need this, at all, but Palace are really, really good. 88 min There\u2019s a check for handball against Gallagher, but I\u2019m sure the goal is fine; he didn\u2019t control with an arm. It\u2019s a kicking! Edouard drives towards the box and cracks a pass into Gallagher, to spins on it adroitly, using the pace of it and his turn to lash a low shot that Pickford shoves out ... but only as far as Hughes, pushing on, and he finishes high into the net! 86 min Gallagher sticks the free-kick into the box and Godfrey heads behind. 85 min Edouard finds Benteke, then Zaha tries some trickery down the right and Gordon\u2019s had enough, tripping him then, when that doesn\u2019t stop him, pulling him down. 83 min Two changes for Palace, Hughes and Benteke replacing Kouyate and Olise, who\u2019s been the best player on the pitch \u2013 and by far. 83 min Ah, Everton. Again, Calvert-Lewin holds up well, Gray breaking ono the ball that\u2019s teed-up for him, only to pass a tame effort that Butland saves easily enough. 81 min Tell you what, no one left in this competition will fancy meeting Palace next. They are buzzing, and rightly so. Palace are going to Wembley! Zaha does really well down the left, weaving and fighting through two challenges, looking for feed Edouard but overhitting his square pass so that it reaches Oliseh, wider inside the box; he shoots, against his own leg I think, and the ball loops up, flies into the far post, cracks it in the face, and drops perfectly for Zaha to sidefoot home! This is over! 78 min But have a look! Zaha tricks inside Godfrey, tying his feet up; Godfrey collapses, Zaha takes another touch, should shoot ... takes another touch ... and Holgate makes a decent challenge. 77 min Everton are coming! Richarlison finds Gordon, who knocks off a perfectly-weighted ball into the path of the overlapping Gray ... but his cross is collected by a sprawling Pickford. 76 min Better again from Everton, the ball moving through Docure, Richarlison and Calvert-Lewin, but Iwobi\u2019s eventuating cross is behind the latter and Kenny\u2019s subsequent effort goes results in a goalkick. 74 min Iwobi replaces Coleman, and I\u2019m a little surprised at that: though Iwobi is an attacker who scored a key winner in midweek, Coleman\u2019s crosses have been Everton\u2019s biggest threat \u2013 an admittedly relative term. 73 min Nice from Palace, Zaha flicking inside for Edouard, who moves out wide for Oliseh when the ball won\u2019t sit up for a shot, and his young mate sends an effort wide. 72 min Gray spreads to Coleman, who takes a touch, steadies, and picks out Richarlison at the far post. He might nod across, but instead goes for goal, getting right under an effort that Butland seizes. Everton, though, are in the ascendancy. 71 min Vieira opts to freshen things up, removing Eze, who\u2019s not quite there yet, and Mateta; Milivojevic and Edouard come on. 69 min Michael Olise is going to the top and here he is again, shouldering away from Holgate and easing down the line, before wearing the inevitable foul. 68 min Calvert-Lewin is starting to influence proceedings, showing for the ball and bringing others into play. I\u2019m not totally sold on him as a top-level player, but Everton are so much better with him in the team. 67 min Better from Everton, a nice touch from Coleman finding Calvert-Lewin, who finds Gray, and he spins Kouyate beautifully then, on the turn, lashes an early shot that flies just wide of the far post. Everton have been a little bit better these last few minutes. 66 min \u201cI am sure that Gary Naylor will concur and recall from his Merseyside days that the voice of Clive Tydesley is etched in the psyche of Liverpool and Everton fans alike,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cOr at least those of us who used to get their footballing fix in the 1980s onwards by tuning in to Radio City and hearing Clive cut his teeth as the station\u2019s commentator.\u201d 64 min Olise has been great today, and collecting the ball just outside his own box, he skates around Gomes, wears the foul, and Gomes is booked. Like Gordon, he too will miss any semi in which Everton find themselves. Don\u2019t laugh. 63 min ...which he does, but Calvert-Lewin heads clear, then Olise, sprinting to press Gordon, knocks him over. 62 min A lovely touch from Gallagher sets Olise away down the right, so Gordon yanks him down and is booked; he\u2019ll be suspended for the semi, should Everton get there. Oliseh\u2019s dead-ball delivery has been on-point today, and he now has another chance to swerve in from the right... 61 min But here they come now, Coleman eschewing a chance to stick a ball into the mixer; eventually Holgate does so from the other side, and Butland collects easily enough. 60 min A quiet period, which is fine for Palace. Everton can\u2019t get enough of the ball to exert any pressure, but know that if they can finagle a goal, even if there are just a few minutes left, they\u2019re in with a chance. 58 min Calvert-Lewin goes over Kouyate, who looks winded but fine. And tangentially, how great was this? Football! 56 min It\u2019s great to hear Clive Tydesley commentating on a big game, as it is baffling how rarely that happens. He\u2019s miles better than the majority of those we hear on a regular \u2013 him, Peter Drury and Steve Wilson are the only ones who bring any personality to it, for mine. 55 min Palace are just miles better than Everton. A few moments ago, Olise tried to beat Holgate with a flick down the line, and though it didn\u2019t work, it showed greater skill and daring than anything have attempted in quite some time. 54 min \u201cI think if Everton go down there\u2019s a better than even chance we don\u2019t come back up, let alone \u2018bowl around\u2019 the Championship,\u201d tweets Robin Cannon. \u201cBad, overpriced squad, best players would leave, owner\u2019s money based on links with sanctioned Russian oligarch \u2026 not promising.\u201d Maybe, but I\u2019d be surprised. But I bet most Wigan fans still wouldn\u2019t swap the cup to still be in the Prem. 52 min Lovely feet from Zaha earn Palace a corner, but this time Guehi can\u2019t retreat enough to get the power he needs on his header. Laugh at me if I\u2019m wrong, but Everton look gone here. 51 min \u201cDo donkey jackets now come with a permanent soundtrack of the Only Fools and Horses theme tune,\u201d wonders Ian Copestake, \u201cor is this only happening inside my head?\u201d Or \u201cNisi stulti et equi,\u201d as Lampard calls it. 49 min Michael Olise allez allez! He wriggles around and through a pair of tackles inside the box \u2013 his ability to commit defenders is brilliant \u2013 earning a corner, which he again delivers wickedly. Nothing comes of it, though, and when the ball comes back, he\u2019s pulled fractionally offside. 47 min \u201cI agree,\u201d says Dean Kinsella. \u201cSo much to enjoy with this Palace team. Bucketloads of skill, enthusiasm and work rate \u2013 even the star players. And it really does look like Vieira is going to be a top top manager.\u201d I guess for most managers, it\u2019s more about finding a job that\u2019s right for them because only the best succeed everywhere. Palace seem perfect for Vieira. 46 min We go again. Everton send on Calvert-Lewin for Kenny. Decide for yourselves: Looking at the goals, it was Richarlison who lost Guehi, leaving him from the corner; Leicester are the only team to have conceded more set-piece goals than Everton this season. Wrighty, meanwhile, doesn\u2019t blame Pickford for the second, but I\u2019m not sure \u2013 the finish wasn\u2019t in corner, and he might\u2019ve dived over it. Half-time entertainment: a classic from the archives. Everton started well, but lost momentum when Townsend got injured and Palace\u2019s superior confidence and class is now telling. 45+2 min Palace should make it three! A lovely cushioned header from Olise sends Mateta in, but when he should shoot he takes a touch, allowing Coleman to slide in and unload him. Great challenge, but should never have smelled it. 45 min There\u2019ll be four added minutes. There should be more, but you just never get what you should get, especially prior to half-time. The single most significant change we should make to the game is 30 minutes ball-in-play time, with control over it taken away from refs. How quickly you can, for example, run into the net to wrestle the ball from a goalkeeper, Brian McClair-style, should not have an impact on the result of a football match. 43 min It\u2019s worth noting that Richarlison opted not to finish with his left foot, making things hard for himself and getting nowhere, then 30 seconds later, Mateta relied on his because it was the right thing to do, and now look! This is a lovely goal! On halfway, Zaha controls beautifully and sends Eze away down the line, collecting the return-pass before crossing low for the onrushing Mateta to use its direction to sweep across Pickford and towards the far corner! Perhaps the keeper should do better, perhaps, but that\u2019s a beautifully-worked goal. 40 min Nice again from Everton, Coleman doing superbly to ease out of defence before lofting a pass over the top for Richarlison, who outpaces Guehi, allows it to drop across his body, and uses the outside of his right foot to shoot when really he might\u2019ve lashed it with his left. Still, decent effort though it\u2019s fielded easily enough by Butland. 39 min Kenny loops one over the top for Richarlison, but Kouyate sees him and it out, just. 37 min If Palace can hang onto their best players this summer and go at the market again, they could do some serious damage next season. Never has there been as many talented players in the world as now, and the richest clubs can\u2019t stockpile them all. 36 min ...but Godfrey heads Kenny\u2019s delivery wide. 35 min Gallagher is the latest to foul Kenny, who\u2019s having a rough afternoon. His ankles will have some colour to them, and following the free-kick, Everton win a corner... 33 min Here come Palace again, Mateta running in behind from centre to right and collecting a decent long hump from Clyne before drilling a low cross towards the near post ... and Zaha is paying more attention than Godfrey, sprinting onto the ball to turn a first-time shot just wide of the near post. That\u2019s a warning for Everton. 32 min Gray directs the free-kick towards Holgate at the back post, but the flag is up for offside. 31 min I\u2019ve been banging on about Palace\u2019s attacking thrust, but they\u2019ve got plenty at the back too. Mitchell, who\u2019s just booted Gordon, is a very promising young player, while Guehi and Andersen are physical, solid and intelligent. 30 min Yeah, Palace are taking control of this one. 28 min You fear for Everton now. It\u2019s all very well starting nicely, but when confidence is fragile, it doesn\u2019t take much to eliminate it and refresh deep-set insecurities. Meantime, Gomes flashes a shot wide of the near post; Butland dives, but he knew it wasn\u2019t going on. This is so easy, another nasty corner swerved in by Olise that Guehi flicks across Pickford and inside the far post! Everton\u2019s fast start has earned them the princely reward of absolutely nothing! 25 min A poor pass from Gallagher sets Olise away down the right, the winger doing a terrific job of getting his left foot outsider the ball to keep it on, skirting around Gomes who concedes a corner ... that yields another, Olise with the gumption to have a dig direct from the flag that Pickford can only force around his near post... 24 min Thinking more about Everton\u2019s approach here, I\u2019m sure Lampard will be wanting his players to keep the ball away from their defence to the maximum possible extent. He\u2019s gone for the safety in numbers of five at the back, but won\u2019t want to invite pressure. 22 min Andre Gomes is putting himself about, and when his high foot catches Gallagher in the head as Gallagher nods the ball away from him. He\u2019s penalised, but somehow avoids a booking. 20 min First bit of Palace: Kenny controls beautifully then loses possession, allowing Zaha to punch a pass into Eze ... who turns well and shoots wide. A serious cup-tie is brewing. 18 min \u201cI caught the 2nd half of the Everton-Newcastle game,\u201d emails Mac Millings, \u201cand the atmosphere felt positively. .. I believe the preferred word is \u2018febrile\u2019, and that was *before* the Allan sending off. When the goal went in (and what a good goal it was), the sudden switch from fury to euphoria was intoxicating. Or it would have been, but, speaking as a Watford supporter, it was (with apologies to Gary Naylor, Matt Burtz, Mary Waltz, and all Students of Science) something closer to gut-wrenching. Stupid bloody football, I love it and hate it so much.\u201d Yup, it was a good one \u2013 even for the neutral, as in terms of relative fun, Everton are the preferred relegation candidates. 17 min Yup, Townsend is off the stretcher but also off to the dressing room, helped by club staff; Gray, who started the season so well before losing form, is on. 15 min Ach, Townsend is carried off. He\u2019s still being treated, but the likelihood is that Gray will soon replace him. 13 min Lampard\u2019s use of full-backs with wide players in front is working well so far, but oh dear: Coleman beats Mitchell bear the corner flag, then Townsend charges across to pick up the loose ball and treads awkwardly, collapsing in a heap. That\u2019s a right sair yin, and though I hope the physios can get him going again, I\u2019m not sure. 11 min On Richarlison, I thought he\u2019d be further along now than he is. He\u2019s got a lot of the raw materials, but hasn\u2019t quite converted them into what the Talmud calls tachlis: perceptible contributions. 10 min I guess what Palace lack is a player to put a foot on it midfield, and as I type that, Everton\u2019s harrying wins them a free-kick out on the right. Richarlison is first to show for it too, but can only direct his near-post header wide. 8 min Palace have barely left their own half \u2013 Everton are into this. 7 min Gordon, who\u2019s a talent, turns on a bouncing ball and spins away from Kouyate \u2013 that\u2019s lovely \u2013 then twinkles through midfield and slides a ball in behind for Richarlison, who catches himself on Guehi, seeking a penalty. All he gets is an offside flag. 6 min Townsend curls to the back post where Holgate, underneath it, takes the ball away from the much better-placed Doucoure, heading over the top. 4 min Excellent start from Everton, Gomes hauling Zaha down and getting away with it; it yields a corner, then another! Everton have started like the clappers here! 3 min It\u2019s all going on! A heavy touch from Guehi has him lunging in, facing his own goal, to try and rob the onrushing Richarlison. And he gets away with it, just, Richarlison\u2019s touch not heavy enough to see him clear so the tackle gets just enough of the ball before clattering the man. This is a promising start. 2 min Everton win a free-kick out on the left and Townsend swings it in ... and Keane is onto it! I think he\u2019s offside, but he swivels into a shot that dribbles wide and, sliding in at the far post, Kenny can\u2019t quite catch up with it. 1 min The away end watched Wogan \u2013 they\u2019re singing the 1985 tune, though the 1995 one was alright too. 1 min Aaaaand off we go! The players take the knee, Zaha aside. All black lives matter. Who can think of Palace in the cup without reliving one of the greatest ties of them all? In many ways, this match \u2013 along with Oldham v Man United just after it \u2013 revolutionised football: it was too good for so little of it to be available on live telly. There\u2019s a decent atmosphere at Selhurst, and here come the teams! Vieira tells ITV he\u2019s happy with his players, who are working hard and just need to focus on performance. Eze, he says, has been waiting for his chance so this is it, and more generally, he thinks this is a 50-50 game so his players need to be at it. I\u2019m really looking forward to seeing how Marc Guehi gets on today. He\u2019s made it into Gareth Southgate\u2019s most recent England squad - on which point, how on earth has Jack Grealish\u2019s form got him in ahead of Jadon Sancho, to say nothing of Hazza Maguire \u2013 and looks to have all the attributes. I daresay playing alongside Joachim Andersen, another excellent Vieira signing, is helping too. Email! \u201cI\u2019m only 40,\u201d emails Matt Burtz, \u201chaven\u2019t been supporting Everton for all my life (only about the last 10 years), and don\u2019t dare to speak for the entire fan base, but as much as Everton need a trophy, this is a club that has been in the top flight continuously since 1954. No club is too big to go down, obviously, but I think many would take survival and not winning the Cup over the reverse. Selfishly, it would be much harder for me to watch their games in the Championship, FWIW.\u201d Sure, nothing is uniform. But the way I see it, Everton go down, their fans get a season bowling about the Championship with games reliably on Saturday and Tuesday, get themselves promoted, and still have the take of when their team won the cup to sustain them. That sounds a lot more fun that another year of the almost-same \u2013 but obviously my sensibilities are not universal. Also on Lampard\u2019s selection, I should also note that both Dele Alli and Donny van de Beek are cuptied. Lampard, wearing some kind of donkey jacket, says he hopes his team take the impetus from Thursday night, but that they also need to freshen up. Begovic would\u2019ve played had he not been ill, but Pickford is back from illness, so comes in. Calvert-Lewin, on the bench here, had a small reaction from his sub appearance in midweek \u2013 not an injury \u2013 but with international break coming, should be good to go after that. People have been cancelled for admitting less, but I\u2019ve quite enjoyed the shifting of round five to midweek. A night-game automatically amps up the atmosphere, and much as I enjoy a replace or a second replay, getting it all finished on the night gives its own dramatic impetus. Semis and finals, though, should get a second game. As noted by Karen Carney in the link above, Conor Gallagher has a decision to make in the summer. I wonder if Chelsea will be able to offer him enough games to keep him happy \u2013 they should find a way if they can \u2013 because if they can\u2019t, he might feel obliged to leave. I\u2019m sure Palace would fancy having him another year, but they also want to build, and there might be teams above them who fancy investing in the return of the midfielder who just plays in the middle of the pitch. And for balance, Ian Wright is now talking about his incredible contribution to the 1990 cup final, also noting that after Palace lost the replay, Bryan Robson told him he\u2019d be back. He was. More recently \u2013 Thursday night recently \u2013 this was brilliant. Football! Of course, for the old gits among us, it\u2019s impossible to conceive of Everton in the FA Cup without immediately conceiving on 1985\u2019s seminal Wogan appearance. As for Everton, ITV think they\u2019re playing 3-4-3 and maybe they are. But my guess is that they\u2019re more circumspect than that, with Townsend and Gordon staying wide and protecting their full-backs before they think about supporting Richarlison. In terms of personnel, Jordan Pickford replaces Asmir Begovic in net, while Andre Gomes, Jonjoe Kenny and Andros Townsend also start in place of Allan, Alex Iwobi and Demarai Gray. Ian Wright has rightly been installed as a national treasure in recent times, but it is nevertheless incumbent upon me to advise that he\u2019s wearing an olive syoot with a black cap of the sort worn when goalies were \u201ccustodians\u201d, and black shoes. Strength and comfort to us all at this difficult time. Tell you what, that Palace front six is seriously tasty. Michael Olise looks an absolute player, Conor Gallagher is special, Eze is beautiful on the ball \u2013 and we\u2019ve not even mentioned Wilfried Zaha. It\u2019s hard not to fancy them. So what does it all mean? Well, Patrick Vieira makes two changes to the side so impressive against City: in net, Jack Butland might\u2019ve now established himself as first choice, and he takes over from Vicente Guaita, while in midfield, Eberechi Eze, still feeling his way back after a nasty achilles injury, replaces Jeffrey Schlupp. Crystal Palace (a modern 4-3-3-): Butland; Clyne, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell; Kouyate, Gallagher, Eze; Olise, Mateta, Zaha. Subs: Guaita, Ward, Tomkins, Kelly, Milivojevic, Riedewald, Hughes, Edouard, Benteke. Everton (a desperate 5-4-1): Pickford; Coleman, Holgate, Godfrey, Keane, Kenny; Townsend. Doucoure, Gomes, Gordon; Richarlison. Subs: Lonergan, Tyrer, Patterson, Calvert-Lewin, Gray, Iwobi, Mykolenko, Branthwaite, Price. Let\u2019s start with some trivia: what is unique about Wigan Athletic in 2013? And what has only been done by Manchester City in 1926, Leicester City in 1969, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion in 1983, Middlesbrough in 1997 and Portsmouth in 2010?... ... ...Wigan are the only team to have won the FA Cup and been relegated in the same season, while the others were losing finalists who were relegated. I daresay a significant majority of Everton fans Evertonians, without a trophy since 1995, would take the former just as alacritously as so many Wiganers did, and why not? A day to remember forever, immortalised in the annals of humanity, rather than another season of nondescript nothingness in a league that has passed them by. The suits might feel differently, but that\u2019s just another part of what makes it all so appealing. Perhaps, though, Thursday night\u2019s gloriously absurd win over Palace represents a momentum shift: Everton stay up easily and win the Cup too, the football world flabbergasted by the full flowering of Frank\u2019s managerial genius. Perhaps. Palace, meanwhile, have their own tale of woe they\u2019d like to assuage, reaching two finals, in 1990 and 2016, only to be beaten in both by poor Manchester United sides \u2013 to say nothing of Alan Pardew\u2019s dancing. OK, to say something of it, for it remains extremely amusing. But they\u2019re an entirely different proposition these days, a young, dynamic and enterprising outfit with the firepower to trouble anyone, who just this week were solid enough to restrict Man City to nil. This is a chance for then they know it. Or, put another way, what should be a terrific cup-tie awaits us. Here we go, here we go, here we go! Kick-off: 12.30pm GMT",

But after two years of cancellations and delays, music lovers can once again look forward to an array of festivals and gigs this summer.</p> <p>From <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/04/paul-mccartney-and-kendrick-lamar-to-headline-glastonbury-2022\">Paul McCartney at Glastonbury</a> and Tyler, the Creator at Parklife, to Adele and Elton John at BST Hyde Park and Liam Gallagher at the Etihad Stadium, there\u2019s something in the music calendar for everyone.</p> <p>\u201cSummer 2022 marks the beginning of the next era of the musical summer season,\u201d said Emily Eavis, co-organiser of Glastonbury festival, which is returning in June for the first time since 2019.</p> <p>Alongside headliners McCartney, Kendrick Lamar and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/oct/04/billie-eilish-youngest-solo-glastonbury-headliner-2022\">Billie Eilish</a>, the festival has announced more than 80 names so far, including Olivia Rodrigo and Diana Ross.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62d7c19d832aad527d813563aec1b2433a10f3e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62d7c19d832aad527d813563aec1b2433a10f3e5/0_0_2583_1550/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul McCartney, Kendrick Lamar, Kacey Musgraves, Olivia Rodrigo and Megan Thee Stallion.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">(Clockwise from centre) Glastonbury 2022 acts Paul McCartney, Kendrick Lamar, Kacey Musgraves, Olivia Rodrigo and Megan Thee Stallion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: AP/Getty/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAll gigs are back, festivals will return with bells on and people will be streaming through many gates all summer long full of excitement,\u201d Eavis said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge relief that these life-affirming gatherings are back, and it feels like we have actually turned a corner in this long, difficult pandemic trajectory. We can\u2019t wait to welcome people back to Worthy Farm.\u201d</p> <p>Not only has music helped shape Britain\u2019s identity, but the UK music industry contributed \u00a35.8bn to the economy pre-pandemic, according to UK Music, the umbrella organisation representing the commercial music industry from artists and record labels to the live music sector. The industry now has the potential to play a key role in the nation\u2019s recovery from the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cLive music is emerging from a Covid-enforced hibernation that saw around a third of jobs right across the music industry wiped out and many stages empty for almost two years,\u201d said the UK Music chief executive, Jamie Njoku-Goodwin.</p> <p>\u201cThe absence of live music left a big hole in many people\u2019s lives and helped us realise the power of music when it comes to lifting people\u2019s spirits and having fun.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been an awful two years for the whole industry \u2013 but there is now a cautious optimism that we\u2019ve turned a corner and everyone is determined to deliver the best summer of festivals and gigs ever.\u201d</p> <p>Other hugely popular acts billed this year include Ed Sheeran and AJ Tracey at Radio 1\u2019s Big Weekend, a stadium tour by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, the Rolling Stones at BST Hyde Park, Muse at Isle of Wight and Iron Maiden at Download.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0837aca5b3c7926e11ae8c61c93d8879be67ef51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0837aca5b3c7926e11ae8c61c93d8879be67ef51/83_83_3323_1994/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ed Sheeran performing at BBC Radio 1\u2019s Big Weekend in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ed Sheeran performing at BBC Radio 1\u2019s Big Weekend in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt very much feels like the return is very real and its significance for us as promoters, but also for artists and attendees, is huge,\u201d said Melvin Benn, the managing director of Festival Republic, which is behind some of the UK\u2019s biggest festivals including Latitude, Wilderness, Reading and Leeds and Wireless.</p> <p>Though a significant number of festivals \u2013 including Creamfields, Parklife, Tramlines and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/aug/30/reading-leeds-festival-review-stormzy-liam-gallagher\">Reading and Leeds \u2013 returned last year</a>, there is a heady feeling of ceremony about this summer, as all restrictions seem to be firmly in the past. Alongside the huge, staple events, countless grassroots festivals and concerts are popping up nationwide.</p> <p>Ben Cross, the founder of Cloud X, an entertainment company that operates a record label and runs live events, including the Cloud X festival which launched last year, said: \u201cThis summer in Britain is going to be absolutely amazing.</p> <p>\u201cThe pandemic highlighted the importance of not only recognising but investing in and celebrating underrepresented communities.

      "bodyText": "For a while it felt so far away: listening to your favourite artist, pints flying overhead, queueing for portable toilets, losing your friends and finding new ones. But after two years of cancellations and delays, music lovers can once again look forward to an array of festivals and gigs this summer. From Paul McCartney at Glastonbury and Tyler, the Creator at Parklife, to Adele and Elton John at BST Hyde Park and Liam Gallagher at the Etihad Stadium, there\u2019s something in the music calendar for everyone. \u201cSummer 2022 marks the beginning of the next era of the musical summer season,\u201d said Emily Eavis, co-organiser of Glastonbury festival, which is returning in June for the first time since 2019. Alongside headliners McCartney, Kendrick Lamar and Billie Eilish, the festival has announced more than 80 names so far, including Olivia Rodrigo and Diana Ross. \u201cAll gigs are back, festivals will return with bells on and people will be streaming through many gates all summer long full of excitement,\u201d Eavis said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge relief that these life-affirming gatherings are back, and it feels like we have actually turned a corner in this long, difficult pandemic trajectory. We can\u2019t wait to welcome people back to Worthy Farm.\u201d Not only has music helped shape Britain\u2019s identity, but the UK music industry contributed \u00a35.8bn to the economy pre-pandemic, according to UK Music, the umbrella organisation representing the commercial music industry from artists and record labels to the live music sector. The industry now has the potential to play a key role in the nation\u2019s recovery from the pandemic. \u201cLive music is emerging from a Covid-enforced hibernation that saw around a third of jobs right across the music industry wiped out and many stages empty for almost two years,\u201d said the UK Music chief executive, Jamie Njoku-Goodwin. \u201cThe absence of live music left a big hole in many people\u2019s lives and helped us realise the power of music when it comes to lifting people\u2019s spirits and having fun. \u201cIt\u2019s been an awful two years for the whole industry \u2013 but there is now a cautious optimism that we\u2019ve turned a corner and everyone is determined to deliver the best summer of festivals and gigs ever.\u201d Other hugely popular acts billed this year include Ed Sheeran and AJ Tracey at Radio 1\u2019s Big Weekend, a stadium tour by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, the Rolling Stones at BST Hyde Park, Muse at Isle of Wight and Iron Maiden at Download. \u201cIt very much feels like the return is very real and its significance for us as promoters, but also for artists and attendees, is huge,\u201d said Melvin Benn, the managing director of Festival Republic, which is behind some of the UK\u2019s biggest festivals including Latitude, Wilderness, Reading and Leeds and Wireless. Though a significant number of festivals \u2013 including Creamfields, Parklife, Tramlines and Reading and Leeds \u2013 returned last year, there is a heady feeling of ceremony about this summer, as all restrictions seem to be firmly in the past. Alongside the huge, staple events, countless grassroots festivals and concerts are popping up nationwide. Ben Cross, the founder of Cloud X, an entertainment company that operates a record label and runs live events, including the Cloud X festival which launched last year, said: \u201cThis summer in Britain is going to be absolutely amazing. \u201cThe pandemic highlighted the importance of not only recognising but investing in and celebrating underrepresented communities. Being able to continue this mission feels liberating. Roll on the summer of love.\u201d According to data from the Association of Independent Festivals (AIF), more than 50% of UK festivals with capacity of 5,000 and over cancelled or postponed in 2021, after the season was wiped out by Covid in 2020. Paul Reed, the chief executive of AIF, said: \u201cWe are certain, at this stage, that summer 2022 will see a full return to the fields but we still need support to aid this recovery. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have repeatedly called on government to maintain the current reduced 12.5% rate on tickets beyond the end of March. It remains a very challenging time for festival organisers, with pressures along the supply chain, loss of skilled workforce, Brexit complications around movement of artists and crew, and a 20-30% increase in infrastructure costs across the board.\u201d UK Music has also urged the chancellor to ditch the \u201chugely damaging\u201d VAT hike on concert and live event tickets that is due to kick in on 1 April \u2013 a move that promoters and music industry chiefs are concerned could force a rise in ticket prices. \u201cThe demand for tickets this year is significant, so all of my shows are in a really strong position,\u201d Benn said. \u201cBut unless the government extend the VAT break we will definitely not make up what we lost in 2020 and to a lesser extent 2021.\u201d",

The RSPB said it was \u201cshocked and saddened\u201d by the fire which it said had \u201cdevastated\u201d the Neston reedbed, part of its Burton Mere Wetlands reserve. The charity said the full extent of the damage was being assessed and it would share further details once more information emerges. A spokesperson added: \u201cWe\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank the emergency services for all they\u2019ve done so far in helping to tackle and investigate the fire.\u201d Cheshire constabulary appealed to the public for information and said they were particularly keen to talk to a group of teenagers seen in the area at 6.20pm. The three boys and a girl are described as being aged between 14 and 15. The girl had long dark hair and was wearing a dark jacket. The two boys were wearing dark jackets and the third teenager was wearing a light blue jacket and trousers. The fire could be seen for miles around, and dramatic images and video were shared on social media. One Twitter user described the fire as a \u201cdreadful sight\u201d. Another wrote: \u201cThis is terrible and a disaster for wildlife at the start of the breeding season.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Exactly two years ago Prof Sir Andrew Pollard was starting to panic. \u201cWe were just waking up to the reality of Covid-19 and that we would need vaccines for our very survival,\u201d the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group told the Guardian last week. He joined forces with a colleague, Prof Dame Sarah Gilbert, and together they launched one of the greatest medical missions in modern history. Their seemingly impossible task \u2013 to design, develop and deliver a vaccine from scratch to slow the advance of a lethal pandemic \u2013 was completed in less than 12 months, to the relief of millions.</p> <p>Today though, the coronavirus landscape \u2013 and the status of their jab, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 \u2013 looks very different. In the UK, half the population have had their vaccine, restrictions have ended, and while cases and hospitalisations are rising in the UK, a dramatic uptick in deaths is not expected. The jab has saved more than a million lives, according to estimates, but its reputation has been battered by a toxic mix of misinformation, miscommunication and mishaps. Two years after Pollard, Gilbert and their teams first began making the miracle jab now known as Vaxzevria or Covishield, it has been sidelined in the UK and Europe, and snubbed in the US.</p> <p>Instead, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is gearing up for what will probably be its final act: saving the rest of the world. About 2.6bn doses of it have been distributed to 183 countries, but 3 billion people have yet to receive a first dose of any Covid jab. The highly infectious Omicron variant is flagging in the west, but new cases are soaring in less-vaccinated areas. Globally, daily cases remain high, averaging about 1.8m \u2013 three times the 600,000 a day in December. Cases are rising in the Middle East, Asia and Latin America, and the low cost and ease with which the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine could be deployed to these regions, as well as the more \u201cinaccessible parts of the world\u201d, meant the jab could still play a crucial role in helping end the pandemic, Pollard said.</p> <p>\u201cProtecting people elsewhere is also important for our own defence,\u201d he added. The current vaccine gap could open the door to a deadly new variant, which is why he believes the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab\u2019s ultimate legacy will be to build a \u201cglobal wall of immunity\u201d in 2022 \u2013 saving more lives in low- and middle-income parts of the world but also slashing the risk of new variants arriving in the UK and elsewhere.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/03/archive-zip/giv-825BtzViZpik5NY/\" data-alt=\"supply agreements\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/03/archive-zip/giv-825BtzViZpik5NY/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>While Pollard takes \u201chuge satisfaction\u201d from \u201ca team of boffins\u201d developing a jab that has been so widely used, he admitted the last two years had not been straightforward, adding: \u201cMisinformation has undermined confidence in the vaccine.\u201d Particularly damaging, he said, was a story from Germany in January 2021 incorrectly claiming the jab had only 8% efficacy in elderly people. Looking back at the behaviour of politicians who pushed the \u201cnonsense\u201d claims, Pollard was scathing. \u201cPresident Macron amplified the story globally by claiming the vaccine was \u2018quasi-ineffective\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is difficult to fathom why he would make such a comment in the midst of the Alpha wave with thousands dying across the continent, but the damage was done.\u201d</p> <p>Hours later the European Medicines Agency approved its use for all ages, but many countries still opted not to use the vaccine for their elderly people. \u201cThe rhetoric undermined confidence in the vaccine, undoubtedly costing lives,\u201d said Pollard. Delayed deliveries and lower efficacy rates than mRNA jabs have also not helped the Oxford/AstraZeneca cause.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/26/the-oxford-vaccine-the-trials-and-tribulations-of-a-world-saving-jab\">The Oxford vaccine: the trials and tribulations of a world-saving jab</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But other scientists have a different take on the jab\u2019s bumpy ride \u2013 suggesting those involved with its development are also to blame. The lack of older people in its trials compared with the mRNA studies, for example, was a \u201cbig issue\u201d, Prof Paul Hunter, of the University of East Anglia, told the Guardian. \u201cGiven that these age groups were always going to be the number one priority, not including them was a mistake.\u201d Dr Julian Tang, a clinical virologist at Leicester University who previously worked on respiratory virus outbreaks in Hong Kong and Singapore, is also critical of the \u201coverly complex\u201d early Oxford/AstraZeneca trials. Reflecting on them this week, what still strikes him now was their \u201cuneven make-up\u201d with \u201cno elderly initially, and few BAME participants\u201d. </p> <p>Hunter and Tang also raise the dosing debacle. A blunder meant some doses given to volunteers were only half-strength.

      "bodyText": "Exactly two years ago Prof Sir Andrew Pollard was starting to panic. \u201cWe were just waking up to the reality of Covid-19 and that we would need vaccines for our very survival,\u201d the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group told the Guardian last week. He joined forces with a colleague, Prof Dame Sarah Gilbert, and together they launched one of the greatest medical missions in modern history. Their seemingly impossible task \u2013 to design, develop and deliver a vaccine from scratch to slow the advance of a lethal pandemic \u2013 was completed in less than 12 months, to the relief of millions. Today though, the coronavirus landscape \u2013 and the status of their jab, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 \u2013 looks very different. In the UK, half the population have had their vaccine, restrictions have ended, and while cases and hospitalisations are rising in the UK, a dramatic uptick in deaths is not expected. The jab has saved more than a million lives, according to estimates, but its reputation has been battered by a toxic mix of misinformation, miscommunication and mishaps. Two years after Pollard, Gilbert and their teams first began making the miracle jab now known as Vaxzevria or Covishield, it has been sidelined in the UK and Europe, and snubbed in the US. Instead, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is gearing up for what will probably be its final act: saving the rest of the world. About 2.6bn doses of it have been distributed to 183 countries, but 3 billion people have yet to receive a first dose of any Covid jab. The highly infectious Omicron variant is flagging in the west, but new cases are soaring in less-vaccinated areas. Globally, daily cases remain high, averaging about 1.8m \u2013 three times the 600,000 a day in December. Cases are rising in the Middle East, Asia and Latin America, and the low cost and ease with which the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine could be deployed to these regions, as well as the more \u201cinaccessible parts of the world\u201d, meant the jab could still play a crucial role in helping end the pandemic, Pollard said. \u201cProtecting people elsewhere is also important for our own defence,\u201d he added. The current vaccine gap could open the door to a deadly new variant, which is why he believes the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab\u2019s ultimate legacy will be to build a \u201cglobal wall of immunity\u201d in 2022 \u2013 saving more lives in low- and middle-income parts of the world but also slashing the risk of new variants arriving in the UK and elsewhere. While Pollard takes \u201chuge satisfaction\u201d from \u201ca team of boffins\u201d developing a jab that has been so widely used, he admitted the last two years had not been straightforward, adding: \u201cMisinformation has undermined confidence in the vaccine.\u201d Particularly damaging, he said, was a story from Germany in January 2021 incorrectly claiming the jab had only 8% efficacy in elderly people. Looking back at the behaviour of politicians who pushed the \u201cnonsense\u201d claims, Pollard was scathing. \u201cPresident Macron amplified the story globally by claiming the vaccine was \u2018quasi-ineffective\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is difficult to fathom why he would make such a comment in the midst of the Alpha wave with thousands dying across the continent, but the damage was done.\u201d Hours later the European Medicines Agency approved its use for all ages, but many countries still opted not to use the vaccine for their elderly people. \u201cThe rhetoric undermined confidence in the vaccine, undoubtedly costing lives,\u201d said Pollard. Delayed deliveries and lower efficacy rates than mRNA jabs have also not helped the Oxford/AstraZeneca cause. But other scientists have a different take on the jab\u2019s bumpy ride \u2013 suggesting those involved with its development are also to blame. The lack of older people in its trials compared with the mRNA studies, for example, was a \u201cbig issue\u201d, Prof Paul Hunter, of the University of East Anglia, told the Guardian. \u201cGiven that these age groups were always going to be the number one priority, not including them was a mistake.\u201d Dr Julian Tang, a clinical virologist at Leicester University who previously worked on respiratory virus outbreaks in Hong Kong and Singapore, is also critical of the \u201coverly complex\u201d early Oxford/AstraZeneca trials. Reflecting on them this week, what still strikes him now was their \u201cuneven make-up\u201d with \u201cno elderly initially, and few BAME participants\u201d. Hunter and Tang also raise the dosing debacle. A blunder meant some doses given to volunteers were only half-strength. The initial half-dose jab received by about 3,000 British patients proved far more effective than the full dose that up to 20,000 Brazilians received. The efficacy rate in Britain was 90%, compared with 62% in Brazil. The overall rate of 70% sowed huge confusion, especially when compared with the much clearer results of trials by Pfizer and Moderna. The final straw for some came in March 2021.

At the time I was playing Sandra, the booze-fuelled, fag-ashed, unapologetically selfish and morally questionable baby-boomer heroine in a revival of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/12/love-love-love-review-mike-bartlett-rachael-stirling-lyric-hammersmith\">Mike Bartlett\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/12/love-love-love-review-mike-bartlett-rachael-stirling-lyric-hammersmith\">Love, Love, Love</a></em> at the Lyric Hammersmith theatre. The audiences gasped and howled at what an appalling mother she was, while being beguiled by her eye-bleeding honesty. Our press night performance was riotous. There was delicious rowdy chaos in the audience, and audible wincing as Sandra informed her daughter, on her 16th birthday, that both parents have had affairs and will soon be getting a divorce, all the while cheerfully handing out slices of cake. Something in the airwaves told us to enjoy the moment while it lasted. It lasted for four performances.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I missed the chaos of live performance\u2026 it\u2019s surprisingly easy to filibuster in the style of Terence Rattigan, less so Shakespeare</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I had just found out that my Ma had cancer, so while the show being forced to shut down was sad, in truth my world was already shattered. Pro that she was, Ma didn\u2019t want to tell me until after that first night. She always came to first nights. She always gave notes. My first newspaper review in a show was mostly a review about Ma arriving late, looking glam in her leopardskin shawl: \u201cNo need to Rigg Rachael\u2019s verdict\u201d was the headline. <em>Love, Love, Love</em> was the last play she ever saw. She didn\u2019t have any notes. But as I packed up my dressing room that day, I had no idea that I was about to become my mother\u2019s full-time carer, or that in six months she would be dead.</p> <p>A year later, and people, like theatres, were trying to survive. Some more successfully than others. I was on set in Cardiff, doing a telly job. I got a text from Mike Bartlett saying: \u201cI\u2019m writing a play and I seem to be writing a part for you in it\u201d. I have worked with Mike for more than a decade now, but I still like to think it was the spirit of Sandra bullying him into reincarnation, because Susan Climber is definitely a relative. She is larger than life, a shoot-from-the-hip heroine for our times.</p> <p>Mike\u2019s new play was called <em>Scandaltown</em>. He had sent it to Rachel O\u2019Riordan, artistic director of the Lyric Hammersmith, and our director of <em>Love, Love, Love</em>. Mike and Rachel had talked about how the architecture of the Lyric was made to stage Restoration drama. Fast-forward to Christmas 2020 and someone had given Mike\u2019s son a cardboard toy proscenium arch theatre with cardboard actors you could push on and off. (If only.)</p> <p>\u201cIn the midst of lockdown,\u201d Mike remembers, \u201cit reminded me of the Lyric Hammersmith, and that conversation, and the subject of those plays \u2013 facade and gossip and a corrupt elite in London. Exactly where we are today. The form and the content fit.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"284866dc4243ec37cabd61c946107f0d70950bb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/284866dc4243ec37cabd61c946107f0d70950bb7/0_201_3936_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rachael Stirling, right, as Sandra in Mike Bartlett\u2019s Love, Love, Love at the Lyric theatre, March 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rachael Stirling, right, as Sandra in Mike Bartlett\u2019s Love, Love, Love at the Lyric theatre, March 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wouldn\u2019t it be great, thought he, to come back to theatre with a new play that had the energy of restoration, the joy of <em>Love, Love, Love</em> but that speaks to an audience directly about <em>today</em>. \u201cI want it to be a really good night out,\u201d Mike says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got less money, there is still Covid. How can it be as provocative as a new play should be, but you aren\u2019t being hit over the head with something too blunt\u2026 you\u2019re really pleased you came.\u201d</p> <p>Hello, March 2022, and I\u2019m once again standing on the stage of this beautiful Frank Matcham gold\u2019n\u2019gilt auditorium. You can whisper from up here and still be heard at the back of the gods. No member of the audience is more than 64ft away. This is particularly juicy because that delicious conspiracy between audience and actor is the game-changer in Restoration comedy. There is no fourth wall malarkey. I am bona fide allowed to talk to the audience and play with the congregation and to be as naughty as I please. In fact, it is actively encouraged. If they don\u2019t like it, the audience can say so, they can heckle.</p> <p><em>Scandaltown</em> is a great big, sexy, smart, occasionally crass, rock\u2019n\u2019roll piece of theatre. It takes the form of Restoration comedy but is set <em>now</em>. It makes merry of the cross-generational cyber-divide, while never making judgment. It reflects the facade of social media and hypocrisy of politicians, while smiling with real kindness at our shared human folly. It embraces modern life, and gently points out we are all a bit ridiculous to boot.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is the stuff that brought people flooding back to the theatre after it was banned for two decades under Cromwell</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is the stuff that brought people flooding back to the theatre after it was banned for two decades under Oliver Cromwell in the 17th century. Restoration theatre became the Church of the Outrageous. Not only were there real live women on stage but there was pisstakery of the powers that be, indecorous behaviour, cross-dressing, sex of all kinds between all genders and classes, and extravagant costumes as the icing on the toothsome cultural cake. From king to pauper, houses were packed: people were hungry for joy after the drought of Puritanism.</p> <p>The Lyric Hammersmith is subsidised, but it is really owned by its community, more so than by the actors who play in it. The first preview of every show there is free to the locals. It is always very loud and totally different to those with paying audiences. If they stay for the second half, it\u2019s a triumph, because the audience haven\u2019t spent anything to be there so it has to be genuine interest that makes them stay. I imagine that there might be a kid in the audience that night who falls in love with theatre, and <em>I</em> do it for them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6af652da380db5f185dcd9d1e934d146b66a0ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6af652da380db5f185dcd9d1e934d146b66a0ee/0_75_3193_1916/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stirling with her mother, Diana Rigg, at the Love, Love, Love press night, March 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stirling with her mother, Diana Rigg, at the Love, Love, Love press night, March 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Wooller/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have so missed the chaos of live performance. Over my 25-year career, I have slipped in a pool of blood and luged gusset first into the front row. I have been garrotted by scenery. I\u2019ve seen a game dame slowly roll down a raked stage after a fairy forgot to put the brakes on her bower. I have seen wonderful actors completely forget the plot and occasionally forget to come on altogether. It\u2019s surprisingly easy to filibuster in the style of Terence Rattigan, less so Shakespeare. I once whacked an actor over the head with a fan so hard that it snapped altogether. The two of us were unable to speak for laughing at the floppy prop. The audience saw what had happened, and there followed communal hysteria. It spread like a giggling Mexican wave. It was heaven.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>First day of rehearsals for <em>Scandaltown</em> and, as per norm, everyone stands in a circle in the rehearsal room and says who they are and what they do. It\u2019s a bit first-day-of-school-y, but this time it feels different. Sixty theatre people in a room together feels like \u201ca statement of intent for the future of theatre\u201d, says Rachel O\u2019Riordan, and it does, it feels like an act of defiance. Our first-aider makes a gag about rashes, and everyone laughs. Meanwhile I am projectile crying at the sight of so many familiar faces in this same rehearsal room, two years on, without my Ma in the world. I manage to get away with it, just about, by making a lame joke about being really grateful to be employed. (This is also true.)</p> <p>I miss my ma more than words. I shall do this joyous job in her honour, and with her spirit by my side. I imagine what she would say to me before our first show. She would say to me what she always said to me before every show, she would say: \u201cGo fly, my girl.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://lyric.co.uk/shows/scandaltown/\">Scandaltown</a></em> is at Lyric Hammersmith, London W6 from 7 April to 14 May</p>",

My first newspaper review in a show was mostly a review about Ma arriving late, looking glam in her leopardskin shawl: \u201cNo need to Rigg Rachael\u2019s verdict\u201d was the headline. Love, Love, Love was the last play she ever saw. She didn\u2019t have any notes. But as I packed up my dressing room that day, I had no idea that I was about to become my mother\u2019s full-time carer, or that in six months she would be dead. A year later, and people, like theatres, were trying to survive. Some more successfully than others. I was on set in Cardiff, doing a telly job. I got a text from Mike Bartlett saying: \u201cI\u2019m writing a play and I seem to be writing a part for you in it\u201d. I have worked with Mike for more than a decade now, but I still like to think it was the spirit of Sandra bullying him into reincarnation, because Susan Climber is definitely a relative. She is larger than life, a shoot-from-the-hip heroine for our times. Mike\u2019s new play was called Scandaltown. He had sent it to Rachel O\u2019Riordan, artistic director of the Lyric Hammersmith, and our director of Love, Love, Love. Mike and Rachel had talked about how the architecture of the Lyric was made to stage Restoration drama. Fast-forward to Christmas 2020 and someone had given Mike\u2019s son a cardboard toy proscenium arch theatre with cardboard actors you could push on and off. (If only.) \u201cIn the midst of lockdown,\u201d Mike remembers, \u201cit reminded me of the Lyric Hammersmith, and that conversation, and the subject of those plays \u2013 facade and gossip and a corrupt elite in London. Exactly where we are today. The form and the content fit.\u201d Wouldn\u2019t it be great, thought he, to come back to theatre with a new play that had the energy of restoration, the joy of Love, Love, Love but that speaks to an audience directly about today. \u201cI want it to be a really good night out,\u201d Mike says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got less money, there is still Covid. How can it be as provocative as a new play should be, but you aren\u2019t being hit over the head with something too blunt\u2026 you\u2019re really pleased you came.\u201d Hello, March 2022, and I\u2019m once again standing on the stage of this beautiful Frank Matcham gold\u2019n\u2019gilt auditorium. You can whisper from up here and still be heard at the back of the gods. No member of the audience is more than 64ft away. This is particularly juicy because that delicious conspiracy between audience and actor is the game-changer in Restoration comedy. There is no fourth wall malarkey. I am bona fide allowed to talk to the audience and play with the congregation and to be as naughty as I please. In fact, it is actively encouraged. If they don\u2019t like it, the audience can say so, they can heckle. Scandaltown is a great big, sexy, smart, occasionally crass, rock\u2019n\u2019roll piece of theatre. It takes the form of Restoration comedy but is set now. It makes merry of the cross-generational cyber-divide, while never making judgment. It reflects the facade of social media and hypocrisy of politicians, while smiling with real kindness at our shared human folly. It embraces modern life, and gently points out we are all a bit ridiculous to boot. This is the stuff that brought people flooding back to the theatre after it was banned for two decades under Oliver Cromwell in the 17th century. Restoration theatre became the Church of the Outrageous. Not only were there real live women on stage but there was pisstakery of the powers that be, indecorous behaviour, cross-dressing, sex of all kinds between all genders and classes, and extravagant costumes as the icing on the toothsome cultural cake. From king to pauper, houses were packed: people were hungry for joy after the drought of Puritanism. The Lyric Hammersmith is subsidised, but it is really owned by its community, more so than by the actors who play in it. The first preview of every show there is free to the locals. It is always very loud and totally different to those with paying audiences. If they stay for the second half, it\u2019s a triumph, because the audience haven\u2019t spent anything to be there so it has to be genuine interest that makes them stay. I imagine that there might be a kid in the audience that night who falls in love with theatre, and I do it for them. I have so missed the chaos of live performance. Over my 25-year career, I have slipped in a pool of blood and luged gusset first into the front row. I have been garrotted by scenery. I\u2019ve seen a game dame slowly roll down a raked stage after a fairy forgot to put the brakes on her bower. I have seen wonderful actors completely forget the plot and occasionally forget to come on altogether. It\u2019s surprisingly easy to filibuster in the style of Terence Rattigan, less so Shakespeare. I once whacked an actor over the head with a fan so hard that it snapped altogether. The two of us were unable to speak for laughing at the floppy prop. The audience saw what had happened, and there followed communal hysteria. It spread like a giggling Mexican wave. It was heaven. * * * First day of rehearsals for Scandaltown and, as per norm, everyone stands in a circle in the rehearsal room and says who they are and what they do. It\u2019s a bit first-day-of-school-y, but this time it feels different. Sixty theatre people in a room together feels like \u201ca statement of intent for the future of theatre\u201d, says Rachel O\u2019Riordan, and it does, it feels like an act of defiance. Our first-aider makes a gag about rashes, and everyone laughs. Meanwhile I am projectile crying at the sight of so many familiar faces in this same rehearsal room, two years on, without my Ma in the world. I manage to get away with it, just about, by making a lame joke about being really grateful to be employed. (This is also true.) I miss my ma more than words. I shall do this joyous job in her honour, and with her spirit by my side. I imagine what she would say to me before our first show. She would say to me what she always said to me before every show, she would say: \u201cGo fly, my girl.\u201d \u2022 Scandaltown is at Lyric Hammersmith, London W6 from 7 April to 14 May",

Barrett plays the situation for off-kilter laughs as well as peril; a similar left turn animates Anhedonia, Here I Come, about a self-regarding poet who, out to buy weed from his regular dealer (a camogie-playing schoolgirl about to go straight), finds himself propositioned by a fellow customer, a man carrying a baby girl in a sling.<br><br>The scenarios are richly layered, with punchy payoffs.

Where he truly excels is in his ability to condense the richness of family saga into just a couple of dozen pages, as in The 10, about a young car salesman, Danny, living in the shadow of his disappointment at being let go by Manchester United as a teenager. Probably the best football-related fiction since Ross Raisin\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/12/a-natural-review-ross-raisin-gay-footballer-masterful\">A Natural</a></em>, it deftly portrays the desires and disappointments of a range of characters in Danny\u2019s orbit, including the widowed sister of the girl he\u2019s seeing, and his older brother, left using a wheelchair since a childhood car accident.</p> <p>Barrett\u2019s opening lines tend to be are-you-sitting-comfortably? scene-setters: \u201cEileen watched the bus pull into the depot and the passengers debark, stiff and groggy, into the crisp November air, their breaths flashing like handkerchiefs in front of their faces.\u201d A more ambiguous note is struck by the openings to the equally excellent stories in Wendy Erskine\u2019s <em>Dance Move</em>, another follow-up to a celebrated debut collection (2019\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/27/sweet-home-by-wendy-erskine-review\">Sweet Home</a></em>). These Belfast tales set us wondering from the off about who, where, when and why. Try, for instance: \u201cIt actually only takes the taxi ten minutes to get there from the hotel.\u201d Or: \u201cEven on the morning of his wedding Lee texted her, because it was the allotted day\u201d \u2013 the start of a paragraph that can only be understood once we reread the story it introduces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"df2cb0da6b4272c380293f5821e3974f95b2d39a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df2cb0da6b4272c380293f5821e3974f95b2d39a/0_0_1378_1612/855.jpg\" alt=\"Wendy Erskine: \u2018daring, funny, heartbreaking\u2019\" width=\"855\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wendy Erskine: \u2018daring, funny, heartbreaking\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chad Alexander</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Relationships in these stories are often opaquely troubling: in Mathematics, a cleaner named Roberta shoplifts vital supplies to care for the small girl she discovers abandoned in one of the properties she cleans for her exploitative landlord. There\u2019s a great deal of sadness, not least in His Mother, about a woman removing the missing person posters she put up for her dead son, but there\u2019s also surreal comedy, even in the book\u2019s uglier moments: see Nostalgie, in which a faded English singer-songwriter who had a hit single in the 80s gets booked out of the blue for a private post-retirement gig driven, he discovers, by a paramilitary group\u2019s unlikely love for its B-side.</p> <p>Memento Mori, the most stunning piece here, brings everything in Erskine\u2019s formidable repertoire together for maximal impact. Her fondness for wrongfooting the reader gains force once it becomes clear where the protagonist, Gillian, shown taking mindfulness classes, actually is at the time of telling. The story turns on a doorstep killing that takes place with improbable timing right outside her home as she\u2019s caring for her terminally ill partner, Tracey; it\u2019s easily powerful enough on its own terms, yet there\u2019s an unmistakable satirical force, too, in how the story pits the imperatives of public commemoration against the needs of private grief. Daring, funny, heartbreaking and, like everything else here, out and out entertainment, not to be missed.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Homesickness</em> by Colin Barrett is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a314.99).

Try, for instance: \u201cIt actually only takes the taxi ten minutes to get there from the hotel.\u201d Or: \u201cEven on the morning of his wedding Lee texted her, because it was the allotted day\u201d \u2013 the start of a paragraph that can only be understood once we reread the story it introduces. Relationships in these stories are often opaquely troubling: in Mathematics, a cleaner named Roberta shoplifts vital supplies to care for the small girl she discovers abandoned in one of the properties she cleans for her exploitative landlord. There\u2019s a great deal of sadness, not least in His Mother, about a woman removing the missing person posters she put up for her dead son, but there\u2019s also surreal comedy, even in the book\u2019s uglier moments: see Nostalgie, in which a faded English singer-songwriter who had a hit single in the 80s gets booked out of the blue for a private post-retirement gig driven, he discovers, by a paramilitary group\u2019s unlikely love for its B-side. Memento Mori, the most stunning piece here, brings everything in Erskine\u2019s formidable repertoire together for maximal impact. Her fondness for wrongfooting the reader gains force once it becomes clear where the protagonist, Gillian, shown taking mindfulness classes, actually is at the time of telling. The story turns on a doorstep killing that takes place with improbable timing right outside her home as she\u2019s caring for her terminally ill partner, Tracey; it\u2019s easily powerful enough on its own terms, yet there\u2019s an unmistakable satirical force, too, in how the story pits the imperatives of public commemoration against the needs of private grief. Daring, funny, heartbreaking and, like everything else here, out and out entertainment, not to be missed. Homesickness by Colin Barrett is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a314.99).

But the idea is that all the artists in this gallery are doing the same thing, giving lasting life to nature\u2019s ephemeral blooms. <em>Ars longa, vita brevis</em>, whatever the era.</p> <p>The National Gallery has lent one of its greatest Dutch paintings for this show: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meindert_Hobbema\">Meindert Hobbema</a>\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/meindert-hobbema-the-avenue-at-middelharnis\">The Avenue at Middelharnis</a></em>.

Technology has always been Hockney\u2019s metier, from Polaroid, fax and photocopy to computer and iPad; it would be hard to think of another artist who has been more versatile with his media.

You can see one of these devices for projecting images onto paper in the Fitzwilliam show; and you can see Ingres\u2019s portraits alongside others by Hockney, in which he <a href=\"https://www.thedavidhockneyfoundation.org/chronology/2000\">deliberately uses </a>this device. The agility of <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/37225134406606612/\">Ingres\u2019s draughtsmanship</a> amazes, the line so lithe and spare in all its descriptive acuity; and it is the same with the Hockneys.</p> <p>But scepticism about the camera lucida theory \u2013 no such aid was found among Ingres\u2019s possessions, nobody mentions seeing him use one \u2013 has a pleasing corollary in the images themselves. Ingres is superbly consistent; Hockney is not. His drawings of Alan Bennett, Ian McKellen and other members of the national treasury are remarkably varied, ranging all the way from old master virtuosity to near cartoon. It is not the technology, nor even the eye, but the mind itself that determines the art.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6b018e77905361a58a724936867fba8cbd6f232d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b018e77905361a58a724936867fba8cbd6f232d/0_0_3952_2232/1000.jpg\" alt=\"After Hobbema (Useful Knowledge), 2017 David Hockney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"565\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">After Hobbema (Useful Knowledge), 2017. \u00a9 David Hockney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Schmidt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This point is beautifully made in a group of glass cases that includes <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/john-sell-cotman-116\">John Sell Cotman</a>\u2019s perspective drawings for teaching students at King\u2019s College London in the 1830s.

Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is the latest unwelcome shock to the UK economy. It will make people poorer. There is nothing we, the Bank, can do about it. So, over to you, Chancellor.</p> <p>Threadneedle Street is absolutely right. It doesn\u2019t have the tools to respond to rising global commodity prices but the Treasury does. Sunak has all sorts of ways of alleviating the pain: cutting taxes, increasing benefits, reducing excise duties, helping out with energy bills.</p> <p>And although the original intention was not to turn Wednesday\u2019s spring statement into a mini-budget, recent events mean that is what it needs to become. Unless Sunak wants to go down in history as the new Philip Snowden \u2013 the Labour chancellor who cut benefits during the Great Depression \u2013 he will need to come up with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/19/six-measures-rishi-sunak-could-take-to-combat-uks-cost-of-living-crisis\">something meaningful</a>.</p> <p>Sunak says he is \u201cdone\u201d with tax increases and has sympathy with people struggling to make ends meet. He needs to convert words into action because this is how things look. Inflationary pressure was growing even before Vladimir Putin decided to invade <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/19/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-24-of-the-invasion\">Ukraine,</a> because as the global economy started to emerge from lockdown the supply of basic commodities \u2013 such as oil \u2013 struggled to keep pace with demand.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/20/shadow-chancellor-calls-for-benefits-rise-to-fight-poverty\">Shadow chancellor calls for benefits rise to fight poverty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both companies and consumers are affected by rising inflation. Businesses that have to pay higher costs for fuel and raw materials have a choice: try to pass on the costs to their customers or take a hit on their profit margins.</p> <p>Consumers face a similar problem. If it costs more to fill up the car with petrol or heat their home, they can either try to secure pay increases that keep pace with inflation, cut spending on non-essential items, or rack up debt.</p> <p>It is not hard to see how things will play out in the coming months. Companies will initially seek to pass on their higher costs to their customers, but won\u2019t be able to make the price increases stick when consumers are belt-tightening.</p> <p>As any A-level student of economics knows, national output \u2013 or gross domestic product \u2013 is consumer spending plus investment plus government spending plus exports net of imports.</p> <p>Consumer spending is going to be weak this year because wages will fail to keep pace with prices. Companies are going to mothball investment as the costs of doing business go up. The chances of an export-led boom are nil given that every other energy-importing country faces exactly the same pressures as the UK.</p> <p>That leaves the government, where policy is currently the opposite of what it needs to be. Sunak has frozen <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/sunak-defends-tax-changes-as-a-fair-way-to-help-solve-the-problems-that-we-need-to-12235370\">tax allowances</a> for the rest of the parliament; he will raise employer and employee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/sep/07/boris-johnson-unveils-12bn-a-year-tax-rise-to-pay-for-nhs-and-social-care\">national insurance contributions</a> by 1.25 percentage points from next month; and he has temporarily scrapped the pensions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/sep/07/pensions-triple-lock-suspended-next-year-government-says\">triple lock</a>. Taken together, these measures will suck tens of billions of pounds out of the economy at precisely the wrong time.</p> <p>The Treasury has a dual function. It is primarily a ministry of finance with a ministry of the economy tacked on. During the early stages of the pandemic the finance ministry element took a rare back seat because there was an obvious need to spend money to prevent the economy collapsing during lockdown. Now that the pandemic is perceived to be over \u2013 even if there appears to be a sting in the tail \u2013 the Treasury has reverted to its normal way of working, with reducing public borrowing the main aim. That mindset needs to change.</p> <p>It is not as if Sunak hasn\u2019t been warned. The Bank of England was already forecasting the biggest squeeze on living standards since modern records began three decades ago, and says the impact of the invasion of Ukraine will make the situation \u201cmaterially\u2019 worse.</p> <p>Number crunching by the chartered accountant and political economist Richard Murphy suggests the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RichardJMurphy/status/1505102555742982148\">hit to living standards</a> will be extremely painful: a 14% hit for someone on the minimum wage, 11% for someone on median earnings.</p> <p>\u201cFor half UK households it\u2019s very hard to see how they have any chance of making ends meet without significant government support,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cThis is not just disastrous for them, it also signals that a recession is very likely unless Sunak takes action now. Delay would make it almost impossible to prevent a massive downturn happening.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to disagree with Murphy\u2019s conclusion. As things stand, Britain is heading for a monster recession and time is running out to take evasive action.</p> <p>It is clear that after fighting and winning a battle with Boris Johnson, Sunak is not going to scrap or even postpone the increase in NICs, even though going ahead with them now is an act of economic self-harm.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the chancellor dropped enough hints on his Sunday morning TV appearances to make it clear he will announce some additional help this week. Fuel duty looks certain to be slashed and there may be a temptation to shoot Labour\u2019s fox by announcing a temporary cut in VAT on domestic energy bills. Either measures would have the effect of increasing spending power and reducing the annual inflation rate.</p> <p>Sunak announced a package of support for households with their energy bills early last month and that already seems inadequate. The Treasury is, though, resistant to making it more generous until it is clear what will happen to the energy price cap when it is next revisited in October.</p> <p>That leaves state benefits, which are due to rise by 3.1% next month \u2013 about five percentage points below the likely rate of inflation. Raising benefits in line with the expected inflation rate would protect the most vulnerable and boost the economy. It would be costly but not as costly as doing nothing.</p>",

And although the original intention was not to turn Wednesday\u2019s spring statement into a mini-budget, recent events mean that is what it needs to become. Unless Sunak wants to go down in history as the new Philip Snowden \u2013 the Labour chancellor who cut benefits during the Great Depression \u2013 he will need to come up with something meaningful. Sunak says he is \u201cdone\u201d with tax increases and has sympathy with people struggling to make ends meet. He needs to convert words into action because this is how things look. Inflationary pressure was growing even before Vladimir Putin decided to invade Ukraine, because as the global economy started to emerge from lockdown the supply of basic commodities \u2013 such as oil \u2013 struggled to keep pace with demand. Both companies and consumers are affected by rising inflation. Businesses that have to pay higher costs for fuel and raw materials have a choice: try to pass on the costs to their customers or take a hit on their profit margins. Consumers face a similar problem. If it costs more to fill up the car with petrol or heat their home, they can either try to secure pay increases that keep pace with inflation, cut spending on non-essential items, or rack up debt. It is not hard to see how things will play out in the coming months. Companies will initially seek to pass on their higher costs to their customers, but won\u2019t be able to make the price increases stick when consumers are belt-tightening. As any A-level student of economics knows, national output \u2013 or gross domestic product \u2013 is consumer spending plus investment plus government spending plus exports net of imports. Consumer spending is going to be weak this year because wages will fail to keep pace with prices. Companies are going to mothball investment as the costs of doing business go up. The chances of an export-led boom are nil given that every other energy-importing country faces exactly the same pressures as the UK. That leaves the government, where policy is currently the opposite of what it needs to be. Sunak has frozen tax allowances for the rest of the parliament; he will raise employer and employee national insurance contributions by 1.25 percentage points from next month; and he has temporarily scrapped the pensions triple lock. Taken together, these measures will suck tens of billions of pounds out of the economy at precisely the wrong time. The Treasury has a dual function. It is primarily a ministry of finance with a ministry of the economy tacked on. During the early stages of the pandemic the finance ministry element took a rare back seat because there was an obvious need to spend money to prevent the economy collapsing during lockdown. Now that the pandemic is perceived to be over \u2013 even if there appears to be a sting in the tail \u2013 the Treasury has reverted to its normal way of working, with reducing public borrowing the main aim. That mindset needs to change. It is not as if Sunak hasn\u2019t been warned. The Bank of England was already forecasting the biggest squeeze on living standards since modern records began three decades ago, and says the impact of the invasion of Ukraine will make the situation \u201cmaterially\u2019 worse. Number crunching by the chartered accountant and political economist Richard Murphy suggests the hit to living standards will be extremely painful: a 14% hit for someone on the minimum wage, 11% for someone on median earnings. \u201cFor half UK households it\u2019s very hard to see how they have any chance of making ends meet without significant government support,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cThis is not just disastrous for them, it also signals that a recession is very likely unless Sunak takes action now. Delay would make it almost impossible to prevent a massive downturn happening.\u201d It\u2019s hard to disagree with Murphy\u2019s conclusion. As things stand, Britain is heading for a monster recession and time is running out to take evasive action. It is clear that after fighting and winning a battle with Boris Johnson, Sunak is not going to scrap or even postpone the increase in NICs, even though going ahead with them now is an act of economic self-harm. But the chancellor dropped enough hints on his Sunday morning TV appearances to make it clear he will announce some additional help this week. Fuel duty looks certain to be slashed and there may be a temptation to shoot Labour\u2019s fox by announcing a temporary cut in VAT on domestic energy bills. Either measures would have the effect of increasing spending power and reducing the annual inflation rate. Sunak announced a package of support for households with their energy bills early last month and that already seems inadequate. The Treasury is, though, resistant to making it more generous until it is clear what will happen to the energy price cap when it is next revisited in October. That leaves state benefits, which are due to rise by 3.1% next month \u2013 about five percentage points below the likely rate of inflation. Raising benefits in line with the expected inflation rate would protect the most vulnerable and boost the economy. It would be costly but not as costly as doing nothing.",

He had already fled prosecution once, escaping on foot from the US into Mexico in 2019. He had later<strong> </strong>been arrested in South Africa for illegally harvesting more than 2,000 rare succulents, including some more than a hundred years old. And<strong> </strong>while prosecutors could not prove that Kim had stolen succulents on his more than 50 previous trips to the US, they suspected, based on export records, that he might have taken upwards of 120,000 wild plants since 2013.</p> <p>Kim\u2019s crimes,<strong> </strong>the prosecutors argued, were motivated not by ignorance, but by \u201cinsatiable greed\u201d.</p> <h2>Farmer to fugitive</h2> <p>Law enforcement officials have little information about how Kim, a South Korean farmer who studied agriculture in college, ended up on the run from US agents. The details in court documents are sparse: he is separated from his wife and has two daughters, ages six and 16.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6c0af655f69a7633c8e02f12e119da5f0278d7a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c0af655f69a7633c8e02f12e119da5f0278d7a8/0_0_640_480/500.jpg\" alt=\"Dudleya succulent plants\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dudleya succulent plants, allegedly stolen by international poachers from remote cliffside locations along the northern California coast, recovered by the state department of fish and wildlife in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kim\u2019s American attorney, Jeremy Lessem, wrote in court documents that his client had hoped to use the plants he had taken from other countries to grow succulents on his own farm. Kim had grown up poor, Lessem wrote, and saw rare plants as a way to earn extra money \u201cthat he could use to pay for the education of his two girls\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHarvesting plants on public land in South Korea was often ignored or met with monetary fines,\u201d Lessem wrote.</p> <p>What is clear is that when Kim flew into LAX from Mexico in October 2018, he and his two assistants, Youngin Back and Bong Jun Kim, were fully on the radar of California\u2019s environmental cops.</p> <p>Game wardens of the state\u2019s fish and wildlife department observed Kim renting a minivan and filling it with empty backpacks, plastic bins and boxes. The three men later began a two-day drive up the California coast, according to court records.</p> <p>Wardens surveilled the trio for more than a week as they stealthily navigated around state parks on California\u2019s remote northern coast, filling their backpacks with dudleya, an<strong> </strong>attractive local succulent.</p> <p>The men dropped off their haul at the Secret Garden Nursery in Vista, California, then returned north for two days to dig up more succulents in Mendocino, this time communicating with handheld radios.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not hard to imagine a hillside denuded of dudleya that then sloughs off into the ocean because it doesn\u2019t have any plants to hold it there</p> <footer> <cite>Nick Jensen</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The wardens waited while Kim, who used the alias \u201cNeo\u201d, obtained documents to have the southern California nursery legally export 259 pounds of dudleya. He claimed that all the plants had originated in San Diego.</p> <p>They waited when the men transported dozens of plant boxes to an export facility in Compton.</p> <p>Then, as Kim and his companions prepared to drive away, the wardens made the arrests. The boxes Kim had tried to export contained more than 600 pounds of succulents, or 3,715 individual plants, more than double what the export documents described.</p> <h2>A perfect victim</h2> <p>California game wardens started going after plant thieves in 2018 after succulent thefts exploded in both California and the Western Cape of South Africa \u2013 regions with similar Mediterranean-style climates, which made them succulent poaching hotspots.</p> <p>The public response was \u201coverwhelmingly positive\u201d, said Captain Patrick Foy, a spokesman for California\u2019s fish and wildlife department. The reaction to poaching enforcement is sometimes negative, but when it came to succulents, \u201cpeople were furious\u201d, Foy said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7445deac4e36d9ca86f4bff58e48eb25d5c55930\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7445deac4e36d9ca86f4bff58e48eb25d5c55930/24_141_1996_2724/733.jpg\" alt=\"Dudleya farinosa growing on the Pacific coast bluffs in California.\" width=\"733\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dudleya farinosa growing on the Pacific coast bluffs in California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Reschke/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It probably helped that the plants being taken were popular, with widespread name recognition. Dudleya farinosa, the type of dudleya most sought after by California poachers, is particularly \u201ccharismatic\u201d to humans, experts say. They boast the precise mix of qualities that Americans demand from crime victims: they are pretty and small, very fragile and yet curiously resilient. Their common name, \u201cliveforevers\u201d, is said to have been given to them by 19th-century European naturalists, who were shocked to find samples of the plant still alive after months-long ocean voyages. Dudleya do not thrive in domestic captivity. \u201cTreat them like a petunia, and they\u2019ll be dead,\u201d said Stephen McCabe, a California succulent expert.</p> <p>The wardens found allies in California environmentalists, who passed along tips, identified poached plants and served as expert witnesses. While some dudleya are quite common,<strong> </strong>many species grow in only a few places, and some were already threatened by two of California\u2019s most persistent dangers: wildfire and luxury development, said McCabe.</p> <p>Plant advocates warned that some species of dudleya were so rare that, if they were targeted by poachers, they might go extinct, causing broader damage to entire ecosystems.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not hard to imagine a hillside denuded of dudleya that then sloughs off into the ocean because it doesn\u2019t have any plants to hold it there,\u201d said Nick Jensen, the conservation project manager at the California Native Plant Society.</p> <h2>\u2018A major smuggler\u2019</h2> <p>Kim and his assistants were charged with conspiracy and with violating a California law against destruction or removal of plant material on public land. Wardens estimated the stolen dudleya were worth $600,000 on the South Korean market.</p> <p>The California state charges were only the beginning. The US attorney\u2019s environmental crimes unit wanted to make an example out of the case. \u201cIn our view, a major smuggler who needed to be stopped,\u201d said Matthew O\u2019Brien, the assistant US attorney who prosecuted the federal case.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A dudleya farinosa from the wild bluffs of Mendocino, California, especially a five-headed one, is apparently a super cool thing to have</p> <footer> <cite>California game wardens</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In May 2019, when Kim learned about the federal charges, he fled. His passport had been confiscated, but Kim had gone to the South Korean embassy in Los Angeles, said he had lost his passport and been issued a new one. He crossed the border with Mexico on foot, and flew from there to China, then back to South Korea.</p> <p>Five months later, Kim re-emerged, this time on the other end of the globe. South African investigators caught him illegally harvesting more than 2,000 rare conophytum succulents, including one more than 250 years old and dozens more than a century old.</p> <p>Shortly after taking on the case, prosecutor Anne Heeramun received a call from an American fish and wildlife officer working as an embassy attache: her new suspect was already a fugitive from justice in the US.</p> <p>The South African prosecutors highlighted the \u201cseverity\u201d and \u201cbrutality\u201d of Kim\u2019s \u201ccrime against nature\u201d, and how stealing \u201clarge, ancient \u2018mother\u2019 plants\u201d put the entire species at risk, especially during times of serious drought.</p> <p>\u201cThe collection of these plants is an ecological tragedy,\u201d they wrote.</p> <h2>The real demand for smuggled plants</h2> <p>Kim pleaded guilty to the charges in South Africa and paid a large fine.<strong> </strong>After a year in South African prison, he was extradited to the US in October 2020.</p> <p>His case, like similar ones before it, drew significant media attention.

      "bodyText": "When Byungsu Kim appeared for his sentencing hearing on Zoom from the Santa Ana jail in California, his jaw was wired shut. The 46-year-old South Korean national had been in prison for more than two years on two different continents. According to the US government, he was an \u201cinternational succulent trafficker\u201d, perhaps the most notorious houseplant poacher in the world. Kim had already pleaded guilty to taking more than 3,700 wild dudleya plants from California state parks and attempting to export them to South Korea. \u201cAll these things happened because of my lack of knowledge,\u201d Kim now told the judge through a translator, according to Courthouse News, speaking with difficulty through his injured jaw, the result of an assault by another inmate. \u201cIf I had known a little bit more about America, if I had known a little bit more about the laws in America, I would not have done this stupid wrongdoing.\u201d The American prosecutors argued that Kim\u2019s claims of ignorance were ludicrous. He had already fled prosecution once, escaping on foot from the US into Mexico in 2019. He had later been arrested in South Africa for illegally harvesting more than 2,000 rare succulents, including some more than a hundred years old. And while prosecutors could not prove that Kim had stolen succulents on his more than 50 previous trips to the US, they suspected, based on export records, that he might have taken upwards of 120,000 wild plants since 2013. Kim\u2019s crimes, the prosecutors argued, were motivated not by ignorance, but by \u201cinsatiable greed\u201d. Farmer to fugitive Law enforcement officials have little information about how Kim, a South Korean farmer who studied agriculture in college, ended up on the run from US agents. The details in court documents are sparse: he is separated from his wife and has two daughters, ages six and 16. Kim\u2019s American attorney, Jeremy Lessem, wrote in court documents that his client had hoped to use the plants he had taken from other countries to grow succulents on his own farm. Kim had grown up poor, Lessem wrote, and saw rare plants as a way to earn extra money \u201cthat he could use to pay for the education of his two girls\u201d. \u201cHarvesting plants on public land in South Korea was often ignored or met with monetary fines,\u201d Lessem wrote. What is clear is that when Kim flew into LAX from Mexico in October 2018, he and his two assistants, Youngin Back and Bong Jun Kim, were fully on the radar of California\u2019s environmental cops. Game wardens of the state\u2019s fish and wildlife department observed Kim renting a minivan and filling it with empty backpacks, plastic bins and boxes. The three men later began a two-day drive up the California coast, according to court records. Wardens surveilled the trio for more than a week as they stealthily navigated around state parks on California\u2019s remote northern coast, filling their backpacks with dudleya, an attractive local succulent. The men dropped off their haul at the Secret Garden Nursery in Vista, California, then returned north for two days to dig up more succulents in Mendocino, this time communicating with handheld radios. The wardens waited while Kim, who used the alias \u201cNeo\u201d, obtained documents to have the southern California nursery legally export 259 pounds of dudleya. He claimed that all the plants had originated in San Diego. They waited when the men transported dozens of plant boxes to an export facility in Compton. Then, as Kim and his companions prepared to drive away, the wardens made the arrests. The boxes Kim had tried to export contained more than 600 pounds of succulents, or 3,715 individual plants, more than double what the export documents described. A perfect victim California game wardens started going after plant thieves in 2018 after succulent thefts exploded in both California and the Western Cape of South Africa \u2013 regions with similar Mediterranean-style climates, which made them succulent poaching hotspots. The public response was \u201coverwhelmingly positive\u201d, said Captain Patrick Foy, a spokesman for California\u2019s fish and wildlife department. The reaction to poaching enforcement is sometimes negative, but when it came to succulents, \u201cpeople were furious\u201d, Foy said. It probably helped that the plants being taken were popular, with widespread name recognition. Dudleya farinosa, the type of dudleya most sought after by California poachers, is particularly \u201ccharismatic\u201d to humans, experts say. They boast the precise mix of qualities that Americans demand from crime victims: they are pretty and small, very fragile and yet curiously resilient. Their common name, \u201cliveforevers\u201d, is said to have been given to them by 19th-century European naturalists, who were shocked to find samples of the plant still alive after months-long ocean voyages. Dudleya do not thrive in domestic captivity. \u201cTreat them like a petunia, and they\u2019ll be dead,\u201d said Stephen McCabe, a California succulent expert. The wardens found allies in California environmentalists, who passed along tips, identified poached plants and served as expert witnesses. While some dudleya are quite common, many species grow in only a few places, and some were already threatened by two of California\u2019s most persistent dangers: wildfire and luxury development, said McCabe. Plant advocates warned that some species of dudleya were so rare that, if they were targeted by poachers, they might go extinct, causing broader damage to entire ecosystems. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to imagine a hillside denuded of dudleya that then sloughs off into the ocean because it doesn\u2019t have any plants to hold it there,\u201d said Nick Jensen, the conservation project manager at the California Native Plant Society. \u2018A major smuggler\u2019 Kim and his assistants were charged with conspiracy and with violating a California law against destruction or removal of plant material on public land. Wardens estimated the stolen dudleya were worth $600,000 on the South Korean market. The California state charges were only the beginning. The US attorney\u2019s environmental crimes unit wanted to make an example out of the case. \u201cIn our view, a major smuggler who needed to be stopped,\u201d said Matthew O\u2019Brien, the assistant US attorney who prosecuted the federal case. In May 2019, when Kim learned about the federal charges, he fled. His passport had been confiscated, but Kim had gone to the South Korean embassy in Los Angeles, said he had lost his passport and been issued a new one. He crossed the border with Mexico on foot, and flew from there to China, then back to South Korea. Five months later, Kim re-emerged, this time on the other end of the globe. South African investigators caught him illegally harvesting more than 2,000 rare conophytum succulents, including one more than 250 years old and dozens more than a century old. Shortly after taking on the case, prosecutor Anne Heeramun received a call from an American fish and wildlife officer working as an embassy attache: her new suspect was already a fugitive from justice in the US. The South African prosecutors highlighted the \u201cseverity\u201d and \u201cbrutality\u201d of Kim\u2019s \u201ccrime against nature\u201d, and how stealing \u201clarge, ancient \u2018mother\u2019 plants\u201d put the entire species at risk, especially during times of serious drought. \u201cThe collection of these plants is an ecological tragedy,\u201d they wrote. The real demand for smuggled plants Kim pleaded guilty to the charges in South Africa and paid a large fine. After a year in South African prison, he was extradited to the US in October 2020. His case, like similar ones before it, drew significant media attention. Coverage of succulent smuggling often focused on the market demand for succulents in Asia, with experts pointing to the growing middle classes in South Korea and China, and the popularity of succulents as status-markers for hipsters and housewives. Wild plants had particular cachet in Asia, California game wardens suggested: \u201cIt\u2019s like having a Fendi bag on Rodeo Drive,\u201d one warden told a student journalist. \u201cA dudleya farinosa from the wild bluffs of Mendocino, California, especially a five-headed one, is apparently a super cool thing to have.\u201d Over the years, that narrative has been challenged. Early discussions about plant poaching had been full of \u201cstereotypes and tropes\u201d about an \u201cAsian super-consumer\u201d, motivated by vague \u201ceast Asian cultural traditional practices\u201d, said Jared Margulies, a political ecologist at the University of Alabama. But when Margulies investigated the market in Seoul, he found no dudleya for sale at the stores where \u201chipsters and housewives\u201d shopped for plants. There was also a botanical red flag: dudleya were finicky houseplants, likely to die quickly \u2013 an odd choice for the mass consumer. In fact, Margulies found, the reason dudleya were smuggled to South Korea was not because of local demand, but because of its high-end greenhouses, where rough wild dudleya could be pampered for a few years, growing larger and more lush, before being sold for elite prices on the global market. Many of the plants trafficked to South Korea probably ended up being resold elsewhere, Margulies concluded, to collectors in South Korea, China, Europe and the US. The case in Crescent City Margulies\u2019 research would have a major impact on Kim. As an expert witness in Kim\u2019s case, he reduced the government\u2019s estimate of the market value of Kim\u2019s wild succulent haul \u2013 from more than $600,000 to somewhere between $100,000 and $255,000. Federal sentencing guidelines closely track the value of stolen goods. US prosecutors asked that Kim be sentenced to three years in prison as a deterrent to other smugglers. Lessem, Kim\u2019s attorney, argued that he had suffered enough. He had contracted Covid-19 in prison, Lessem said, and lived in fear of contracting it again. His assault by another inmate, which left him with his jaw wired shut, was part of the toll of being imprisoned in a country where he did not speak the language. Expressing some agreement with Lessem\u2019s arguments, the judge sentenced Kim to two years, at the lower end of the guideline. The Bureau of Prisons further credited Kim\u2019s prison time in South Africa towards his sentence, a justice department spokesperson said. But that did not mean that Kim was released. Instead, his federal time served, Kim was transported in late January to the custody of the Del Norte county sheriff, in Crescent City, a remote northern California town of about 6,000 people. Kim is now facing two additional cases in state court, one for his original succulent thefts, and one for fleeing the country during that prosecution, according to his new attorney, Joseph Futrell, who said neither he nor his client would comment. In California, dudleya smuggling has dramatically reduced in recent years, but South Africa has seen a new surge in \u201cfloral matters\u201d, Heeramun said. This time, it\u2019s locals facing prison time. Foreigners are still driving the succulent trade, she said, but they have responded to prosecution by \u201cusing locals to do the gathering and the picking\u201d. One way to prevent the poaching of rare plants is simply to cultivate as many of the coveted plants as possible, thus reducing the market value of stolen plants. But environmental activists also continue to endorse tough criminal punishments. In 2021, the California Native Plant Society helped pass a state law specifically criminalizing dudleya poaching, with fines of up to $500,000 and six months in prison. \u201cIt\u2019s very sad if people are compelled to come to California, or anywhere, and remove a wild organism from its natural habitat, and they end up in jail,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a sad story all the way around that I\u2019m concerned, for the plant and the people.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>There is a fascinating tension in the British attitude to war and military matters. When he wrote about <a href=\"https://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/lion/english/e_eye\">England in 1941</a>, George Orwell said his home country was defined by the \u201cgentleness\u201d of its civilisation, and such a \u201chatred of war and militarism\u201d that flag-waving and patriotic boasting were always the preserve of a small minority. Events over the past 40 or so years have perhaps proved him wrong: from time to time, a widely shared jingoism has been brought to the surface of our national life, focused either on actual conflict \u2013 as happened when Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/13/our-boys-by-helen-parr-review-falklands\">fought for the Falkland Islands</a> \u2013 or some hare-brained proxy for it, such as Brexit. But there is something about Orwell\u2019s portrayal of people with an innate distaste for bellicose posturing that still rings true, across all the countries of the United Kingdom.</p> \n<p>Among certain politicians, by contrast, there is far too little of that kind of thinking. Over the past three weeks, the unimaginable awfulness of what has happened in Ukraine and the fact that Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion is such a matter of moral clarity has encouraged a lot of rhetoric and posturing that has been shrill, banal and full of a misplaced machismo. The war, <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/ukraine-isn-t-boris-s-falklands-moment-\">says one Tory MP</a>, is Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cFalklands moment\u201d. The vocal Conservative backbencher Tobias Ellwood \u2013 a former soldier in the Royal Green Jackets, and now an active reservist \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk-politics/2022/02/tobias-ellwood-the-uk-must-support-a-no-fly-zone-over-ukraine\">insists</a> that the west\u2019s response shows \u201cwe\u2019ve lost our appetite, we\u2019ve lost our confidence to stand up: to stand tall\u201d. And while he and other Tory MPs \u2013 including zealous believers in Britain breaking from the EU, suddenly holding forth about the urgent need for international unity \u2013 have been making <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/davis-ellwood-nato-russia-ukraine-b2022259.html\">sense-defying demands</a> for Nato to impose a no-fly zone, some of the cabinet have come out with their own very unsettling pronouncements, seemingly thinking that if Putin talks tough, they should talk tougher. When Sajid Javid was asked about the recent Russian attack on a Ukrainian military base only about 10 miles from the country\u2019s border with Poland, we saw the strange spectacle of the health secretary <a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/nato-will-be-at-war-with-russia-sajid-javid/\">apparently embracing</a> the prospect of nuclear war: \u201cLet\u2019s be very clear \u2026 if a single Russian toecap steps into Nato territory, there will be war with Nato.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/20/rishi-sunak-spring-statement-cost-of-living-crisis\">Rishi Sunak\u2019s charm won\u2019t save him if he is seen to fiddle while Britons\u2019 pockets burn | Andrew Rawnsley</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>With the chancellor Rishi Sunak\u2019s spring statement arriving on Wednesday, a familiar sound is getting louder: Conservatives demanding more money for the military, even though the UK <a href=\"https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/uk-ranked-fifth-largest-defence-spender/\">currently spends</a> the fifth-largest annual sum in the world (after the US, China, India and Russia). For well over a decade now, most Tories have been united in the belief that just about every public service is best cut to the bone and subjected to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/oct/04/george-osborne-speech-conservative-conference\">endless lectures </a>about inefficiency. But defence is suddenly a glaring exception: Labour may have <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-59876757\">credibly identified</a> \u00a313bn of departmental waste since 2010, but that seems to be no barrier to calls for a <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10582973/Boris-Johnson-pressure-defence-spending-wake-Ukraine-war.html\">spending rise</a> of about 25%. </p> \n<p>If you want a flavour of the thinking at work, a good place to start is a <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/03/05/uk-must-learn-hard-lessons-shattering-wests-illusions/\">recent piece</a> in the Sunday Telegraph by the former Brexit minister David Frost. He reckons that \u201cwestern muscle memory is returning and we are getting back to the principles that helped us to win the cold war\u201d. He says: \u201cWe are going to have to spend more on defence and that will mean tough choices.\u201d We all know what those are likely to be: the price of our supposedly central role in a reshaped world may well be paid in social care, education, children\u2019s services and all the rest.</p> \n<p>Though he would presumably express opposition to cuts elsewhere, Keir Starmer has <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/keir-starmer-calls-rishi-sunak-26451273\">joined in the calls</a> for more military cash, which snugly fits the \u201cI\u2019m not Jeremy Corbyn\u201d narrative of his leadership. Given Starmer\u2019s apparent determination to follow the example set by his New Labour forebears, and Tony Blair\u2019s recent offer to help his old party with policy advice, we should be listening hard to what the latter has to say. Last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/mar/15/boris-johnson-russian-oil-gas-energy-prices-ukraine-uk-politics-latest-updates#block-6230b6b78f0810b64b1b54fe\">he published an essay</a> about the Ukraine crisis. Its most sobering passage ran thus: \u201cWhen Putin is threatening Nato and stoking fear of nuclear conflict, there is something incongruous about our repeated assurance to him that we will not react with force.\u201d Naturally enough, Blair also wants more money for the armed forces. \u201cWe are awake,\u201d he says. \u201cNow we must act.\u201d This the same register he used <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/oct/02/labourconference.labour7\">at the start of the \u201cwar on terror\u201d</a>, when he talked about shaken kaleidoscopes and the need to \u201creorder this world around us\u201d. Hearing it again is not exactly reassuring.</p> \n<p>As is usually the case, Boris Johnson\u2019s tone swings between the serious and utterly crass. At this weekend\u2019s Tory spring conference, he and his colleagues parroted the familiar argument that the war demands an end to \u201cwoke\u201d ideas and criticisms of British history (which actually sounds like a milquetoast version of Putinism), and he made that grotesque comparison of Ukrainians to Brexit voters. When caught in a more sensible mood, he has also counselled a measure of caution and level-headedness. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that we don\u2019t get locked into any kind of logic of direct conflict between the west and Russia because that\u2019s how Putin wants to portray it \u2026 as a fight between him and Nato,\u201d he told the Economist last week. \u201cIt isn\u2019t. This is about the Ukrainian people and their right to defend themselves.\u201d This line <a href=\"https://www.thenational.scot/news/national/20006582.johnson-calls-china-speak-ukraine-war/\">was repeated on Sunday</a>. But around him, there still swirl very dangerous currents.<strong> </strong></p> \n<p>Back in the 1980s, as Ronald Reagan speculated about a <a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/10/20/President-Reagans-remarks-about-a-possible-limited-nuclear-conflict/7313372398400/\">limited nuclear war in Europe</a> and we were warned about the prospect of an accidental nuclear exchange, I grew up with a cold sense of fear. Now a new generation has to face not just those same anxieties, but the existential threat of the climate emergency and the prospect of regular global pandemics. Not surprisingly, there is a growing crisis in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/11/teachers-buckling-under-strain-of-pupils-mental-health-crisis\">childhood mental health</a>: a sign not just of failing public services, but arguably of a system of power and politics that does not ease such visceral fears, instead endlessly inflaming them.</p> \n<p>In a situation as fragile as this, belligerent talk can have terrifying consequences. It also tends to highlight the way Westminster\u2019s armchair generals neglect their duty of care to their own citizens. I am now having conversations with my 12-year-old daughter about the prospect of nuclear annihilation. I tell her it\u2019ll be all right, but her \u2013 and my \u2013 fears are hardly helped by the reckless words we sporadically hear from some of those supposedly in charge.</p> \n<p>Yes, the world has clearly changed. Even if liberal values are always damaged and compromised by people in power, that does not mean that they are not still the best hope we have, something Putin\u2019s passage into something <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2022/mar/17/scum-and-traitors-putin-threatens-russians-who-oppose-war-in-ukraine-video\">close to fascism </a>makes plain. But those same values \u2013 not to mention the delicate stuff of geopolitics and diplomacy \u2013 demand nuance and calm. Moreover, there is one thing we overlook at our peril: that however much we spend on our military, our social fabric needs to be resilient and secure enough to cope with a new reality of constant shocks and disruptions, and at the moment it is anything but. In this dreadful moment, these seem to be things in danger of being forgotten. I worry about that. I think we all should.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>John Harris is a Guardian columnist.

      "bodyText": "Pandemic restrictions are being lifted with alacrity across Europe despite many countries experiencing a record surge in coronavirus cases and concerns about the failure to vaccinate many people considered vulnerable to the disease. In Germany most pandemic controls will be lifted on Sunday after a heated parliamentary debate on Friday which led to both houses of parliament voting in favour. That was despite cases in Germany reaching a new daily record of almost 300,000 on Friday \u2013 a seven-day incidence rate of 1,706 cases per 100,000 residents \u2013 and a majority of the population expressing concern that the relaxations were coming too soon. Germany has been recording daily deaths of over 200 for several weeks. Cases are also climbing in Austria, the Netherlands, Switzerland and France. In Austria authorities said they had little choice other than to reintroduce a face mask mandate for indoor spaces in the light of a hefty rise in cases to 3,600 per 100,000 inhabitants. The health minister, Johannes Rauch, announced on Friday that from the middle of this week medical FFP2 masks will have to be worn again. Austria is at the same time considering reducing quarantine times due to an acute lack of nurses and other hospital staff as infections rise, leading to operations having to be postponed and a record number of resignations among medical staff.

What schoolchildren eat for lunch has become a litmus test for how we are doing as a country. In April last year, Aberdeenshire council was forced to <a href=\"https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/aberdeen-aberdeenshire/3053494/school-pupils-call-for-best-puddings-in-the-world-to-be-put-back-on-school-menu-after-council-axes-ice-cream-and-custard/\" title=\"\">stop serving grapes</a> as part of an overall bid to save more than \u00a320m. Slicing them was deemed too labour intensive and expensive. (When the council cut custard and ice-cream in keeping with new guidelines curbing sugar intake, two 11-year-old pupils successfully petitioned for <a href=\"https://www.grampianonline.co.uk/news/petition-power-puts-puddings-back-on-the-primary-school-menu-249075/\" title=\"\">their return</a>.) Five months later, Lancashire county council announced its school <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-lancashire-58753203\" title=\"\">menus would be temporarily reduced</a>, with only jacket potatoes, soups and sandwiches on offer because of a shortage of lorry drivers. If school dinners are a commentary on the state of the nation, then the same societal issues \u2013 inequality, austerity,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/dec/22/deprived-children-summer-scheme-dfe-free-school-meals\" title=\"\"> the pandemic</a> \u2013 are often reflected in our canteens.</p> <p>School dinners can also serve another, less recognised function. From my own experience and speaking with my family members and others from migrant backgrounds, a common perspective emerges. School dinners were our gateway to traditional British food and, in some ways, the wider culture. Memories are often fond. \u201cSo many good things to say,\u201d says my uncle Nahid. \u201cEveryone from my school will remember the name of the cook, Mrs MacIlroy. Her desserts were the best; the chocolate pudding with chocolate custard \u2013 just genius.\u201d</p> <p>The care and affection that came with mealtimes is remembered as much as the food. \u201cShe\u2019d always go around the tables to see if the kids were enjoying the food. And it was back in the day when the kitchen ladies would prepare portions of eight, so each table would get their own serving to be dished out.\u201d</p> <p>My mother, a child of Bangladeshi migrants in Manchester in the 1970s, also remembers her school cook. \u201cMrs Lamb. Her mash was the best. And the cheese flan, cheese and tomato tart, and cheese pie.\u201d The dairy-heavy memories are no accident; schools did not yet provide halal meals for Muslim students, so the savouries revolved around cheese and fish. And for afters? \u201cThe puddings were next level. My all-time favourite was peach tart with milky coffee,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Serving coffee to primary schoolchildren feels distinctly of the era, as does the well-intentioned attempt to diversify the menu. School curry plagued all kids but especially the ones who regularly ate the real deal at home and couldn\u2019t fathom what was on offer. \u201cThe Asian kids were totally grossed out by the apple and sultanas in the curry,\u201d remembers my mum, \u201cand the overpowering smell of madras curry powder.\u201d</p> <p>School dinners were at their best when they focused on the cooks\u2019 strengths: pies, puddings, roasts, homemade custard. For many, these dishes were an introduction to aspects of British life and were not just for children. My father arrived in Britain in 1983, shortly after marrying my mother. He left his job as a university lecturer in Bangladesh to become a secondary school teacher in a small West Yorkshire town. Amid the hardships of career change \u2013 notably the lack of discipline and respect among his students and the loss of teaching his beloved Bengali literature \u2013 came the unexpected delight of discovering English cuisine via the school dining hall.</p> <p>Steamed syrup sponge with thick yellow custard, apple pie, cheese and onion savouries all joined my father\u2019s list of favourites. Sometimes he would come home and describe something exotic he ate that day and my sisters and I would make it at home \u2013 cheesy baked leeks, puffy Yorkshire puddings, creamy fisherman\u2019s pie. In time, his affection for these dishes and our own studying of cookbooks meant that we were able to recreate \u201ctraditional\u201d Sunday roast dinners at home, albeit with a chicken smothered in tandoori powder and turmeric, and bake crumbles and cakes \u2013 even if we cheated by using Bird\u2019s powder for the custard.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>School dinners were at their best when they focused on the cooks\u2019 strengths: pies, puddings, roasts, homemade custard</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By the 1990s, the provision of school meals was outsourced to private catering firms, with education authorities under pressure to choose the most \u201ccompetitive\u201d provider. Menus had broadened to include vegetarian and halal options, as well as takes on \u201cEuropean\u201d offerings that had made their mark on the mainstream British appetite: lasagne, pizza, pasta.</p> <p>Like others of my generation, I remember floppy, cheesy pizzas with pools of grease on top, jelly with fruit in and a squirt of whipped cream, wilted fish fingers and mounds of pale yellow chips. We didn\u2019t eat much pasta or lasagne at home so the novelty certainly contributed to one of my earliest childhood ambitions, which was to become a dinner lady. I imagined myself clanging metal trays of food around, doling out portions to hungry kids and having seconds whenever I wanted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"33eb5f62624f44a9d5151194d9d51e5c440ea661\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33eb5f62624f44a9d5151194d9d51e5c440ea661/0_216_5464_6827/800.jpg\" alt=\"School Puddings \" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Chocolate puddings with custard \u2013 genius.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ellis Parrinder/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That nostalgia isn\u2019t unique to me. The <a href=\"https://www.mylahore.co.uk/\" title=\"\">MyLahore restaurant chain</a>, founded in Bradford, offers a blend of Pakistani and British classic dishes, \u201ceverything from samosas to shepherd\u2019s pie, and karahis to <a href=\"https://ranges.mylahore.co.uk/collections/desserts/products/old-school-puddings-box\" title=\"\">cornflake tarts</a>\u201d, according to its menu. It has clearly struck a chord with generations of British Asians, with the chain expanding to Manchester, Birmingham and London during the past five years. \u201cWhen we first opened MyLahore it was a traditional, normal curry house,\u201d says 35-year-old Ishfaq Farooq, the director of the family-run chain.</p> <p>The menu expansion was a result of his younger sister\u2019s innovation. She made an apple crumble at home one day and her brothers took it to the cafe to serve to customers. It was so popular that they asked her to make another. As she was still studying at the time, she asked her school dinner lady for a recipe and researched others in books she borrowed from the library, adding cornflake tart, jam roly-poly, chocolate cake and chocolate custard to her repertoire. The menu at the family restaurant was changed for ever.</p> <p>That was more than 15 years ago. Now the menu has a section devoted to \u201cold school puddings\u201d, including jam coconut sponge, apple crumble and sticky toffee pudding. \u201cThese were dishes we looked up to,\u201d explains Farooq. \u201cWe usually went home for dinner, we couldn\u2019t afford school dinners, but when we could have them, it was something really special.\u201d</p> <p>Buoyed by their success, the MyLahore team expanded into other school dinner classics of lasagne and pasta \u2013 but \u201cwith an Asian twist\u201d, says Farooq. \u201cThis is how typical Asian families would make these dishes at home \u2013 it\u2019s not the Italian way.\u201d Green chillies abound, the mince is spicy, and the result is delicious.</p> <p>Farooq is proud of his food. \u201cWe\u2019ve always tried to showcase the British-Asian story. We always say we are British-Asian because that is who we are. And we look for opportunities to give back to the community.\u201d</p> <p>As well as <a href=\"https://www.easterneye.biz/asian-eateries-find-innovative-ways-to-engage-with-communities-during-pandemic/\" title=\"\">donating meals</a> to local care homes, food banks and key workers during Covid lockdowns, when the government was dragging its feet over school meal provision, MyLahore stepped in to ensure local pupils got at least one hot meal a day. Farooq says \u201cit felt natural\u201d that the restaurant chain stepped up. \u201cOur parents and grandparents came to this country, and they worked hard.\u201d</p> <p>The continuing significance of school meals in our public consciousness is about more than just food; it\u2019s an expression of care, of how much children and their wellbeing matters, and a reflection of not just the tastes, but the cultures and traditions that make up Britain today. <br><br><em>Shahnaz Ahsan is the author of Hashim &amp; Family (John Murray, \u00a38.99).

Serving coffee to primary schoolchildren feels distinctly of the era, as does the well-intentioned attempt to diversify the menu. School curry plagued all kids but especially the ones who regularly ate the real deal at home and couldn\u2019t fathom what was on offer. \u201cThe Asian kids were totally grossed out by the apple and sultanas in the curry,\u201d remembers my mum, \u201cand the overpowering smell of madras curry powder.\u201d School dinners were at their best when they focused on the cooks\u2019 strengths: pies, puddings, roasts, homemade custard. For many, these dishes were an introduction to aspects of British life and were not just for children. My father arrived in Britain in 1983, shortly after marrying my mother. He left his job as a university lecturer in Bangladesh to become a secondary school teacher in a small West Yorkshire town. Amid the hardships of career change \u2013 notably the lack of discipline and respect among his students and the loss of teaching his beloved Bengali literature \u2013 came the unexpected delight of discovering English cuisine via the school dining hall. Steamed syrup sponge with thick yellow custard, apple pie, cheese and onion savouries all joined my father\u2019s list of favourites. Sometimes he would come home and describe something exotic he ate that day and my sisters and I would make it at home \u2013 cheesy baked leeks, puffy Yorkshire puddings, creamy fisherman\u2019s pie. In time, his affection for these dishes and our own studying of cookbooks meant that we were able to recreate \u201ctraditional\u201d Sunday roast dinners at home, albeit with a chicken smothered in tandoori powder and turmeric, and bake crumbles and cakes \u2013 even if we cheated by using Bird\u2019s powder for the custard. By the 1990s, the provision of school meals was outsourced to private catering firms, with education authorities under pressure to choose the most \u201ccompetitive\u201d provider. Menus had broadened to include vegetarian and halal options, as well as takes on \u201cEuropean\u201d offerings that had made their mark on the mainstream British appetite: lasagne, pizza, pasta. Like others of my generation, I remember floppy, cheesy pizzas with pools of grease on top, jelly with fruit in and a squirt of whipped cream, wilted fish fingers and mounds of pale yellow chips. We didn\u2019t eat much pasta or lasagne at home so the novelty certainly contributed to one of my earliest childhood ambitions, which was to become a dinner lady. I imagined myself clanging metal trays of food around, doling out portions to hungry kids and having seconds whenever I wanted. That nostalgia isn\u2019t unique to me. The MyLahore restaurant chain, founded in Bradford, offers a blend of Pakistani and British classic dishes, \u201ceverything from samosas to shepherd\u2019s pie, and karahis to cornflake tarts\u201d, according to its menu. It has clearly struck a chord with generations of British Asians, with the chain expanding to Manchester, Birmingham and London during the past five years. \u201cWhen we first opened MyLahore it was a traditional, normal curry house,\u201d says 35-year-old Ishfaq Farooq, the director of the family-run chain. The menu expansion was a result of his younger sister\u2019s innovation. She made an apple crumble at home one day and her brothers took it to the cafe to serve to customers. It was so popular that they asked her to make another. As she was still studying at the time, she asked her school dinner lady for a recipe and researched others in books she borrowed from the library, adding cornflake tart, jam roly-poly, chocolate cake and chocolate custard to her repertoire. The menu at the family restaurant was changed for ever. That was more than 15 years ago. Now the menu has a section devoted to \u201cold school puddings\u201d, including jam coconut sponge, apple crumble and sticky toffee pudding. \u201cThese were dishes we looked up to,\u201d explains Farooq. \u201cWe usually went home for dinner, we couldn\u2019t afford school dinners, but when we could have them, it was something really special.\u201d Buoyed by their success, the MyLahore team expanded into other school dinner classics of lasagne and pasta \u2013 but \u201cwith an Asian twist\u201d, says Farooq. \u201cThis is how typical Asian families would make these dishes at home \u2013 it\u2019s not the Italian way.\u201d Green chillies abound, the mince is spicy, and the result is delicious. Farooq is proud of his food. \u201cWe\u2019ve always tried to showcase the British-Asian story. We always say we are British-Asian because that is who we are. And we look for opportunities to give back to the community.\u201d As well as donating meals to local care homes, food banks and key workers during Covid lockdowns, when the government was dragging its feet over school meal provision, MyLahore stepped in to ensure local pupils got at least one hot meal a day. Farooq says \u201cit felt natural\u201d that the restaurant chain stepped up. \u201cOur parents and grandparents came to this country, and they worked hard.\u201d The continuing significance of school meals in our public consciousness is about more than just food; it\u2019s an expression of care, of how much children and their wellbeing matters, and a reflection of not just the tastes, but the cultures and traditions that make up Britain today.

      "body": "<p>You can imagine how the prospect of turning 40 was particularly problematic for Simon Amstell. The film-maker and comedian, who started as a stand-up at 13 and was presenter of the cultish <em>Popworld</em> at 21, has always projected brilliant boyishness. When the dread birthday approached in 2019, he responded, he says, in entirely cliched fashion: he dyed his trademark mop of black curly hair blond and ran away to New York for a last-ditch adventure. When that didn\u2019t work he resorted to the only thing that had properly helped him with depression in his 20s: he returned to Peru, where he had once taken the plant-based hallucinogen ayahuasca. There, over the course of a 10-day series of shamanic ceremonies in the rainforest, he found the answer to his anxieties.</p> <p>What happened?</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d he says, frequently punctuating his account with his wickedly high-pitched laugh, \u201cduring this one particular ceremony, I found that I excavated all the shame I\u2019ve been carrying in my body by taking off all my clothes \u2013 unexpectedly. And then my finger, beyond my control, made its way towards my perineum [that generally unexplored no man\u2019s land between anus and scrotum]. I had,\u201d he recalls, with remembered delight, \u201ca vision of the perineum becoming a new hole that you could enter. And when I poked my finger in, I started making loud orgasm sounds. I thought I could get away with it, because everyone else in the circle was having their own experience \u2013 crying and throwing up and so on \u2013 but eventually, near the end of the ceremony, everyone else was pretty much done. The chanting had all stopped. And the only sound was me having an orgasm.\u201d</p> <p>He giggles at the memory. \u201cThe question I was being asked by the medicine was,\u201d he says, \u201cwhat is more important to you: shame or pleasure? I leaned deeply into the shame \u2013 and chose the pleasure.\u201d</p> <p>Amstell is recounting this story in the back corner of The Sun and 13 Cantons, a pub in London\u2019s Soho, which is hosting his favourite vegan kitchen, Tendril, as a pop-up. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/17/help-simon-amstell-recovery-freedom-from-addictions-russell-brand-reviews\" title=\"\">his 2017 memoir </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/17/help-simon-amstell-recovery-freedom-from-addictions-russell-brand-reviews\" title=\"\">Help</a></em> revealed, he long ago developed a high-risk strategy for staying sane: he would expose all his deepest fears on stage, the place he always felt safest, and trust that people might laugh. The ayahuasca ceremony forms the basis of his latest standup tour, which was interrupted by the pandemic but will resume in May.</p> <p>Did what happened in Peru make equal sense back in London?</p> <p>\u201cI arrived home with this feeling of tremendous excitement about the future,\u201d he recalls. \u201cAnd then, because of lockdown, the future paused. Luckily, somebody I met on the retreat was able to send me magic mushrooms. And so the healing was able to continue.\u201d</p> <p>Did it not seem quite an extreme strategy against midlife fears?</p> <p>\u201cI certainly didn\u2019t see it that way. The really big risk to me was remaining depressed,\u201d he says. He is confident the darkness is now behind him. One lasting habit is the need to dance every morning when he wakes up. \u201cI\u2019ve found it\u2019s quite difficult to retain depression if you\u2019re jumping around every morning like a lunatic.\u201d</p> <p>The burst of creative looseness has been useful in different ways. Amstell has written two film scripts in the past couple of years, the first of which will go into production in September. \u201cI realised during this pandemic that I love writing because it actually allows me to be somewhere else. I got to be in Miami losing my virginity, which was great.\u201d</p> <p>Those scripts follow on from Amstell\u2019s two previous films which, in different ways, showed he was far more than the wisecracking host of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/may/26/never-mind-the-buzzcocks-top-moments-bbc\">Never Mind the Buzzcocks</a></em>, the role he perhaps remains best known for. The most recent of his movies, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/16/benajmin-review-simon-amstell-colin-morgan\" title=\"\">Benjamin</a></em>, was a tender, clever romcom in which a cripplingly awkward alter ego, played by Colin Morgan, gets eventually to find love. The other, <em>Carnage</em>, made for the BBC in 2017, employed perfectly pitched Chris Morris-style satire to examine the systemic cruelties of our diet. <em>Carnage</em> is set in the year 2067 and features a cast of older characters in group therapy as they try to come to terms with their horrific carnivorous pasts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cecdb54a59b62dc20efa6d47da845aa16670abe7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cecdb54a59b62dc20efa6d47da845aa16670abe7/272_904_4646_2787/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lunch With Simon Amstell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Simon and Tim shared </strong><em>Smoked aubergine, tahini, chilli cucumber, puff pastry \u00a35, jerusalem artichoke, cracker, chive, wakame \u00a35, tostada, muhamarra, winter squash, chard kimchi \u00a37.50, \u201cChinatown\u201d purple potatoes, sticky soy, sesame cracker \u00a37.50, roasted cauliflower, pickled lime, moilee, black rice \u00a38, chocolate tiramisu \u00a36.<br></em><strong>Simon and Tim both drank </strong><em>Tap water</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With our table suitably crowded with fabulous plates of smoked aubergine, and celeriac terrine and roasted cauliflower from Tendril\u2019s kitchen, he evangelises his own journey to that particular awakening.

Happily, that is another aspect of Amstell\u2019s life that appears to have evolved. For a long time, his father refused to watch him perform, saying it \u201cwasn\u2019t his thing\u201d, but he did come along to the Palladium on the current tour. \u201cHe hadn\u2019t been to see me for maybe seven or eight years,\u201d says Amstell. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he laughed, but he seemed very happy and proud afterwards.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I excavated all the shame I\u2019ve been carrying by taking off my clothes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The onstage therapy appears to have worked in surprising ways. \u201cI think what changes is your perspective on the other person,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re feeling rage towards someone, it\u2019s quite difficult to have a nice time.

And the actual thought in my head was: \u2018Everyone here is going to age and die.\u2019\u201d He laughs. \u201cWhat was wrong with me? Well, depression, I guess.\u201d</p> <p>If his experience in Peru has taught him anything, he says, it\u2019s that life can also be lived in the affirmative. His film <em>Benjamin</em> was supposed to end with his character unable to commit to a future with his lover \u2013 but in the final scene the actor took over, and said \u201cyes\u201d where Amstell\u2019s script had left him hanging. In the editing room he feared the payoff might be too cheesy but was persuaded to go with it. The fact is, he suggests, \u201cwe have these voices telling us that what is most true is the miserable part of our lives \u2013 but dancing around and having a nice time can be just as real\u201d. </p> <p><em>Simon Amstell is on tour from <a href=\"https://www.simonamstell.com/spirit-hole-dates-1\" title=\"\">5 May</a></em></p>",

Well, depression, I guess.\u201d If his experience in Peru has taught him anything, he says, it\u2019s that life can also be lived in the affirmative. His film Benjamin was supposed to end with his character unable to commit to a future with his lover \u2013 but in the final scene the actor took over, and said \u201cyes\u201d where Amstell\u2019s script had left him hanging. In the editing room he feared the payoff might be too cheesy but was persuaded to go with it. The fact is, he suggests, \u201cwe have these voices telling us that what is most true is the miserable part of our lives \u2013 but dancing around and having a nice time can be just as real\u201d. Simon Amstell is on tour from 5 May",

While Britain\u2019s response to the refugee crisis in Ukraine has been heavily criticised, it is now widely acknowledged in the world\u2019s defence ministries to have played a leading role in arming Ukrainian troops with the most effective weapons, as well as training.</p> <p>\u201cWe can criticise British foreign policy at times, but we actually led,\u201d said Professor Sir Lawrence Freedman, emeritus professor of war studies, King\u2019s College London. \u201cThere has been very close cooperation with the Ukrainians for a while, so there was a good idea of what they\u2019d need, but it also had a good anti-tank weapon to send them.

Britain\u2019s involvement in training troops dates back to Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014. In the face of some opposition within Whitehall, British military help for Ukraine was conducted through Operation Orbital from 2015.</p> <p>Ukraine\u2019s former president Petro Poroshenko has said that he inherited a decrepit armed forces when he came to power in 2014, which was transformed by western aid. About 22,000 Ukrainian troops have been trained through the programme.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the NLAWs have been very effective, with some sources reporting an extraordinary 90% hit rate. The weapons, which can be swiftly deployed at close quarters and discarded, are lighter than the similar Javelin anti-tank missile systems, which the US has been dispatching to Ukraine. So far, Britain has sent more than 4,200 NLAWs.</p> <p>However, while the supply of the weapons and past training from Britain have helped, military experts warn that there simply <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/grisly-urban-warfare-looms-unless-west-beefs-up-ukraine-arms-supply-russia\" title=\"\">has not been time </a>to help Ukraine with the more sophisticated training and weapons systems required for countering a full invasion.

      "bodyText": "It has become a common sight in the first three weeks of the invasion of Ukraine \u2013 Russian tanks, transporters and supply trucks burnt out at the side of the road, picked off by lightweight weaponry. While intrepid Ukrainian troops have been deploying the tactics, Britain has played a role in supplying the tech and the knowhow. While Britain\u2019s response to the refugee crisis in Ukraine has been heavily criticised, it is now widely acknowledged in the world\u2019s defence ministries to have played a leading role in arming Ukrainian troops with the most effective weapons, as well as training. \u201cWe can criticise British foreign policy at times, but we actually led,\u201d said Professor Sir Lawrence Freedman, emeritus professor of war studies, King\u2019s College London. \u201cThere has been very close cooperation with the Ukrainians for a while, so there was a good idea of what they\u2019d need, but it also had a good anti-tank weapon to send them. It was the first to send substantial equipment before war began, and it has made a difference.\u201d Those anti-tank weapon are the NLAWs, or next generation light anti-tank weapons, which have been so effective against Russian vehicles that have been left exposed as a result of a lack of military coordination. Britain\u2019s involvement in training troops dates back to Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014. In the face of some opposition within Whitehall, British military help for Ukraine was conducted through Operation Orbital from 2015. Ukraine\u2019s former president Petro Poroshenko has said that he inherited a decrepit armed forces when he came to power in 2014, which was transformed by western aid. About 22,000 Ukrainian troops have been trained through the programme. Meanwhile, the NLAWs have been very effective, with some sources reporting an extraordinary 90% hit rate. The weapons, which can be swiftly deployed at close quarters and discarded, are lighter than the similar Javelin anti-tank missile systems, which the US has been dispatching to Ukraine. So far, Britain has sent more than 4,200 NLAWs. However, while the supply of the weapons and past training from Britain have helped, military experts warn that there simply has not been time to help Ukraine with the more sophisticated training and weapons systems required for countering a full invasion. It has left Britain and others largely restricted to supplying the lightweight defensive weaponry used so far. The government has said it will supply Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine, though even that system requires significant training time. \u201cOperation Orbital has been very successful \u2013 but whether it proves successful enough is a different question,\u201d said defence analyst Prof Michael Clarke. \u201cThe Russians first of all will bring in bigger numbers. Secondly, all military forces will learn to adapt, so Ukrainians will probably not be finding such easy targets.\u201d Others warn that while Britain gave assistance to Ukraine in the years before the invasion, significant weaknesses remained in Ukrainian capabilities. Nick Reynolds, the research analyst for land warfare at Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), said that remedying those weaknesses or giving Ukrainian troops counter-offensive capabilities was now logistically very hard and risked leading to escalation. \u201cThere are limitations in terms of integrating kits, in whether Ukrainians can use it \u2013 and it is equipment we don\u2019t want to fall into Russian hands,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, there\u2019s just enormous difficulties in getting people trained up in terms of time.

      "bodyText": "Russia has rubbished reports suggesting its cosmonauts wore yellow suits with blue accents to show solidarity with Ukraine. The three cosmonauts wore the suits, bearing the colours of the Ukrainian flag, when arriving at the International Space Station (ISS), leading to speculation they were a show of support for the country Russia is attacking. However, on Saturday, Russia dismissed the idea as fanciful. The cosmonaut Oleg Artemyev said each crew picked the colours about six months before launch because the suits needed to be individually sewn. He added that they were chosen because all three graduated from Bauman Moscow State Technical University and so they chose the colours of their prestigious alma mater. In a statement on the Russian space agency\u2019s Telegram channel, Artemyev said: \u201cThere is no need to look for any hidden signs or symbols in our uniform. A colour is simply a colour.

      "bodyText": "Just over two years ago, I sat up in bed and realised, with a sinking feeling, that we were at the beginning of five years of a Tory government. I reached for my sketchbook, drew a self-satisfied troll and felt marginally better. This became a habit. Now, each morning while listening to the Today programme on Radio 4, I pick up a pen and sketch a response to the news. These drawings are loose and scratchy, the compositions uncomplicated and direct, and they do not take long. Once I have completed these daily sketches, I post them on social media, where they join all those other messages in bottles bobbing along on the cybertides. Last year, in response to requests, I collected them all into a rather unwieldy volume that I titled Five Years\u2026 A Sketchbook of Political Drawings \u2013 Volume One 2020. The response was so encouraging that I decided to do it again a year later. So now Five Years\u2026 A Sketchbook of Political Drawings Volume Two \u2013 2021 is piled high on my kitchen table, every bit as unwieldy as its predecessor. The year 2021 turned out to be a horrifying sequel to 2020 \u2013 a second instalment of the unprecedented events of the previous 12 months. In January, we watched agog as horned shamans and Confederate flag-wavers attacked the Capitol in Washington. In February, the Tory right clamoured for Covid restrictions to be relaxed as new variants arrived to shatter their maskless dreams. In March, Meghan and Prince Harry shared all with Oprah as his creepy uncle avoided helping US authorities with their inquiriesand David Cameron retreated to his shepherd\u2019s hut as news of his corporate lobbying broke. In April, the Russian bear continued to soil the woods on the Ukrainian border (little did we know what was to come). In May, the Dominic Cummings-Boris Johnson feud reignited, and in June there were reports of Matt Hancock caught in a Covid-breaching clinch. In July, Johnson got pinged on the eve of his self-proclaimed \u201cfreedom day\u201d in England, and in August, the Taliban plunged Afghanistan back into the dark ages while our holidaying foreign secretary found that \u201cthe sea was closed\u201d. September saw the silly sausages of the Democratic Unionist party protesting against the Brexit they voted for and panic buying at petrol stations, and revealed a Brexit shortage of HGV drivers. In October, Johnson escaped to a Spanish villa for some pretend painting photo ops, and in November took a jet back from the Cop26 climate conference, where he had nodded off during a speech. Then in December, Omicron arrived just as rumours of last year\u2019s Downing Street parties began to circulate. The year ended as it began, in turmoil, recriminations and a Covid Christmas. Recurring characters filled the pages as I sketched each day. There was that Russian bear, the furious silly sausage, long-suffering Britannia and her lion and, of course, our tousle-haired, pants-on-fire tinpot Churchill, in a ditch, naked as a newly clothed emperor, constructing champagne crate buses or cavorting in that hi-vis jacket. Johnson has danced through the sketchbooks of the last two years. As I continue drawing each day, I cannot help hoping that in 2023 the scandals will finally catch up with our glorious leader, but for now Sue Gray\u2019s report is all but forgotten as the tragedy of Ukraine unfolds. It looks as if that Russian bear and its evil master will dominate the pages of volume three.

      "body": "<p>Guanciale is bacon made from the jowl of the pig. It has a much more intense, piggy flavour than bacon. It has a high fat content and is delicious. You can eat it raw from the fridge, like lardo, or wrap things in it and bake them.</p> <p>It\u2019s a good way to take your cooking up a notch. Carbonara, for example, should be made with guanciale. I always use the recipe for carbonara as a kind of manifesto because there\u2019s no bacon, no parmesan, no cream and no extra egg yolks; all the things British people think you put in, but you don\u2019t. The key tastes are pepper, pecorino romano and the porky guanciale.</p> <p>I fry the guanciale in quite a hot dry pan so it\u2019s well browned but not yet crisp all the way through. In a metal bowl, beat together a whole egg per person, quite a lot of pecorino romano and a lot of black pepper.

      "bodyText": "Guanciale is bacon made from the jowl of the pig. It has a much more intense, piggy flavour than bacon. It has a high fat content and is delicious. You can eat it raw from the fridge, like lardo, or wrap things in it and bake them. It\u2019s a good way to take your cooking up a notch. Carbonara, for example, should be made with guanciale. I always use the recipe for carbonara as a kind of manifesto because there\u2019s no bacon, no parmesan, no cream and no extra egg yolks; all the things British people think you put in, but you don\u2019t. The key tastes are pepper, pecorino romano and the porky guanciale. I fry the guanciale in quite a hot dry pan so it\u2019s well browned but not yet crisp all the way through. In a metal bowl, beat together a whole egg per person, quite a lot of pecorino romano and a lot of black pepper. When the pasta is al dente, lift it out of the water, drain it, then toss it in the bacon and the fat in the hot pan. Add the lot to the pecorino and eggs and black pepper with a little water and stir it. It should thicken to the texture of cream.

      "body": "<h2>Aulis, Cartmel, Cumbria</h2> <p>In Cartmel in rural Cumbria, Simon Rogan works in splendid isolation. The owner of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/16/lake-district-restaurant-lenclume-wins-third-michelin-star\" title=\"\">L\u2019Enclume</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/18/how-lenclumes-michelin-win-is-taking-cumbria-to-the-top-of-the-foodie-table\" title=\"\">which won its third Michelin star in February</a>, spends little time on social media, seldom talks to other chefs and rarely eats out. As he puts it: \u201cWe\u2019ve a long-standing, unique style I don\u2019t want infiltrated by other things.\u201d</p> <p>Aulis, his development kitchen, is a silo even within this remote set-up. \u201cFor true creativity, you need a quiet, purpose-built area away from the cut and thrust,\u201d says Rogan. Housed in a former post office next door to L\u2019Enclume, it develops dishes for the restaurant and, creatively, operates at a tangent to prevailing food fashions. \u201cSimon wants his food and his ideas, in his style,\u201d says Aulis chef Ben Gallier.</p> <p>Working alone, the 32-year-old\u2019s five-day week is split between two days of dish development and, on three days, combining that with cooking Aulis\u2019s own \u00a3195-a-head tasting menu for six guests. This behind-the-scenes experience helps justify Aulis financially. L\u2019Enclume\u2019s first test kitchen was a cut-price, cobbled-together affair but, opened in 2010 and refurbed since, Aulis (named in memory of chef and former employee, Leo Aulis Lehtim\u00e4ki) is a slick, polished-concrete beauty.</p> <p>Aside from chefs\u2019 bibles, such as the five-volume, science-based <em>Modernist Cuisine</em>, the key reference materials at Aulis include a database of Rogan\u2019s recipes and reports on methods for preserving and fermenting produce from the Cartmel Valley farm, which supplies Rogan\u2019s restaurants. Those reports include warnings about occasional mishaps, such as an attempt to create a beetroot version of black garlic that delivered 50 kilos of mouldy waste. But, more than a decade into the project, this 12-acre farm has become a primary source of inspiration.</p> <p>\u201cWe do a lot of reacting to ingredients,\u201d says Gallier, who regularly tours the farm with Rogan, executive chef Tom Barnes and L\u2019Enclume\u2019s head chef, Paul Burgali\u00e8res. \u201cIt sounds fanciful but the best way to come up with dishes is standing in front of ingredients.\u201d Gallier likens it to browsing in the supermarket, spotting pork chops, and meal ideas popping into your head: \u201cYou\u2019re not going home and marinating them in <em>shio koji </em>[a Japanese marinade made from fermented rice, water and salt] but the principle is the same.\u201d</p> <p>Can you really achieve food faultless enough for three Michelin stars by responding so quickly to the seasons? Only within a rigorously planned framework.</p> <p>Alessandra Russo, 35, ran Aulis for three years, up until 2020 (she is now kitchen coordinator within Rogan\u2019s company), and can remember some dishes being turned around in two days, \u201cwhere the idea was right and maybe we had recipes already\u201d. That is rare but illustrates how Aulis enables L\u2019Enclume to stay nimble. Its dish development is built on 20 years of accumulated knowledge. To run Aulis, says Rogan, you have to be \u201ca walking L\u2019Enclume encyclopedia\u201d.</p> <p>Annually, Aulis produces 40 to 50 dishes for L\u2019Enclume. Roughly 40% of those are entirely new and 60% refine, fuse or jump off existing concepts or recipes, some reanimated from previously stalled ideas. Seasonal dishes are designed and tested months in advance of rollout. \u201cL\u2019Enclume has 20 chefs,\u201d says Gallier. \u201cThey need training, wines need matching. You can\u2019t change the menu ad hoc.\u201d</p> <p>Ideas for dishes \u2013 a mixture of detailed briefs and imaginative experiments \u2013 usually originate with Rogan, Barnes or Burgali\u00e8res, who increasingly act, says Rogan, as a committee. \u201cThey\u2019re happy to listen to ideas,\u201d says Russo, who is married to Burgali\u00e8res. \u201cBut they have specific ones you have to work on. You\u2019re not working independently.\u201d</p> <p>Prototype dishes are tasted at fortnightly meetings, followed by fastidious gram-by-gram variations as the dish is honed. \u201cYou need patience,\u201d says Russo. \u201cWhat you develop doesn\u2019t always succeed. Ingredients don\u2019t give flavours you expect, or you can\u2019t fix a presentation or it\u2019s too complicated [to make] during service.\u201d</p> <p>Often, says Rogan, he and his senior staff are at fault for their \u201cshite\u201d ideas. In rejecting the resulting dish, \u201cwe\u2019re not having a go at [the development chefs]. No one takes it the wrong way. We move on.\u201d</p> <p>Helpfully, Russo and Gallier understand Rogan\u2019s palate. He likes impactful, balanced dishes, well seasoned with salt (\u201ceven for chefs, he\u2019s top 1%,\u201d says Gallier), with good acidity. Gallier remembers a fermented cabbage dish with smoked beetroot sauce that, instantly, he knew Rogan would love for its \u201cbold smokiness, salinity, acidity\u201d.</p> <p>Customer feedback in Aulis can lead to late tweaks, such as dialling down an intense garum served with raw scallop. But new dishes on the Aulis tasting menu \u2013 typically, 25% of its 16 courses \u2013 are, by that stage, pretty much finalised. They have already been approved for imminent introduction to the menu for L\u2019Enclume.</p> <p>Occasionally, diners would eat at Aulis and score every dish out of 10. Ultimately, only one opinion matters. \u201cI test everything before it goes on the menu,\u201d says Rogan. \u201cThe buck stops with me.\u201d</p> <h2>Ottolenghi Test Kitchen, London</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"148426a3706e27919e176b867d6a4f9e7204c833\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/148426a3706e27919e176b867d6a4f9e7204c833/155_118_10174_6956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Noor Murad in the Ottolenghi Test Kitchen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"684\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Noor Murad in the Ottolenghi Test Kitchen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amit Lennon/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At Ottolenghi Test Kitchen, when chefs create a new recipe for publication they crave the approval of one person above all. But it is not Yotam Ottolenghi. Nor the Test Kitchen head chef Noor Murad. In fact, this arbiter of the recipes you cook from the <em>Guardian</em> <em>Feast</em> supplement or Ottolenghi\u2019s cookbooks does not even work at the Holloway site in north London.</p> <p>Instead, when OTK chefs finalise a recipe, they email it to 41-year-old Claudine Boulstridge, Ottolenghi\u2019s failsafe for 15 years, who tests it in her kitchen in Wales. Helped by family and neighbours (\u201cthey get what they call \u2018the finest cooked meals-on-wheels\u2019\u201d), she feeds back on everything. That means<strong> </strong>confusing instructions or missing ingredients, flavour, presentation and, despite the old jokes about Ottolenghi\u2019s ingredients, how easy or not it is to shop for the recipe.</p> <p>\u201cClaudine is the ultimate,\u201d says 32-year-old Murad. \u201cI don\u2019t know if she realises how much power she holds over us. We always say, \u2018If it has the Claudine seal of approval, we know we\u2019re good.\u2019\u201d OTK, which last year left its original Camden railway arch for the Holloway premises, deliberately uses ageing domestic appliances (there is one new oven, says Murad, \u201cwhich we all fight over\u201d), but Boulstridge brings a real-world veracity to its work.</p> <p>Originally a colleague of Ottolenghi\u2019s at Leith\u2019s Cookery School, Boulstridge tests \u201ca few recipes a day\u201d for OTK, and relishes her role. \u201cThey get a totally unbiased person cooking like someone buying the book would. I\u2019ve got shelves of cookery books and I\u2019m amazed at how a lot of recipes don\u2019t work. That\u2019s not fair on the public.\u201d</p> <p>That independent interaction \u2013 allowing staff freedom, encouraging personal ownership of ideas, within a collaborative framework \u2013 is typical of how Ottolenghi works. \u201cYotam\u2019s always around. Signing off, giving his input,\u201d says Murad. \u201cBut he\u2019s not a boss who dictates every step. He gives you room to be creative.\u201d</p> <p>This, says Ottolenghi, is key to how his various endeavours \u2013 delis, restaurants, cookbooks \u2013 remain distinctive within the wider Ottolenghi brand. \u201cAt a multiple-site business, only so much creativity can come from the top. It\u2019s a richer environment if people are allowed to create. It\u2019s the DNA of this company.\u201d</p> <p>Ottolenghi has always been open about this, too. From name checks for staff in newspaper columns to bringing them into book deals as co-authors, he has conscientiously promoted colleagues and their ideas. \u201cThat\u2019s valued,\u201d says Murad, whose second book in the OTK series, <em>Extra Good Things</em>, is due in September.</p> <p>In the restaurants, explains Ottolenghi, there is \u201cno flowchart\u201d to explain how new dishes are created. It is \u201cloose, informal\u201d. The head chefs are expected to cook seasonally but without stipulation about when or how radically their menus should change.</p> <p>OTK will tip off the restaurants about exciting products, such as the Tunisian spinach condiment <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/feb/29/yotam-ottolenghi-winter-vegetable-recipes-celeriac-cafe-de-paris-sauce-tomato-barley-stew-tunisian-potato-beans\" title=\"\">bkeila</a></em>, used in Neil Campbell\u2019s celeriac shawarma pitta at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/sep/30/rovi-london-ottolenghi-kitchen-ferments-with-gay-abandon-restaurant-review-jay-rayner\" title=\"\">Rovi</a>. But there is no pressure to act on these tip-offs. Similarly, the restaurants share a common recipe database and a \u201clong, flexible\u201d list of suppliers, to control costs, but, within reason, are encouraged to evolve their own identity. For example, <a href=\"https://ottolenghi.co.uk/restaurants/spitalfields\" title=\"\">Ottolenghi Spitalfields</a> has a stronger eastern Mediterranean accent, influenced by its head chefs, previously Turkish (Esra Muslu), now Greek (Xristos Karetsos).</p> <p>Ottolenghi and executive chef <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/oct/16/melk-tart-leaf-masala-bunny-chow-yotam-ottolenghi-south-african-recipes\" title=\"\">Calvin Von Niebel</a> advise on and taste new dishes before they launch. But it is rare for them to come across a dud. \u201cThey know what they\u2019re doing. By the time it comes to having a serious conversation, they\u2019ve spent a lot of time [on] the dish,\u201d says Ottolenghi.</p> <p>At OTK, Murad leads on Ottolenghi\u2019s <em>New York Times</em> recipes. <em>Guardian</em> recipes are created by the core team of four chefs. They work alone, recipes allocated to their strengths. \u201cBut we have team feedback tastings every day,\u201d says Murad. \u201cMy job is to make sure each person has support to get the recipe where it needs to be.\u201d</p> <p>Getting ahead of deadlines is essential, says Ottolenghi, \u201cso you can have fun and experiment\u201d.</p> <p>Inspiration comes in many forms, be it a new ingredient from a specialist supplier, an idea spotted when eating out or, in OTK\u2019s newspaper work, editorial themes arising from important dates such as Easter. \u201cAssign a theme and you\u2019re working within a framework,\u201d says Murad. \u201cThat gets ideas ticking.\u201d</p> <p>Amid such dispersed creativity, can Ottolenghi maintain a house style? Yes and no. Internal promotions, rolling conversations and, on occasion, new restaurant chefs spending time at OTK, means the core aesthetic is widely understood: abundant, vegetable-focused dishes, colourfully presented.</p> <p>But the Middle Eastern flavours most associated with Ottolenghi are, increasingly, just one prominent feature of his food. The influence of his staff \u2013 a United Nations of food geeks \u2013 is giving the company\u2019s work a more international feel. \u201cInstead of wanting us to conform,\u201d says Murad (Bahraini, English mum, studied in New York), \u201cYotam embraces that and invites that in.\u201d</p> <h2>Bab Haus, Caerphilly</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"701deada2aa1c434ed8335312997d35106796793\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/701deada2aa1c434ed8335312997d35106796793/434_0_7518_5389/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rebecca Goad, centre right, and Sophia, Leyli and Soraya Homayoonfarof Bab Haus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"717\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rebecca Goad, centre right, and Sophia, Leyli and Soraya Homayoonfar of Bab Haus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You will find Bab Haus hidden among the garages and builders merchants of Caerphilly\u2019s Bedwas House Industrial Estate, past Screwfix, opposite the Peter\u2019s Pies factory. It\u2019s a US-Mexican-style street food brand which, in everything from its use of ex-dairy beef to its signature birria tacos, is tuned in to the tastiest trends.</p> <p>\u201cWe get a lot of inspiration from social media,\u201d says 36-year-old chef-owner Leyli Homayoonfar, discussing the creation of dishes for her mainly takeaway barbecue outlet, HQ Smoke Shop, and its sister site, Bab Haus Mex, a taco spot in a shipping container in Barry. \u201cIt\u2019s 2022. People see something on their phone and want to eat it. We\u2019re trying to deliver that.\u201d</p> <p>Each Wednesday, the core team \u2013 Homayoonfar, her business partner Rebecca Goad and Homayoonfar\u2019s sisters, Sophia and Soraya \u2013 meet to plan the week and discuss any exciting foods they have encountered that \u201cfit our barbecue, smoking, fire narrative\u201d.</p> <p>These self-confessed \u201csuper-nerds\u201d have travelled in the US, have knowledgeable friends and family there, eat out and read widely. On WhatsApp, the team is in \u201ccontinuous\u201d dialogue about episodes of Netflix\u2019s <em>Taco Chronicles</em> or Instagram posts from inspiring fellow barbecue chefs such as Elliot Cunningham (@eatlagom) or Genevieve Taylor (@genevieveeats). \u201cCreatively, everyone\u2019s on the same level. That\u2019s what drives it,\u201d says Homayoonfar, whose youngest staff member is 19.</p> <p>If an idea is backed by the whole team, Homayoonfar will carve out time early in the week \u2013 as the production kitchen whirrs around her, curing bacon or slow-cooking meats in its wood-fired smoker \u2013 to develop recipes, first for four people, then gradually scaling up. Bab Haus meats can take 24 hours to cook and this \u201ctrial and error\u201d, initially documented in notepads and photos, can be laborious.</p> <p>Homayoonfar typically works on six dishes every month. Some are new menu additions, others created with future projects in mind. The challenges are both creative and practical. \u201cCan we execute this during service? Can it be made suitable for meat, veggie and vegan? How much will it cost? What cutlery will it need? It can\u2019t just be tasty.\u201d</p> <p>The birria taco kits, which made Bab Haus\u2019s name during the pandemic, took a few months to get right. \u201cThe dish isn\u2019t normally smoked but we smoke and slowly braise ox cheek, short rib and brisket in heavily spiced broth. You reserve the cooking liquor, shred the meat and it\u2019s served in a grilled cheese taco with liquor on the side, to dip your taco in.\u201d</p> <p>Goad had eaten birria from LA food trucks and Homayoonfar knew so-called \u201cred tacos\u201d from Instagram (stained a photogenic crimson by the broth). The pandemic prevented them from travelling to the US or Mexico to investigate further. Instead, they sought inspiration from cookbooks, including Gonzalo Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s <em>Nopalito</em> and Alex Stupak and Jordana Rothman\u2019s <em>Tacos: Recipes and Provocations</em>, interweaving that guidance with ingredients from specialist suppliers such as Cool Chile and MexGrocer, and, in Homayoonfar\u2019s case, 17 years of experience in professional kitchens. \u201cYou need sour, salty, sweet and fat in harmony. Seasoning can make or break a dish,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Even then, there was an element of luck involved. Homayoonfar had bought her Caerphilly unit from a ready-meal producer, inheriting packaging materials which, when the Covid pandemic hit, made the move into producing meal kits easier.</p> <p>Homayoonfar\u2019s business launched in 2019 as a Persian event caterer, Leyli Joon &amp; Co. Covid transformed it overnight. Bab Haus, intended as a street food sideline for the quiet winter months, became her sole focus. Later in 2020, this led to the launch of Bab Haus Mex. \u201cWe had no income, we were under pressure,\u201d says Homayoonfar. \u201cWe went into creative overdrive.\u201d</p> <p>Creating that new suite of dishes was daunting but it is a discipline \u2013 costing, documentation, deadlines \u2013 Homayoonfar is familiar with after working at Waitrose and Jamie Oliver\u2019s Recipease, developing dishes for their cookery courses. Despite that experience, there are still occasional missteps, great ideas (a delicate, time-sensitive, lime-cured sea bass ceviche, for example) that prove too stressful to deliver during service.</p> <p>Homayoonfar says that a development chef learns to accept dead ends and embrace robust feedback. She wants buy-in from her team to ensure they are enthusiastic about the product. During testing, she constantly seeks their opinion. \u201cFeedback has to be honest and constructive, and you\u2019ve got to listen. You can\u2019t force your ideas on someone. The person executing the dish has to believe in it.\u201d</p> <p><em>As a reader of the Guardian\u2019s food journalism, we\u2019d love to hear from you.

Housed in a former post office next door to L\u2019Enclume, it develops dishes for the restaurant and, creatively, operates at a tangent to prevailing food fashions. \u201cSimon wants his food and his ideas, in his style,\u201d says Aulis chef Ben Gallier. Working alone, the 32-year-old\u2019s five-day week is split between two days of dish development and, on three days, combining that with cooking Aulis\u2019s own \u00a3195-a-head tasting menu for six guests. This behind-the-scenes experience helps justify Aulis financially. L\u2019Enclume\u2019s first test kitchen was a cut-price, cobbled-together affair but, opened in 2010 and refurbed since, Aulis (named in memory of chef and former employee, Leo Aulis Lehtim\u00e4ki) is a slick, polished-concrete beauty. Aside from chefs\u2019 bibles, such as the five-volume, science-based Modernist Cuisine, the key reference materials at Aulis include a database of Rogan\u2019s recipes and reports on methods for preserving and fermenting produce from the Cartmel Valley farm, which supplies Rogan\u2019s restaurants. Those reports include warnings about occasional mishaps, such as an attempt to create a beetroot version of black garlic that delivered 50 kilos of mouldy waste. But, more than a decade into the project, this 12-acre farm has become a primary source of inspiration. \u201cWe do a lot of reacting to ingredients,\u201d says Gallier, who regularly tours the farm with Rogan, executive chef Tom Barnes and L\u2019Enclume\u2019s head chef, Paul Burgali\u00e8res. \u201cIt sounds fanciful but the best way to come up with dishes is standing in front of ingredients.\u201d Gallier likens it to browsing in the supermarket, spotting pork chops, and meal ideas popping into your head: \u201cYou\u2019re not going home and marinating them in shio koji [a Japanese marinade made from fermented rice, water and salt] but the principle is the same.\u201d Can you really achieve food faultless enough for three Michelin stars by responding so quickly to the seasons? Only within a rigorously planned framework. Alessandra Russo, 35, ran Aulis for three years, up until 2020 (she is now kitchen coordinator within Rogan\u2019s company), and can remember some dishes being turned around in two days, \u201cwhere the idea was right and maybe we had recipes already\u201d. That is rare but illustrates how Aulis enables L\u2019Enclume to stay nimble. Its dish development is built on 20 years of accumulated knowledge. To run Aulis, says Rogan, you have to be \u201ca walking L\u2019Enclume encyclopedia\u201d. Annually, Aulis produces 40 to 50 dishes for L\u2019Enclume. Roughly 40% of those are entirely new and 60% refine, fuse or jump off existing concepts or recipes, some reanimated from previously stalled ideas. Seasonal dishes are designed and tested months in advance of rollout. \u201cL\u2019Enclume has 20 chefs,\u201d says Gallier. \u201cThey need training, wines need matching. You can\u2019t change the menu ad hoc.\u201d Ideas for dishes \u2013 a mixture of detailed briefs and imaginative experiments \u2013 usually originate with Rogan, Barnes or Burgali\u00e8res, who increasingly act, says Rogan, as a committee. \u201cThey\u2019re happy to listen to ideas,\u201d says Russo, who is married to Burgali\u00e8res. \u201cBut they have specific ones you have to work on. You\u2019re not working independently.\u201d Prototype dishes are tasted at fortnightly meetings, followed by fastidious gram-by-gram variations as the dish is honed. \u201cYou need patience,\u201d says Russo. \u201cWhat you develop doesn\u2019t always succeed. Ingredients don\u2019t give flavours you expect, or you can\u2019t fix a presentation or it\u2019s too complicated [to make] during service.\u201d Often, says Rogan, he and his senior staff are at fault for their \u201cshite\u201d ideas. In rejecting the resulting dish, \u201cwe\u2019re not having a go at [the development chefs]. No one takes it the wrong way. We move on.\u201d Helpfully, Russo and Gallier understand Rogan\u2019s palate. He likes impactful, balanced dishes, well seasoned with salt (\u201ceven for chefs, he\u2019s top 1%,\u201d says Gallier), with good acidity. Gallier remembers a fermented cabbage dish with smoked beetroot sauce that, instantly, he knew Rogan would love for its \u201cbold smokiness, salinity, acidity\u201d. Customer feedback in Aulis can lead to late tweaks, such as dialling down an intense garum served with raw scallop. But new dishes on the Aulis tasting menu \u2013 typically, 25% of its 16 courses \u2013 are, by that stage, pretty much finalised. They have already been approved for imminent introduction to the menu for L\u2019Enclume. Occasionally, diners would eat at Aulis and score every dish out of 10. Ultimately, only one opinion matters. \u201cI test everything before it goes on the menu,\u201d says Rogan. \u201cThe buck stops with me.\u201d Ottolenghi Test Kitchen, London At Ottolenghi Test Kitchen, when chefs create a new recipe for publication they crave the approval of one person above all. But it is not Yotam Ottolenghi. Nor the Test Kitchen head chef Noor Murad. In fact, this arbiter of the recipes you cook from the Guardian Feast supplement or Ottolenghi\u2019s cookbooks does not even work at the Holloway site in north London. Instead, when OTK chefs finalise a recipe, they email it to 41-year-old Claudine Boulstridge, Ottolenghi\u2019s failsafe for 15 years, who tests it in her kitchen in Wales. Helped by family and neighbours (\u201cthey get what they call \u2018the finest cooked meals-on-wheels\u2019\u201d), she feeds back on everything. That means confusing instructions or missing ingredients, flavour, presentation and, despite the old jokes about Ottolenghi\u2019s ingredients, how easy or not it is to shop for the recipe. \u201cClaudine is the ultimate,\u201d says 32-year-old Murad. \u201cI don\u2019t know if she realises how much power she holds over us. We always say, \u2018If it has the Claudine seal of approval, we know we\u2019re good.\u2019\u201d OTK, which last year left its original Camden railway arch for the Holloway premises, deliberately uses ageing domestic appliances (there is one new oven, says Murad, \u201cwhich we all fight over\u201d), but Boulstridge brings a real-world veracity to its work. Originally a colleague of Ottolenghi\u2019s at Leith\u2019s Cookery School, Boulstridge tests \u201ca few recipes a day\u201d for OTK, and relishes her role. \u201cThey get a totally unbiased person cooking like someone buying the book would. I\u2019ve got shelves of cookery books and I\u2019m amazed at how a lot of recipes don\u2019t work. That\u2019s not fair on the public.\u201d That independent interaction \u2013 allowing staff freedom, encouraging personal ownership of ideas, within a collaborative framework \u2013 is typical of how Ottolenghi works. \u201cYotam\u2019s always around. Signing off, giving his input,\u201d says Murad. \u201cBut he\u2019s not a boss who dictates every step. He gives you room to be creative.\u201d This, says Ottolenghi, is key to how his various endeavours \u2013 delis, restaurants, cookbooks \u2013 remain distinctive within the wider Ottolenghi brand. \u201cAt a multiple-site business, only so much creativity can come from the top. It\u2019s a richer environment if people are allowed to create. It\u2019s the DNA of this company.\u201d Ottolenghi has always been open about this, too. From name checks for staff in newspaper columns to bringing them into book deals as co-authors, he has conscientiously promoted colleagues and their ideas. \u201cThat\u2019s valued,\u201d says Murad, whose second book in the OTK series, Extra Good Things, is due in September. In the restaurants, explains Ottolenghi, there is \u201cno flowchart\u201d to explain how new dishes are created. It is \u201cloose, informal\u201d. The head chefs are expected to cook seasonally but without stipulation about when or how radically their menus should change. OTK will tip off the restaurants about exciting products, such as the Tunisian spinach condiment bkeila, used in Neil Campbell\u2019s celeriac shawarma pitta at Rovi. But there is no pressure to act on these tip-offs. Similarly, the restaurants share a common recipe database and a \u201clong, flexible\u201d list of suppliers, to control costs, but, within reason, are encouraged to evolve their own identity. For example, Ottolenghi Spitalfields has a stronger eastern Mediterranean accent, influenced by its head chefs, previously Turkish (Esra Muslu), now Greek (Xristos Karetsos). Ottolenghi and executive chef Calvin Von Niebel advise on and taste new dishes before they launch. But it is rare for them to come across a dud. \u201cThey know what they\u2019re doing. By the time it comes to having a serious conversation, they\u2019ve spent a lot of time [on] the dish,\u201d says Ottolenghi. At OTK, Murad leads on Ottolenghi\u2019s New York Times recipes. Guardian recipes are created by the core team of four chefs. They work alone, recipes allocated to their strengths. \u201cBut we have team feedback tastings every day,\u201d says Murad. \u201cMy job is to make sure each person has support to get the recipe where it needs to be.\u201d Getting ahead of deadlines is essential, says Ottolenghi, \u201cso you can have fun and experiment\u201d. Inspiration comes in many forms, be it a new ingredient from a specialist supplier, an idea spotted when eating out or, in OTK\u2019s newspaper work, editorial themes arising from important dates such as Easter. \u201cAssign a theme and you\u2019re working within a framework,\u201d says Murad. \u201cThat gets ideas ticking.\u201d Amid such dispersed creativity, can Ottolenghi maintain a house style? Yes and no. Internal promotions, rolling conversations and, on occasion, new restaurant chefs spending time at OTK, means the core aesthetic is widely understood: abundant, vegetable-focused dishes, colourfully presented. But the Middle Eastern flavours most associated with Ottolenghi are, increasingly, just one prominent feature of his food. The influence of his staff \u2013 a United Nations of food geeks \u2013 is giving the company\u2019s work a more international feel. \u201cInstead of wanting us to conform,\u201d says Murad (Bahraini, English mum, studied in New York), \u201cYotam embraces that and invites that in.\u201d Bab Haus, Caerphilly You will find Bab Haus hidden among the garages and builders merchants of Caerphilly\u2019s Bedwas House Industrial Estate, past Screwfix, opposite the Peter\u2019s Pies factory. It\u2019s a US-Mexican-style street food brand which, in everything from its use of ex-dairy beef to its signature birria tacos, is tuned in to the tastiest trends. \u201cWe get a lot of inspiration from social media,\u201d says 36-year-old chef-owner Leyli Homayoonfar, discussing the creation of dishes for her mainly takeaway barbecue outlet, HQ Smoke Shop, and its sister site, Bab Haus Mex, a taco spot in a shipping container in Barry. \u201cIt\u2019s 2022. People see something on their phone and want to eat it. We\u2019re trying to deliver that.\u201d Each Wednesday, the core team \u2013 Homayoonfar, her business partner Rebecca Goad and Homayoonfar\u2019s sisters, Sophia and Soraya \u2013 meet to plan the week and discuss any exciting foods they have encountered that \u201cfit our barbecue, smoking, fire narrative\u201d. These self-confessed \u201csuper-nerds\u201d have travelled in the US, have knowledgeable friends and family there, eat out and read widely. On WhatsApp, the team is in \u201ccontinuous\u201d dialogue about episodes of Netflix\u2019s Taco Chronicles or Instagram posts from inspiring fellow barbecue chefs such as Elliot Cunningham (@eatlagom) or Genevieve Taylor (@genevieveeats). \u201cCreatively, everyone\u2019s on the same level. That\u2019s what drives it,\u201d says Homayoonfar, whose youngest staff member is 19. If an idea is backed by the whole team, Homayoonfar will carve out time early in the week \u2013 as the production kitchen whirrs around her, curing bacon or slow-cooking meats in its wood-fired smoker \u2013 to develop recipes, first for four people, then gradually scaling up. Bab Haus meats can take 24 hours to cook and this \u201ctrial and error\u201d, initially documented in notepads and photos, can be laborious. Homayoonfar typically works on six dishes every month. Some are new menu additions, others created with future projects in mind. The challenges are both creative and practical. \u201cCan we execute this during service? Can it be made suitable for meat, veggie and vegan? How much will it cost? What cutlery will it need? It can\u2019t just be tasty.\u201d The birria taco kits, which made Bab Haus\u2019s name during the pandemic, took a few months to get right. \u201cThe dish isn\u2019t normally smoked but we smoke and slowly braise ox cheek, short rib and brisket in heavily spiced broth. You reserve the cooking liquor, shred the meat and it\u2019s served in a grilled cheese taco with liquor on the side, to dip your taco in.\u201d Goad had eaten birria from LA food trucks and Homayoonfar knew so-called \u201cred tacos\u201d from Instagram (stained a photogenic crimson by the broth). The pandemic prevented them from travelling to the US or Mexico to investigate further. Instead, they sought inspiration from cookbooks, including Gonzalo Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s Nopalito and Alex Stupak and Jordana Rothman\u2019s Tacos: Recipes and Provocations, interweaving that guidance with ingredients from specialist suppliers such as Cool Chile and MexGrocer, and, in Homayoonfar\u2019s case, 17 years of experience in professional kitchens. \u201cYou need sour, salty, sweet and fat in harmony. Seasoning can make or break a dish,\u201d she says. Even then, there was an element of luck involved. Homayoonfar had bought her Caerphilly unit from a ready-meal producer, inheriting packaging materials which, when the Covid pandemic hit, made the move into producing meal kits easier. Homayoonfar\u2019s business launched in 2019 as a Persian event caterer, Leyli Joon &amp; Co. Covid transformed it overnight. Bab Haus, intended as a street food sideline for the quiet winter months, became her sole focus. Later in 2020, this led to the launch of Bab Haus Mex. \u201cWe had no income, we were under pressure,\u201d says Homayoonfar. \u201cWe went into creative overdrive.\u201d Creating that new suite of dishes was daunting but it is a discipline \u2013 costing, documentation, deadlines \u2013 Homayoonfar is familiar with after working at Waitrose and Jamie Oliver\u2019s Recipease, developing dishes for their cookery courses. Despite that experience, there are still occasional missteps, great ideas (a delicate, time-sensitive, lime-cured sea bass ceviche, for example) that prove too stressful to deliver during service. Homayoonfar says that a development chef learns to accept dead ends and embrace robust feedback. She wants buy-in from her team to ensure they are enthusiastic about the product. During testing, she constantly seeks their opinion. \u201cFeedback has to be honest and constructive, and you\u2019ve got to listen. You can\u2019t force your ideas on someone. The person executing the dish has to believe in it.\u201d As a reader of the Guardian\u2019s food journalism, we\u2019d love to hear from you.

Most readers are now familiar with the story of the power struggle inside Downing Street between a young, liberal clique <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/apr/30/boris-johnson-carrie-symonds-influence-no-10-extends-much-further-than-decor\">loyal to Carrie</a> and the former Vote Leave advisers Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain, which ended in victory for her. But Ashcroft helpfully traces these tensions back to their original roots, well before she entered No 10. In his telling, she first clashed with Cain when he was working for Johnson at the Foreign Office; she earned the now notorious nickname \u201cPrincess Nut Nut\u201d for supposedly meddling in her lover\u2019s run for the Tory leadership, and froze out his election guru Lynton Crosby during the 2019 election campaign. All these grievances were carried into power, with predictable consequences under pressure.</p> <p>There is an extraordinary bitterness to the extensive verbatim quotes, from heavily disguised anonymous sources, that follow. Carrie is portrayed as something of a spoiled princess, insecure and vengeful and lacking in \u201cintellectual depth\u201d. Worse, she has entrapped Boris in such an \u201cemotionally disruptive relationship\u201d that he seems actively scared of her. Similar claims have been aired before, not least by Cummings, but the charge here that there\u2019s \u201csomething not right\u201d about Carrie is a serious one. Yet it goes virtually unquestioned. Whoever his source is, Ashcroft apparently considers them beyond reproach.</p> <p>Carrie, we\u2019re told, just isn\u2019t up to the standards of the last wife; while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/nov/21/on-my-radar-marina-wheeler-cultural-highlights\">Marina Wheeler</a> organised his home life to perfection, Carrie is \u201cdemanding rather than supplying. I think it\u2019s the biggest explanation of the dysfunctionality inside Number 10... Marina was his wife but she was also in some respects a mother figure to him.\u201d This third marriage, our anonymous friend adds, is a \u201cGreek tragedy\u201d in which the great potential of a man we have just been told can\u2019t manage his own laundry has been squandered \u201c\u2018because of her\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/29/carrie-symonds-profile-boris-johnson-fiancee-dominic-cummings\">Under new management: is Carrie Symonds the real power at No 10?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The sexism rankles, obviously. But so does the way some big questions are left hanging. Is a man this chaotic actually capable of running a country? Was it really his wife\u2019s job to organise him, or a chief of staff\u2019s? Might the Downing Street operation take some responsibility itself for the chaos of the Downing Street operation? Yet the author largely contents himself with transcribing his mysterious but strangely familiar-sounding Deep Throat at length, before concluding gravely that while \u201cI know that the buck stops with [Johnson], the evidence I have gathered suggests his wife\u2019s behaviour is preventing him from leading Britain as effectively as the voters deserve\u201d.</p> <p>Feminist qualms aside, the most puzzling thing about all this is the leap from the first half of the book to the second. Carrie Johnson is depicted as a kind of glittering she-devil, with a mystical hold over her husband and the skills to outwit veteran political campaigners. How Carrie Symonds, the unmemorable schoolgirl turned very middle-ranking special adviser, morphed suddenly into this creature of semi-mythical powers remains unclear. Should the book not seek to explain this, if only to avoid cynical readers concluding that it\u2019s mostly another vehicle for the Vote Leave lot to work through their feelings about being dumped by Boris Johnson? Diana, Princess of Wales famously said that her marriage involved three people and so felt a bit crowded. With the Johnsons, it seems more like half an office-full. Maybe the real Carrie simply got lost in the crowd.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>First Lady: Intrigue at the </em><em>Court of Carrie and Boris Johnson</em> by Michael Aschroft is published by Biteback (\u00a320).

In his telling, she first clashed with Cain when he was working for Johnson at the Foreign Office; she earned the now notorious nickname \u201cPrincess Nut Nut\u201d for supposedly meddling in her lover\u2019s run for the Tory leadership, and froze out his election guru Lynton Crosby during the 2019 election campaign. All these grievances were carried into power, with predictable consequences under pressure. There is an extraordinary bitterness to the extensive verbatim quotes, from heavily disguised anonymous sources, that follow. Carrie is portrayed as something of a spoiled princess, insecure and vengeful and lacking in \u201cintellectual depth\u201d. Worse, she has entrapped Boris in such an \u201cemotionally disruptive relationship\u201d that he seems actively scared of her. Similar claims have been aired before, not least by Cummings, but the charge here that there\u2019s \u201csomething not right\u201d about Carrie is a serious one. Yet it goes virtually unquestioned. Whoever his source is, Ashcroft apparently considers them beyond reproach. Carrie, we\u2019re told, just isn\u2019t up to the standards of the last wife; while Marina Wheeler organised his home life to perfection, Carrie is \u201cdemanding rather than supplying. I think it\u2019s the biggest explanation of the dysfunctionality inside Number 10... Marina was his wife but she was also in some respects a mother figure to him.\u201d This third marriage, our anonymous friend adds, is a \u201cGreek tragedy\u201d in which the great potential of a man we have just been told can\u2019t manage his own laundry has been squandered \u201c\u2018because of her\u201d. The sexism rankles, obviously. But so does the way some big questions are left hanging. Is a man this chaotic actually capable of running a country? Was it really his wife\u2019s job to organise him, or a chief of staff\u2019s? Might the Downing Street operation take some responsibility itself for the chaos of the Downing Street operation? Yet the author largely contents himself with transcribing his mysterious but strangely familiar-sounding Deep Throat at length, before concluding gravely that while \u201cI know that the buck stops with [Johnson], the evidence I have gathered suggests his wife\u2019s behaviour is preventing him from leading Britain as effectively as the voters deserve\u201d. Feminist qualms aside, the most puzzling thing about all this is the leap from the first half of the book to the second. Carrie Johnson is depicted as a kind of glittering she-devil, with a mystical hold over her husband and the skills to outwit veteran political campaigners. How Carrie Symonds, the unmemorable schoolgirl turned very middle-ranking special adviser, morphed suddenly into this creature of semi-mythical powers remains unclear. Should the book not seek to explain this, if only to avoid cynical readers concluding that it\u2019s mostly another vehicle for the Vote Leave lot to work through their feelings about being dumped by Boris Johnson? Diana, Princess of Wales famously said that her marriage involved three people and so felt a bit crowded. With the Johnsons, it seems more like half an office-full. Maybe the real Carrie simply got lost in the crowd. First Lady: Intrigue at the Court of Carrie and Boris Johnson by Michael Aschroft is published by Biteback (\u00a320).

      "body": "<p>Earlier this month, former foreign minister Sir Alan Duncan warned of the risk of imposing too many sanctions on Russia. He warned the economic retaliation could backfire, with a high cost for Britain.</p> <p>The former Conservative MP highlighted in an interview the risk to future UK gas supplies from sanctions. The message was clear: ministers need to tread carefully in waging economic war against the Kremlin.</p> <p>Duncan, a former minister of state for Europe and the Americas, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s <em>Today</em> programme: \u201cOf course we want to disadvantage Russia, but we don\u2019t want to disadvantage ourselves that we fall into some kind of dystopian economic collapse. And we are on the edge of that.\u201d</p> <p>It was a sobering analysis, but failed to note that sanctions also threatened to bite into the revenues of some of the world\u2019s biggest energy traders, including Duncan\u2019s own employer, Vitol. It was said that Duncan worked for a large energy trader in the interview, but did not mention his firm\u2019s significant stake in the biggest oil project in Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union, one that Vladimir Putin has said will \u201cstrengthen Russia\u2019s position in the Arctic\u201d.</p> <p>While most of the international focus on the energy industry\u2019s links to Russia since the invasion of Ukraine has been on the major oil companies, including BP and Shell, major energy traders are now under mounting pressure over their links to Russia.</p> <p>Vitol and Trafigura, two of the biggest oil traders, have stakes in Vostok Oil, a vast oil and gas oil project in the Arctic. Campaigners warn it will transform a fragile ecosystem into a sprawling industrial hub. It is estimated the project will tap into more than 6bn tonnes of oil reserves, with output proposed to reach more than 100m tonnes a year by 2030, more than the output of the North Sea. w.</p> <p>It is one of Vladimir Putin\u2019s key projects, described by the <em>Moscow Times </em>as \u201cthe biggest project in the modern-day global oil industry\u201d. .</p> <p>The scheme will take advantage of the melting Arctic ice, transporting oil across once unpassable shipping lanes via the Northern Sea Route to Asia, circumventing western sanctions.</p> <p>The \u00a3110bn project is led by the state-owned Russian firm Rosneft, which is led by oligarch Igor Sechin. The UK government sanctioned Sechin, one of Putin\u2019s inner circle, with an asset freeze and travel ban, earlier this month.</p> <p>Vitol announced in October last year it had led a consortium that had taken a 5% stake in Vostok Oil, along with Singapore-based energy trader Mercantile &amp; Maritime. Trafigura said in December 2020 that it had acquired a 10% holding in the project.BP said last month it would divest its 19.75% stake in Rosneft which it had held since 2013. Bernard Looney, BP\u2019s chief executive, also stood down from the board of the Russian oil giant.</p> <p>Russia is the world\u2019s third-biggest oil producer after the US and Saudi Arabia. The US has banned Russian oil imports and Britain will phase them out by the end of this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cef5745efac7ab82377e28beb8f804fff812eee7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cef5745efac7ab82377e28beb8f804fff812eee7/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Igor Sechin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Igor Sechin, head of Rosneft, had sanctions imposed on him by the UK earlier this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergei Karpukhin/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Vitol and Trafigura now face questions over their links to Rosneft.

      "bodyText": "Earlier this month, former foreign minister Sir Alan Duncan warned of the risk of imposing too many sanctions on Russia. He warned the economic retaliation could backfire, with a high cost for Britain. The former Conservative MP highlighted in an interview the risk to future UK gas supplies from sanctions. The message was clear: ministers need to tread carefully in waging economic war against the Kremlin. Duncan, a former minister of state for Europe and the Americas, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cOf course we want to disadvantage Russia, but we don\u2019t want to disadvantage ourselves that we fall into some kind of dystopian economic collapse. And we are on the edge of that.\u201d It was a sobering analysis, but failed to note that sanctions also threatened to bite into the revenues of some of the world\u2019s biggest energy traders, including Duncan\u2019s own employer, Vitol. It was said that Duncan worked for a large energy trader in the interview, but did not mention his firm\u2019s significant stake in the biggest oil project in Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union, one that Vladimir Putin has said will \u201cstrengthen Russia\u2019s position in the Arctic\u201d. While most of the international focus on the energy industry\u2019s links to Russia since the invasion of Ukraine has been on the major oil companies, including BP and Shell, major energy traders are now under mounting pressure over their links to Russia. Vitol and Trafigura, two of the biggest oil traders, have stakes in Vostok Oil, a vast oil and gas oil project in the Arctic. Campaigners warn it will transform a fragile ecosystem into a sprawling industrial hub. It is estimated the project will tap into more than 6bn tonnes of oil reserves, with output proposed to reach more than 100m tonnes a year by 2030, more than the output of the North Sea. w. It is one of Vladimir Putin\u2019s key projects, described by the Moscow Times as \u201cthe biggest project in the modern-day global oil industry\u201d. . The scheme will take advantage of the melting Arctic ice, transporting oil across once unpassable shipping lanes via the Northern Sea Route to Asia, circumventing western sanctions. The \u00a3110bn project is led by the state-owned Russian firm Rosneft, which is led by oligarch Igor Sechin. The UK government sanctioned Sechin, one of Putin\u2019s inner circle, with an asset freeze and travel ban, earlier this month. Vitol announced in October last year it had led a consortium that had taken a 5% stake in Vostok Oil, along with Singapore-based energy trader Mercantile &amp; Maritime. Trafigura said in December 2020 that it had acquired a 10% holding in the project.BP said last month it would divest its 19.75% stake in Rosneft which it had held since 2013. Bernard Looney, BP\u2019s chief executive, also stood down from the board of the Russian oil giant. Russia is the world\u2019s third-biggest oil producer after the US and Saudi Arabia. The US has banned Russian oil imports and Britain will phase them out by the end of this year. Vitol and Trafigura now face questions over their links to Rosneft. Trafigura says it condemns the war in Ukraine; does not operate any assets in Russia; and is reviewing its options over its \u201cpassive shareholding\u201d in Vostok Oil. Vitol said: \u201cVitol is appalled and saddened by the unnecessary and unjustifiable loss of civilian life and the suffering inflicted. Vitol manages its business in full compliance with all applicable sanctions. Vitol has a small, passive and illiquid interest in an upstream asset controlled by Rosneft. Vitol does not have any directors or management in this asset. Funds relating to the transaction were paid in October 2021. No further payments are being made in relation to the investment. Whilst sanctions remain in place, no payments relating to the investment will be received.\u201d While sanctions do not ban trading in Russian oil, some of the biggest energy firms are reducing their reliance on the region. Shell bought a cargo of cheap Russian crude earlier this month, but later apologised and pledged to stop. An investigation of oil and gas shipments from Russian ports by the investigative website SourceMaterial this month found that since the invasion Vitol has loaded or was due to load seven cargos of oil products, some from Rosneft. A report on 16 March by the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based intergovernmental organisation, said Vitol had chartered very large crude carriers to ship Russian crude to China from north-west Europe. The report said Indian Oil Corp bought 3m barrels of Russian urals oil from Vitol for May delivery, its first delivery since the 24 February invasion of Ukraine. Vitol has complied with all sanctions in these shipments. Duncan was an oil trader in his early career and had a friendship spanning nearly four decades with Ian Taylor, the former chair of the Vitol group, who died in June 2020. Taylor was a major donor to the Conservative party and Duncan unsuccessfully lobbied for him to be given a knighthood in David Cameron\u2019s resignation honours. The recommendation was blocked by the honours committee after scrutiny of some of the questionable regimes where Vitol had done business. The firm agreed with the US department of justice in December 2020 to pay $164m to resolve a foreign bribery case. This arose out of alleged Vitol schemes to pay bribes to officials in Brazil, Ecuador, and Mexico. In his political diaries, In the Thick of It, published last year, Duncan reflected that he could have made his fortune with \u201cmany tens of millions in the bank\u201d if he had joined Vitol in the late 1980s instead of opting for a political career. He joined Vitol Services, a UK firm which is part of the group, as director of business development in January 2020, focusing on the Middle East and Pakistan, after resigning as a minister in July 2019 and standing down as an MP at the last election. A source close to Duncan said he had made it clear that he supported effective sanctions against Russia and he was not involved in any Vitol operations linked to the country.

      "bodyText": "When Parasite won the Oscar for best picture in 2020, it was seen as long-overdue recognition of the mastery of South Korean cinema. Bong Joon-ho\u2019s dark comedy about two families at opposite ends of the country\u2019s social spectrum was the first non-English language production in the 94-year history of the Academy Awards to win in the category. Having watched its neighbour soak up much of the critical acclaim reserved for east-Asian cinema \u2013 and TV series \u2013 Japan\u2019s moment could come this month with an understated drama from a director many in Hollywood would have struggled to name until recently. Drive My Car, Ry\u00fbsuke Hamaguchi\u2019s absorbing epic of grief, connection and art, is the first Japanese film in Oscar history to be nominated for best picture. His adaptation of a short story of the same name by Haruki Murakami \u2013 a perennial, but so far unsuccessful, candidate for the Nobel literature prize \u2013 was also nominated for best director, best adapted screenplay and best international feature. To put Hamaguchi\u2019s achievement into historical context, the last Japanese film-maker to be nominated for best director was the revered Akira Kurosawa, for Ran, 36 years ago. Hamaguchi\u2019s demanding, protracted work \u2013 whose opening credits arrive a full 40 minutes into the three hours \u2013 follows Y\u00fbsuke Kafuku (Hidetoshi Nishijima), an actor and theatre director who finds solace in female chauffeur Misaki Watari (T\u00f4ko Miura) after the sudden death of his wife, Oto. The industry\u2019s awards calendar has augured well for the 43-year-old Hamaguchi, who made his debut as a commercial director just four years ago, having won acclaim for his Tohoku documentary trilogy \u2013 co-directed with Ko Sakai \u2013 about the human tragedy unleashed by the triple disaster on Japan\u2019s north-east coast in March 2011. Drive My Car won the Golden Globe for best non-English language film in January and best screenplay at Cannes last year. Earlier this month, it secured a Bafta for best film not in the English language. \u201cThe more I think about this, the less sure I am,\u201d Hamaguchi said in a recent interview in attempting to explain how his film now stands on the brink of making cinematic history. \u201cBut one thing I can say is that this is a very normal movie. It\u2019s about people who have all these different flaws, each trying to have a better life for themselves. Loving someone or something is one way to do that. But when we love someone, one day you lose or separate from that person. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like an oxymoron. That\u2019s sort of the normal aspect of this film, that it\u2019s about the loss and gain of love.\u201d Since its release last year, a consensus has formed around Drive My Car as a film for our times. Some of it was filmed during the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 it ends with its characters in face masks \u2013 and, months after the roaring success of Squid Game, it has surely settled the argument over subtitles. As Phil Hoad wrote in explaining why Drive My Car should win later this month: \u201cThis powerful work is the perfect post-pandemic best picture winner, emerging from introspection and trauma with a calm realisation. It steps over Twitter-false dichotomies about blockbusters-v-arthouse with a total sense of absorption in its own purpose. In times like these, it\u2019s art that keeps the motor running.\u201d Hamaguchi is reportedly looking forward to meeting Steven Spielberg and Denzel Washington in Los Angeles, where Drive My Car will vie for best picture with, among others, Jane Campion\u2019s gothic western The Power of the Dog and Kenneth Branagh\u2019s autobiographical Belfast. But he has been quick to recognise Bong\u2019s role as a flagbearer for what is turning out to be a golden age for east-Asian film-makers and actors. A year after Parasite won four Academy Awards in major categories, Nomadland, directed by Chloe Zhao, the Chinese-born film-maker, won three Oscars \u2013 including best director \u2013 and the South Korean actor, Youn Yuh-jung, won the best supporting actress Oscar for her role in Minari. \u201cI feel that the reason that this film has been accepted around the world is that the actors\u2019 performances and voices are credible,\u201d Hamaguchi said shortly after Drive My Car\u2019s nomination, adding that Bong\u2019s film had smashed through the psychological resistance \u2013 and petty preconceptions \u2013 that once acted as a barrier to Asian films. \u201cWe, the next generation of Asian films, are going through the door that Parasite has opened,\u201d he said.",

When the British people voted for Brexit, in such large, large numbers, I don\u2019t believe it was because they were remotely hostile to foreigners. It\u2019s because they wanted to be free to do things differently and for this country to be able to run itself.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked about the comments, on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show, Sunak said: \u201cI don\u2019t think those two situations are directly analogous. Clearly, they\u2019re not directly analogous. I don\u2019t think the prime minister was saying they were directly analogous either.</p> \n<p>\u201cOne is a democratic referendum in a country where they were able to debate ideas in peace.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pressed on why Johnson used the words, the chancellor declined to elaborate, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t think the prime minister did either.

Of course they do. And there\u2019s lots of different ways they express that, whether it\u2019s through elections, through referendums, and other democratic means.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Conservative MP Robert Halfon also played down Boris Johnson\u2019s comparison of Brexit to Ukraine\u2019s fight against Russian invasion. Halfon, the MP for Harlow who chairs the education select committee, told BBC Breakfast: \u201cI don\u2019t think it is as big a deal as some people are making out.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe way I see it is the prime minister was saying we\u2019re a vibrant democracy.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson was not comparing Brexit to the fight by Ukrainians against the Russian invasion when he named the two as examples of people deciding to \u201cchoose freedom\u201d, Rishi Sunak has said, calling them \u201cobviously not analogous\u201d. Johnson prompted fury among political leaders in Europe, and opponents in the UK, when he made the comparison on Saturday in a speech to the Conservative spring conference in Blackpool. Saying the world faced a choice \u201cbetween freedom and oppression\u201d, the prime minister said: \u201cAnd I know that it\u2019s the instinct of the people of this country, like the people of Ukraine, to choose freedom, every time. \u201cI can give you a couple of famous recent examples. When the British people voted for Brexit, in such large, large numbers, I don\u2019t believe it was because they were remotely hostile to foreigners. It\u2019s because they wanted to be free to do things differently and for this country to be able to run itself.\u201d Asked about the comments, on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show, Sunak said: \u201cI don\u2019t think those two situations are directly analogous. Clearly, they\u2019re not directly analogous. I don\u2019t think the prime minister was saying they were directly analogous either. \u201cOne is a democratic referendum in a country where they were able to debate ideas in peace.\u201d Pressed on why Johnson used the words, the chancellor declined to elaborate, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t think the prime minister did either. Look, people will make up their own minds. I certainly don\u2019t think those two situations are directly analogous, and I don\u2019t think he does either.\u201d Asked if he agreed that the people of the UK, like those in Ukraine, would \u201cchoose freedom, every time\u201d, Sunak replied: \u201cI do think people in this country prize their freedom. Of course they do. And there\u2019s lots of different ways they express that, whether it\u2019s through elections, through referendums, and other democratic means.\u201d The Conservative MP Robert Halfon also played down Boris Johnson\u2019s comparison of Brexit to Ukraine\u2019s fight against Russian invasion. Halfon, the MP for Harlow who chairs the education select committee, told BBC Breakfast: \u201cI don\u2019t think it is as big a deal as some people are making out. \u201cThe way I see it is the prime minister was saying we\u2019re a vibrant democracy. We\u2019re such a vibrant democracy, we\u2019ve had a referendum. Ukraine wants to be a vibrant democracy and the Russians are trying to stop that.\u201d Asked if he thought the comments were \u201can insult to every Ukrainian\u201d, he said: \u201cAbsolutely not. No, I think the Ukrainians will be looking at what has been done in practice \u2013 \u00a3200m of aid, as I\u2019ve said, providing them with military support.\u201d Speaking on Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Labour\u2019s Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, called on Johnson to apologise: \u201cIt is utterly distasteful and insulting to compare the fight for freedom and the aggression of the Russia state to the decision to leave the European Union. \u201cIt is insulting to the Ukrainian people, who are fighting for their very freedom and their very lives, and it is insulting to the British people as well. If the prime minister didn\u2019t mean that analogy he shouldn\u2019t have made it.\u201d Johnson\u2019s remarks caused particular astonishment given that Ukraine has sought EU membership, and because of the suggestion that the EU is a form of tyranny to be escaped from. Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister who led the European parliament in Brexit negotiations, described the comments as \u201cinsane\u201d. \u201cBrexit was about undoing freedoms and leaving the EU,\u201d he said. \u201cUkrainians want more freedom and to join the EU.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s controversial urban congestion fund is pumping tens of millions of dollars more into marginal and safe Coalition seats than strong Labor electorates, a new report has found. The Grattan Institute on Sunday released a damning report examining the way successive governments have used transport spending promises to further their political interests. The report found due diligence was overwhelmingly lacking in transport promises made during election campaigns. At the last election, just one of the 71 Coalition transport promises worth $100m or more was based on a business case approved by Infrastructure Australia. Labor had business cases for just two of the 61 transport funding announcements it made during the same campaign. The report found a \u201clong and bipartisan history\u201d of pork-barrelling transport funding. Since 2004, under two Labor and four Coalition terms of government, the report said there had been a \u201cpersistent pattern\u201d of sending more transport dollars to New South Wales and Queensland, states which often decide federal elections. It also found the urban congestion fund \u2013 the government\u2019s much-criticised discretionary funding program for roads and carparks \u2013 overwhelmingly went to marginal seats. On average, a marginal urban seat received $83m from the fund and a safe Coalition seat received $64m. Safe Labor seats received just $34m on average, the report found. Report author Marion Terrill described pork-barrelling in transport funding as an \u201carms race\u201d. The quantum being promised by both parties jumped significantly between the last two elections. In 2016, the Coalition promised $5.4bn in transport spending, compared to Labor\u2019s $6.7bn. By 2019, that had jumped to $42bn for the Coalition and $49bn for Labor. Terrill said the federal government should concentrate its efforts on nationally-significant infrastructure, rather than hyper-local projects \u2013 roundabouts, overpasses, and carparks, for example. The government should also only fund such nationally significant projects after proper due diligence, she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s important about transport is that the dollars involved are really big, so when politicians engage in pork-barrelling with transport funding, there\u2019s an awful lot at stake,\u201d Terrill said.

Ministerial standards can be used, but only at the prime minister\u2019s discretion. Australia\u2019s electoral laws \u2013 while prohibiting someone providing, receiving, or offering benefit to influence a vote \u2013 do nothing to stop a party promising to spend public money to advance its own political advantage.

      "body": "<p>In the 1970s, Hank Balfour, a virologist at the University of Minnesota Medical School, was studying the long-term survival prospects of kidney transplant patients when he noticed that a small proportion of them went on to develop a rare form of cancer known as post-transplant proliferative disorder.</p> <p>He was particularly intrigued when he discovered that almost all of these patients had been infected with a virus called Epstein-Barr or EBV, a curious pathogen that has captivated and puzzled virus-hunters for decades.</p> <p>\u201cEBV can maintain latency within human cells,\u201d says Balfour. \u201cWhen we began studying it, it seemed that certain people were more prone to difficulties managing the virus immunologically, perhaps due to their genetic makeup, which allows the virus to put a damaging footprint on the immune system, causing long-term problems.\u201d</p> <p>For while \u201chit-and-run\u201d viruses such as Ebola or Sars-CoV-2 \u2013 which invade organs, wreaking havoc in their wake, before leaving the body \u2013 tend to make headlines in the virology world, EBV is a classic example of a \u201chit-and-stay\u201d virus. These infections silently assimilate within the body\u2019s tissues, in such a way that it is nigh on impossible for the immune system to get rid of them; they remain with us for the rest of our lives. Exactly what they do and how they affect our health has long been a mystery, but over the past 40 years, there has been mounting evidence that EBV is not as benign as it may seem.</p> <p>EBV <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK47424/\">has evolved</a> to coexist with humanity for millions of years, long before the advent of modern humans. It has become adept in hiding in a type of immune cell called B cells, where it stays for decades. Because most of us catch EBV in childhood \u2013 <a href=\"https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12879-019-4578-y.pdf\">more than half of children</a> in England have contracted EBV by the age of 12 \u2013 we do not even realise we have it. The only noticeable time when EBV rears its head is when teenagers or young adults become infected or immune-suppressed and develop mononucleosis or <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/glandular-fever/\">glandular fever</a>, an illness associated with extreme fatigue and swollen glands.</p> <p>However, the presence of the virus in our bodies has also been associated with about <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6691157/\">200,000 cases of cancer</a> worldwide every year, which develop years after infection. Associations have been made between EBV and Hodgkin lymphoma, as well as cancers of the head, neck and stomach. In particular, it is estimated that about <a href=\"https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/hodgkin-lymphoma/risks-causes\">40% of Hodgkin lymphoma cases</a> in the UK are related to EBV infection, with those who have previously had glandular fever being at a higher risk. EBV has also been associated with a range of autoimmune disorders, from <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.623944/full\">lupus</a> to <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.656797/full\">chronic fatigue syndrome</a>.</p> <p>But while the medical world has known about these links for some time, most doctors have been nonplussed as to what to do about it. The main problem is that EBV infection is ubiquitous \u2013 most estimates suggest that the virus is inside <a href=\"https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-09049-x\">95% of the world\u2019s population</a>. And because EBV-related cancers are relatively rare \u2013 fewer than <a href=\"https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/infections-eg-hpv-and-cancer/does-ebv-cause-cancer\">one in 300 cancer cases</a> in the UK, and about <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30125149/\">1.5% of cancers</a> globally, are connected to the virus \u2013 modern medicine has largely taken the approach of pretending that the problem does not exist.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem with EBV is that clinicians don\u2019t want to deal with it, because they don\u2019t really know what to do with it,\u201d says Balfour. \u201cAnd academic researchers, for some reason, have shied away from EBV, perhaps because of its complexity.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b008e342285bb7173a584b143d4d31969bc72ce3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b008e342285bb7173a584b143d4d31969bc72ce3/0_0_1772_1358/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hank Balfour, a virologist at the University of Minnesota Medical School, with colleagues\" width=\"1000\" height=\"766\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hank Balfour, a virologist at the University of Minnesota Medical School, with colleagues. Balfour says the complexity of EBV may have deterred researchers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Annandale Advocate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, this may be about to change. In January, <em>Science</em> published a <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj8222\">landmark study</a> that showed overwhelmingly that EBV is implicated in multiple sclerosis (MS), an incurable autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system.</p> <p>Scientists, led by Alberto Ascherio from the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, examined more than 10m blood samples from US military personnel collected over 20 years and identified that those who became infected with EBV were 32 times more likely to later develop MS. Perhaps tellingly, the levels of a protein called neurofilament light chain \u2013 a marker in the blood that indicates nerve degeneration is occurring \u2013 increased only after EBV infection.</p> <p>Ascherio explains that it was possible to prove this association for the first time only because of the sheer number of people involved in the study.</p> <p>\u201cThe high prevalence of EBV in the general population has been a huge obstacle in demonstrating a causal link in the past,\u201d he says. \u201cThis study shows that EBV is the leading cause of MS, but there are clearly other factors involved such as genetics and vitamin D deficiency among EBV-positive individuals. To provide an analogy, most smokers will never develop lung cancer, and similarly, most EBV-infected individuals will not develop MS.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>What determines vulnerability to EBV?</strong></h2> <p>So why is it that most of us can coexist unknowingly with EBV and never develop either EBV-related cancers or MS, but yet for some, the infection becomes a pathway to chronic illness?</p> <p>The answer lies in the delicate balance between the virus and the body\u2019s immune system. Hiding out in the body\u2019s B-cells, EBV emerges now and then to replicate and avoid getting eradicated altogether by immune defenders called T-cells. But if it is allowed to replicate too much because the host\u2019s T-cells are not functioning properly or they are immune-suppressed in some way, the virus can move into other tissues, causing damage.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>EBV can suppress the normal dying process of infected cells\u2026 they can then grow and develop into a tumour</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A recent example of this is in <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34204243/\">some cases of long Covid</a> where the symptoms have been linked to reactivation of EBV, a mechanism that has also been proposed as a cause of chronic fatigue syndrome. \u201cIt seems clear that EBV reactivation could play a role in long-term consequences of Sars-CoV-2 infection,\u201d says Jeff Gold, a researcher at the World Organisation, which studies long Covid. \u201cThe family of symptoms for some long Covid patients is identical to those we would expect from the virus reactivating.\u201d</p> <p>In the case of MS, Ascherio suggests the inability of the body to keep the virus in check means that EBV ends up in nerve cells. \u201cEBV-infected B-cells could be more prone to invade the central nervous system and cause damage,\u201d says Ascherio.</p> <p>He believes that the presence of the virus within the central nervous system induces an autoimmune reaction, because of coincidental similarities between <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm7930\">EBV proteins and the myelin sheaths</a> that form a protective layer around nerves in the brain and spinal cords. This causes the body to attack its own cells, leading to progressive degeneration.</p> <p>The factors that cause EBV-infected individuals to develop various forms of cancer are an even more complex mixture of genetics and immune dysfunction. It appears that EBV can suppress the normal dying process of infected cells, and if these cells happen to possess other aberrant mutations, they can then grow and develop into a tumour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"daae0f30bf6016a360efb231a3bc33026860e745\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/daae0f30bf6016a360efb231a3bc33026860e745/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blood samples\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">By examining more than 10m blood samples collected over 20 years, scientists were able to show that people infected with EBV were 32 times more likely to go on to develop MS.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phanie/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it is thought that the chances of this happening can be heightened by certain lifestyle factors. For example, <a href=\"https://infectagentscancer.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13027-021-00391-2.pdf\">chemicals</a> such as tobacco smoke, pesticides and food additives might be able to interact with EBV and either amplify its genome within B cells, or alter the way it interacts with the immune system in some malignant fashion.</p> <p>\u201cThe chances of an EBV-infected person developing an EBV-positive tumour are very, very low,\u201d says Alan Rickinson, a cancer researcher at the University of Birmingham, who has studied EBV for the past 50 years. \u201cBut of course there are predisposing factors that can increase the risk.\u201d</p> <p>Rickinson points to the example of nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC), one of the cancers that has been <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5597737/\">linked to EBV.</a> While people of southern Chinese ethnicity have been shown to be more genetically prone to getting NPC, this is not the whole story. In reality, the likelihood of someone developing NPC or not comes down to a combination of genetic susceptibility, EBV exposure and lifestyle factors.</p> <p>\u201cStudies from Hong Kong in particular have highlighted the practice of weaning infants on salted fish, a concoction known to contain potential carcinogens,\u201d Rickinson says. \u201cThis is one example of a lifestyle factor that may increase the chances of NPC developing later in life.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Can we vaccinate against EBV?</strong></h2> <p>When the connection between EBV and certain cancers began to emerge in the 1980s, Balfour set his sights on developing a vaccine to prevent people from becoming infected with the virus.</p> <p>Over the next 30 years, his efforts would repeatedly be knocked back as pharmaceutical companies stalled and mulled over whether such a jab would be economical.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It will take a very large study of long duration to demonstrate that an EBV vaccine prevents MS</p> <footer> <cite>Alberto Ascherio, scientist</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the advent of cheaper messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine technology over the past two years, and the discovery that EBV appears to be the main cause of MS, has added new impetus for bringing such a vaccine to market. As Balfour puts it: \u201cI think the evidence is now very, very strong that EBV is necessary for MS. And if you take EBV away, you don\u2019t get MS.\u201d</p> <p>After years of little progress, there are now three EBV vaccines in the pipeline. Moderna has turned its attention towards the virus, and is conducting <a href=\"https://www.massachusetts.edu/news/phase-i-clinical-trial-moderna-mrna-vaccine-epstein-barr-virus-starting-umass-chan\">phase 1 clinical trials</a> of an mRNA vaccine for EBV at 15 centres across the US, while research teams at the US <a href=\"https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/nih-researchers-make-progress-toward-epstein-barr-virus-vaccine\">National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</a> and Balfour\u2019s own lab are working on their own jabs.</p> <p>Moderna\u2019s clinical trial is targeting people in the 18-30 age range, but given that so many people contract EBV as children, the ultimate aim is to administer the vaccine to infants. However, there remain many challenges and questions ahead.</p> <p>\u201cOne obstacle is that it will take a very large study of long duration to demonstrate that an EBV vaccine prevents MS, so most likely experimental studies will need to rely on intermediate outcomes, such as whether the vaccine prevents EBV infection and mononucleosis,\u201d says Ascherio.</p> <p>The other question is whether the vaccine will need to provide what scientists call sterilising immunity \u2013 preventing the virus from binding at all to human cells \u2013 in order to prevent cancers and MS, or whether simply limiting the severity of the infection will be sufficient.</p> <p>\u201cThere are few vaccines that induce sterilising immunity,\u201d says Katherine Luzuriaga, a professor of molecular medicine at UMass Chan Medical School, who is leading Moderna\u2019s clinical trial. \u201cHowever, it is possible that an effective EBV vaccine could limit the dissemination of the virus, prevent aberrant immune reactivity, and reduce viral load at the initiation of infection, all factors that may play a role in downstream disease pathogenesis not only in MS but EBV-related cancers as well.\u201d</p> <p>Researchers are also interested in whether antiviral drugs that directly target EBV could provide ways of halting the progression of the disease in patients who already have MS. But while scientists have identified a number of candidates that can stop <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6429425/\">EBV replicating in a test tube</a>, finding a drug that can clear the virus from the body remains a challenge.</p> <p>But for Balfour, there is a sense of encouragement that progress is finally being made in an area that has been greatly neglected for so long.</p> <p>\u201cThe <em>Science</em> paper has been a gamechanger and a sort of vindication of something that I believed in,\u201d he says. \u201cFor a long time, there\u2019s been this known association between EBV and MS, but when I would apply for grants, people would still say that EBV has little if anything to do with MS. But now people are rethinking the value of an EBV vaccine, as we\u2019ve seen that it\u2019s much better not to get infected at all.\u201d</p>",

The main problem is that EBV infection is ubiquitous \u2013 most estimates suggest that the virus is inside 95% of the world\u2019s population. And because EBV-related cancers are relatively rare \u2013 fewer than one in 300 cancer cases in the UK, and about 1.5% of cancers globally, are connected to the virus \u2013 modern medicine has largely taken the approach of pretending that the problem does not exist. \u201cThe problem with EBV is that clinicians don\u2019t want to deal with it, because they don\u2019t really know what to do with it,\u201d says Balfour. \u201cAnd academic researchers, for some reason, have shied away from EBV, perhaps because of its complexity.\u201d However, this may be about to change. In January, Science published a landmark study that showed overwhelmingly that EBV is implicated in multiple sclerosis (MS), an incurable autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. Scientists, led by Alberto Ascherio from the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, examined more than 10m blood samples from US military personnel collected over 20 years and identified that those who became infected with EBV were 32 times more likely to later develop MS. Perhaps tellingly, the levels of a protein called neurofilament light chain \u2013 a marker in the blood that indicates nerve degeneration is occurring \u2013 increased only after EBV infection. Ascherio explains that it was possible to prove this association for the first time only because of the sheer number of people involved in the study. \u201cThe high prevalence of EBV in the general population has been a huge obstacle in demonstrating a causal link in the past,\u201d he says. \u201cThis study shows that EBV is the leading cause of MS, but there are clearly other factors involved such as genetics and vitamin D deficiency among EBV-positive individuals. To provide an analogy, most smokers will never develop lung cancer, and similarly, most EBV-infected individuals will not develop MS.\u201d What determines vulnerability to EBV? So why is it that most of us can coexist unknowingly with EBV and never develop either EBV-related cancers or MS, but yet for some, the infection becomes a pathway to chronic illness? The answer lies in the delicate balance between the virus and the body\u2019s immune system. Hiding out in the body\u2019s B-cells, EBV emerges now and then to replicate and avoid getting eradicated altogether by immune defenders called T-cells. But if it is allowed to replicate too much because the host\u2019s T-cells are not functioning properly or they are immune-suppressed in some way, the virus can move into other tissues, causing damage. A recent example of this is in some cases of long Covid where the symptoms have been linked to reactivation of EBV, a mechanism that has also been proposed as a cause of chronic fatigue syndrome. \u201cIt seems clear that EBV reactivation could play a role in long-term consequences of Sars-CoV-2 infection,\u201d says Jeff Gold, a researcher at the World Organisation, which studies long Covid. \u201cThe family of symptoms for some long Covid patients is identical to those we would expect from the virus reactivating.\u201d In the case of MS, Ascherio suggests the inability of the body to keep the virus in check means that EBV ends up in nerve cells. \u201cEBV-infected B-cells could be more prone to invade the central nervous system and cause damage,\u201d says Ascherio. He believes that the presence of the virus within the central nervous system induces an autoimmune reaction, because of coincidental similarities between EBV proteins and the myelin sheaths that form a protective layer around nerves in the brain and spinal cords. This causes the body to attack its own cells, leading to progressive degeneration. The factors that cause EBV-infected individuals to develop various forms of cancer are an even more complex mixture of genetics and immune dysfunction. It appears that EBV can suppress the normal dying process of infected cells, and if these cells happen to possess other aberrant mutations, they can then grow and develop into a tumour. But it is thought that the chances of this happening can be heightened by certain lifestyle factors. For example, chemicals such as tobacco smoke, pesticides and food additives might be able to interact with EBV and either amplify its genome within B cells, or alter the way it interacts with the immune system in some malignant fashion. \u201cThe chances of an EBV-infected person developing an EBV-positive tumour are very, very low,\u201d says Alan Rickinson, a cancer researcher at the University of Birmingham, who has studied EBV for the past 50 years. \u201cBut of course there are predisposing factors that can increase the risk.\u201d Rickinson points to the example of nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC), one of the cancers that has been linked to EBV. While people of southern Chinese ethnicity have been shown to be more genetically prone to getting NPC, this is not the whole story. In reality, the likelihood of someone developing NPC or not comes down to a combination of genetic susceptibility, EBV exposure and lifestyle factors. \u201cStudies from Hong Kong in particular have highlighted the practice of weaning infants on salted fish, a concoction known to contain potential carcinogens,\u201d Rickinson says. \u201cThis is one example of a lifestyle factor that may increase the chances of NPC developing later in life.\u201d Can we vaccinate against EBV? When the connection between EBV and certain cancers began to emerge in the 1980s, Balfour set his sights on developing a vaccine to prevent people from becoming infected with the virus. Over the next 30 years, his efforts would repeatedly be knocked back as pharmaceutical companies stalled and mulled over whether such a jab would be economical. But the advent of cheaper messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine technology over the past two years, and the discovery that EBV appears to be the main cause of MS, has added new impetus for bringing such a vaccine to market. As Balfour puts it: \u201cI think the evidence is now very, very strong that EBV is necessary for MS. And if you take EBV away, you don\u2019t get MS.\u201d After years of little progress, there are now three EBV vaccines in the pipeline. Moderna has turned its attention towards the virus, and is conducting phase 1 clinical trials of an mRNA vaccine for EBV at 15 centres across the US, while research teams at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Balfour\u2019s own lab are working on their own jabs. Moderna\u2019s clinical trial is targeting people in the 18-30 age range, but given that so many people contract EBV as children, the ultimate aim is to administer the vaccine to infants. However, there remain many challenges and questions ahead. \u201cOne obstacle is that it will take a very large study of long duration to demonstrate that an EBV vaccine prevents MS, so most likely experimental studies will need to rely on intermediate outcomes, such as whether the vaccine prevents EBV infection and mononucleosis,\u201d says Ascherio. The other question is whether the vaccine will need to provide what scientists call sterilising immunity \u2013 preventing the virus from binding at all to human cells \u2013 in order to prevent cancers and MS, or whether simply limiting the severity of the infection will be sufficient. \u201cThere are few vaccines that induce sterilising immunity,\u201d says Katherine Luzuriaga, a professor of molecular medicine at UMass Chan Medical School, who is leading Moderna\u2019s clinical trial. \u201cHowever, it is possible that an effective EBV vaccine could limit the dissemination of the virus, prevent aberrant immune reactivity, and reduce viral load at the initiation of infection, all factors that may play a role in downstream disease pathogenesis not only in MS but EBV-related cancers as well.\u201d Researchers are also interested in whether antiviral drugs that directly target EBV could provide ways of halting the progression of the disease in patients who already have MS. But while scientists have identified a number of candidates that can stop EBV replicating in a test tube, finding a drug that can clear the virus from the body remains a challenge. But for Balfour, there is a sense of encouragement that progress is finally being made in an area that has been greatly neglected for so long. \u201cThe Science paper has been a gamechanger and a sort of vindication of something that I believed in,\u201d he says. \u201cFor a long time, there\u2019s been this known association between EBV and MS, but when I would apply for grants, people would still say that EBV has little if anything to do with MS. But now people are rethinking the value of an EBV vaccine, as we\u2019ve seen that it\u2019s much better not to get infected at all.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Employers across the US have been dealing with a historic shift in labor thanks to the pandemic. We know it as the Great Resignation, and the pundits have been falling over themselves to explain to us why employers are at fault. Now it looks like the Great Resignation may be followed by the Great Regret. There\u2019s no doubt employers have a lot to learn from the unprecedented rate of job turnover. Researchers at the consulting firm McKinsey, for example, say that employees are tired, and many are grieving. \u201cThey want a renewed and revised sense of purpose in their work,\u201d write its authors. \u201cThey want social and interpersonal connections with their colleagues and managers. They want to feel a sense of shared identity. They want meaningful \u2013 though not necessarily in-person \u2013 interactions, not just transactions.\u201d Unfortunately, some of us are not sympathetic enough to these needs. So our employees leave. Research firm Gartner says this week that more than 70% of information technology workers are looking to change jobs this year and urges employers to adopt a more \u201chuman-centric\u201d work model that includes better working hours, more productive meetings and greater flexibility to reduce this turnover. Then there\u2019s the \u201clow pay, a lack of opportunities for advancement and feeling disrespected at work\u201d, which are the top reasons why Americans quit their jobs last year according to Pew Research in a new study. The study also found \u201cthose who quit and are now employed elsewhere are more likely than not to say their current job has better pay, more opportunities for advancement and more work-life balance and flexibility\u201d. But are they? Are all these workers leaving their jobs for new jobs finding that the new jobs are that much better than their old jobs? That their new employers are that much better than their existing employers? Or is it possible that Joe is taking a new job that\u2019s replacing Susan, who left that job for the same reason that Joe is leaving his job? Yes, there\u2019s lots of turnover and lots of people changing jobs. But given the fact that most are likely just swapping these jobs, maybe the problem isn\u2019t all with the employer.

      "body": "<p>The emergence of the expression \u201cget a handle on\u201d as a more modern version of \u201cget to grips with\u201d is an apt linguistic reflection of the history of technology. Putting handles on things is more modern than gripping them \u2013 2.1 million years more modern, apparently.</p> <p>That sounds like a dizzying amount more modern to those of us living in this era of fast technological change. Can you imagine something 2.1 million years more modern than the latest iPhone? What would it be like? Some lights in a cloud of semi-opaque gas that follows you around sending all your data to the giant gas god in space that feeds on it and defecates long seasons of high-budget quality drama that trail down on to the Earth like goldfish poos on to gravel?</p> <p>I feel like it would be even weirder than that and any future-people who read this, maybe as part of some internet archaeology module, will laugh scornfully at my temporal parochialism through special new mouths they\u2019ve swiftly evolved so they don\u2019t have to endure even a momentary pause in their ingestion of delicious morphine pistachios.</p> <p>But most ages aren\u2019t as fraught with science as ours. 2.1 million years more modern than a hand axe is just an axe with a handle. That\u2019s how much later the first tools with handles were than the first tools without them. That seems fairly slow going and makes me feel better about having taken several years to think of putting a shoe rack by the front door.</p> <p>Handles, according to a Liverpool University study published last week in <em><a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rsos/registered-reports?gclid=Cj0KCQjwuMuRBhCJARIsAHXdnqO0Nvf2Z1B7WqsDvKIjGzZGPUHCtq54_6kmyCPG1IYYs2yO1HUnzlYaAk7pEALw_wcB\">Royal Society Open Science</a></em>, were a massive breakthrough for humanity, arguably more significant than the wheel, which didn\u2019t trundle into existence for another 500,000 years. Tools with handles were much handier than those without \u2013 though the word should surely be handlier. You could apply more force to objects without expending more energy.</p> <p>Not every human invention has the resilience of handles, though handles aren\u2019t always resilient. They often break but, in doing so, only reinforce the soundness of the concept. Does anyone fully appreciate the handles on a plastic bag until they snap? You don\u2019t think: \u201cThere must be a better way!\u201d You just want a new handle.</p> <p>Not so CDs. Their annoying unreliability, their propensity to get scratched and skip, to become grubby and then get further scratched when you wipe them, their maddening, clattery, self-disassembling boxes and, worst of all, the blood of the cassette tape that they have on their metaphorical hands, have all contributed to their decline. Some analysts were predicting that the CD market was about to be overtaken by vinyl. What a humiliation for the younger format! It would be like Steve Davis beating Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t happen. It was <a href=\"https://completemusicupdate.com/article/uk-record-industry-revenues-grew-12-8-in-2021/\">announced last week</a> that CD sales rallied in 2021, spearheaded by the new Adele and Abba albums, reaching \u00a3117.2m, a rise of 1.4% and the first increase in four years. Meanwhile, vinyl only reached \u00a3116m, though that represented growth of 34% and happened despite a global shortage of PVC (one of the few global shortages I hadn\u2019t previously heard of, thanks to my unimpeachable private life).</p> <p>The bigger picture here, according to the British Phonographic Industry, which <a href=\"https://www.bpi.co.uk/news-analysis/2021-in-music-more-artists-succeed-as-streaming-drives-music-growth-fuelled-by-record-label-investment/\">released the figures</a>, is that physical music sales grew faster than streaming revenue. That\u2019s a bit of a blow for the current economic orthodoxy. People still want the old breakable objects, not just weightless data. They\u2019re bored with playing on their computers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The internet, in its diabolical folly, created an unwrappable delivery mechanism: streaming. It was never going to work</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What is behind this crazy new spending pattern? Is NHS prioritisation of physical over mental health to blame for this irrational Luddism, this spurning of our wondrous devices? It can\u2019t be, because it\u2019s happening in America as well. CD sales up, <a href=\"https://goodereader.com/blog/e-book-news/us-ebook-revenue-declined-by-4-7-in-2021#:~:text=Revenue%20for%20digital%20books%20in,at%20%24766.2%20million%20in%20revenue.\">ebook sales down</a> \u2013 it\u2019s hard to get a handle on it.</p> <p>I reckon the explanation lies in a human invention even more powerful than either the handle or the wheel \u2013 an innovation that has enormously magnified our capacity for economic growth. It\u2019s the gift. The gift, the present, is the thought that counts financially. It has supercharged capitalism. On top of the other reasons to spend money \u2013 because you need something, because you want something, because it\u2019s cheap so you\u2019ll get lots of it, because it\u2019s expensive so you have to pay lots to get one of it \u2013 there\u2019s this extra element: buying something you don\u2019t want for someone else who probably doesn\u2019t either.</p> <p>The social conventions surrounding gift-giving are strict. Aside from occasions when you might genuinely want to give someone something and have a reasonable idea of what they\u2019d like, there are many many others \u2013 Christmas, birthdays, weddings, etc \u2013 where you have no idea what they want, other than the dozens or hundreds of things they already possess, but nevertheless absolutely have to give them something.</p> <p>When you can\u2019t think of anything, books, tunes and films are perfect. There\u2019s no limit to the number that it\u2019s deemed appropriate to own and it\u2019s easy, by your choice of title, to demonstrate the obligatory level of thought. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a dog \u2013 here\u2019s a book about dogs!\u201d</p> <p>Ask any publisher and they\u2019ll tell you how vital this is. The printing and selling of books exclusively to those who want to read them doesn\u2019t constitute a viable industry. It relies on the giving of vast numbers of the things to people who may not even open them. And the same principle used to apply to films and music until the internet, in its diabolical folly, developed an unwrappable delivery mechanism: streaming.</p> <p>That was never going to work. It risked restricting album and video purchases just to the people who actually wanted to consume those albums and videos. Some will fall for a lame sort of emailed token, perhaps with an animation of a present on it, but normal people know that\u2019s like a drinks party on Zoom \u2013 it doesn\u2019t count.</p> <p>The invisible hand of the market is at work and it\u2019s only taken 20 years, not 2.1 million. If a commodity can\u2019t be gift-wrapped and put under a tree, people will only buy as much as they need. That won\u2019t keep the lights on at Amazon, let alone Westfield.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The emergence of the expression \u201cget a handle on\u201d as a more modern version of \u201cget to grips with\u201d is an apt linguistic reflection of the history of technology. Putting handles on things is more modern than gripping them \u2013 2.1 million years more modern, apparently. That sounds like a dizzying amount more modern to those of us living in this era of fast technological change. Can you imagine something 2.1 million years more modern than the latest iPhone? What would it be like? Some lights in a cloud of semi-opaque gas that follows you around sending all your data to the giant gas god in space that feeds on it and defecates long seasons of high-budget quality drama that trail down on to the Earth like goldfish poos on to gravel? I feel like it would be even weirder than that and any future-people who read this, maybe as part of some internet archaeology module, will laugh scornfully at my temporal parochialism through special new mouths they\u2019ve swiftly evolved so they don\u2019t have to endure even a momentary pause in their ingestion of delicious morphine pistachios. But most ages aren\u2019t as fraught with science as ours. 2.1 million years more modern than a hand axe is just an axe with a handle. That\u2019s how much later the first tools with handles were than the first tools without them. That seems fairly slow going and makes me feel better about having taken several years to think of putting a shoe rack by the front door. Handles, according to a Liverpool University study published last week in Royal Society Open Science, were a massive breakthrough for humanity, arguably more significant than the wheel, which didn\u2019t trundle into existence for another 500,000 years. Tools with handles were much handier than those without \u2013 though the word should surely be handlier. You could apply more force to objects without expending more energy. Not every human invention has the resilience of handles, though handles aren\u2019t always resilient. They often break but, in doing so, only reinforce the soundness of the concept. Does anyone fully appreciate the handles on a plastic bag until they snap? You don\u2019t think: \u201cThere must be a better way!\u201d You just want a new handle. Not so CDs. Their annoying unreliability, their propensity to get scratched and skip, to become grubby and then get further scratched when you wipe them, their maddening, clattery, self-disassembling boxes and, worst of all, the blood of the cassette tape that they have on their metaphorical hands, have all contributed to their decline. Some analysts were predicting that the CD market was about to be overtaken by vinyl. What a humiliation for the younger format! It would be like Steve Davis beating Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan. It didn\u2019t happen. It was announced last week that CD sales rallied in 2021, spearheaded by the new Adele and Abba albums, reaching \u00a3117.2m, a rise of 1.4% and the first increase in four years. Meanwhile, vinyl only reached \u00a3116m, though that represented growth of 34% and happened despite a global shortage of PVC (one of the few global shortages I hadn\u2019t previously heard of, thanks to my unimpeachable private life). The bigger picture here, according to the British Phonographic Industry, which released the figures, is that physical music sales grew faster than streaming revenue. That\u2019s a bit of a blow for the current economic orthodoxy. People still want the old breakable objects, not just weightless data. They\u2019re bored with playing on their computers. What is behind this crazy new spending pattern? Is NHS prioritisation of physical over mental health to blame for this irrational Luddism, this spurning of our wondrous devices? It can\u2019t be, because it\u2019s happening in America as well. CD sales up, ebook sales down \u2013 it\u2019s hard to get a handle on it. I reckon the explanation lies in a human invention even more powerful than either the handle or the wheel \u2013 an innovation that has enormously magnified our capacity for economic growth. It\u2019s the gift. The gift, the present, is the thought that counts financially. It has supercharged capitalism. On top of the other reasons to spend money \u2013 because you need something, because you want something, because it\u2019s cheap so you\u2019ll get lots of it, because it\u2019s expensive so you have to pay lots to get one of it \u2013 there\u2019s this extra element: buying something you don\u2019t want for someone else who probably doesn\u2019t either. The social conventions surrounding gift-giving are strict. Aside from occasions when you might genuinely want to give someone something and have a reasonable idea of what they\u2019d like, there are many many others \u2013 Christmas, birthdays, weddings, etc \u2013 where you have no idea what they want, other than the dozens or hundreds of things they already possess, but nevertheless absolutely have to give them something. When you can\u2019t think of anything, books, tunes and films are perfect. There\u2019s no limit to the number that it\u2019s deemed appropriate to own and it\u2019s easy, by your choice of title, to demonstrate the obligatory level of thought. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a dog \u2013 here\u2019s a book about dogs!\u201d Ask any publisher and they\u2019ll tell you how vital this is. The printing and selling of books exclusively to those who want to read them doesn\u2019t constitute a viable industry. It relies on the giving of vast numbers of the things to people who may not even open them. And the same principle used to apply to films and music until the internet, in its diabolical folly, developed an unwrappable delivery mechanism: streaming. That was never going to work. It risked restricting album and video purchases just to the people who actually wanted to consume those albums and videos. Some will fall for a lame sort of emailed token, perhaps with an animation of a present on it, but normal people know that\u2019s like a drinks party on Zoom \u2013 it doesn\u2019t count. The invisible hand of the market is at work and it\u2019s only taken 20 years, not 2.1 million. If a commodity can\u2019t be gift-wrapped and put under a tree, people will only buy as much as they need. That won\u2019t keep the lights on at Amazon, let alone Westfield.",

Returning for the pandemic-delayed Netflix second series, the fourth if you count the first two on Channel 4 (and you must), still largely written by creator Ronan Bennett and directed by, among others, Brady Hood, there\u2019s a pointed lack of vicarious <em>Scarface</em>-style thrills. Titular \u201cTop Boy\u201d Dushane (Ashley Walters) doesn\u2019t shove his face into a mound of cocaine. Drugs \u2013 coded as \u201cfood\u201d \u2013 could be cornflakes for all the ceremony they\u2019re afforded.</p> <p>In truth, <em>Top Boy</em> isn\u2019t about drugs, it\u2019s about love, death, loyalty, money, power, rivalry, betrayal. If it glamorises anything, it\u2019s the concept of found-family \u2013 of belonging \u2013 until, shockingly, it doesn\u2019t even glamorise that any more.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Dushane keeps reminding people to remove their shoes before entering his palatial new pad</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Arriving in eight parts (available as a box set), the new series kicks off with Jamie (Micheal Ward) leaving prison, and, in spite of his attempted coup, going back to work with Dushane. \u201cIt\u2019s just bad we\u2019re here again, innit,\u201d says Dushane, softly smiling with all the warmth of a slowly surfacing shark. Completing our trio of crack-cocaine musketeers, there\u2019s Sully (Kane \u2013 Kano \u2013 Robinson), living on a barge (just go with it) and nursing grudges that throb like malignant tumours.</p> <p>From there, it\u2019s a dizzying whirl around a multifaceted hell: with themes including Windrush, Spanish-Moroccan drug-runs, dumped bodies, and an ending so stark you almost feel like ordering them back to re-do it. Female characters push through stronger: sphinx-like Jaq (Emmy-nominated Jasmine Jobson) finds a lesbian lover, and grapples with a terrifying Liverpool-based subplot; Shelley (Simbi \u2013 Little Simz \u2013 Ajikawo) has secrets oozing up from the London mud.

      "bodyText": "Top Boy | Netflix Holding (ITV) | ITV Hub WeCrashed | AppleTV+ Ukraine: Should We Do More? (Channel 4) | All 4 Like all great shows about drug-dealing, Top Boy \u2013 set on an east London housing estate \u2013 couldn\u2019t care less about drugs. Returning for the pandemic-delayed Netflix second series, the fourth if you count the first two on Channel 4 (and you must), still largely written by creator Ronan Bennett and directed by, among others, Brady Hood, there\u2019s a pointed lack of vicarious Scarface-style thrills. Titular \u201cTop Boy\u201d Dushane (Ashley Walters) doesn\u2019t shove his face into a mound of cocaine. Drugs \u2013 coded as \u201cfood\u201d \u2013 could be cornflakes for all the ceremony they\u2019re afforded. In truth, Top Boy isn\u2019t about drugs, it\u2019s about love, death, loyalty, money, power, rivalry, betrayal. If it glamorises anything, it\u2019s the concept of found-family \u2013 of belonging \u2013 until, shockingly, it doesn\u2019t even glamorise that any more. Arriving in eight parts (available as a box set), the new series kicks off with Jamie (Micheal Ward) leaving prison, and, in spite of his attempted coup, going back to work with Dushane. \u201cIt\u2019s just bad we\u2019re here again, innit,\u201d says Dushane, softly smiling with all the warmth of a slowly surfacing shark. Completing our trio of crack-cocaine musketeers, there\u2019s Sully (Kane \u2013 Kano \u2013 Robinson), living on a barge (just go with it) and nursing grudges that throb like malignant tumours. From there, it\u2019s a dizzying whirl around a multifaceted hell: with themes including Windrush, Spanish-Moroccan drug-runs, dumped bodies, and an ending so stark you almost feel like ordering them back to re-do it. Female characters push through stronger: sphinx-like Jaq (Emmy-nominated Jasmine Jobson) finds a lesbian lover, and grapples with a terrifying Liverpool-based subplot; Shelley (Simbi \u2013 Little Simz \u2013 Ajikawo) has secrets oozing up from the London mud. Just as there are plans to gentrify the Summerhouse estate, Dushane \u2013 trying to go \u201clegit\u201d \u2013 seems a little refurbished himself: he keeps reminding people to remove their shoes before entering his palatial new pad. While such scenes echo Idris Elba as Stringer Bell sweating over his drug baron business plans, Top Boy continues to transcend its \u201cBritish-Wire\u201d roots. It isn\u2019t perfect \u2013 the Windrush/gentrification themes feel tacked-on \u2013 but it\u2019s not tired either. It remains a wild and terrible concrete western, blessed with note-perfect performances. On ITV, a new four-part Irish mystery drama Holding arrives brandishing robust credentials: it stars Conleth Hill (Game of Thrones; Dublin Murders), is written by Dominic Treadwell-Collins and Karen Cogan (adapting Graham Norton\u2019s well received 2016 novel) and directed by Kathy Burke, an actor who knows plenty about unshowy human truths.

Borissov, he said, had to make deals with \u201cthe oligarchy system\u201d to maintain power. By contrast, there had been \u201chuge hygiene\u201d about who could join the party he co-founded with fellow Harvard graduate Assen Vassilev, now the finance minister. \u201cWe are independent, we are starting clean, we are depending on nobody.\u201d</p> <p>Sitting at the EU table, Bulgaria will be championing democratic standards, he said. \u201cYou will see Bulgaria from now on speaking about the rule of law as a really strong proponent. The first thing is you should look at yourself and make sure you do your own work before pointing fingers.\u201d</p> <p>He questioned why it was Washington, rather than Sofia, that put sanctions on the Bulgarian oligarch, media mogul and political kingmaker, Delyan Peevski, who is alleged to have controlled Borissov from behind the scenes.</p> <p>The US described him as someone who \u201chas regularly engaged in corruption, using influence peddling and bribes to protect himself from public scrutiny and exert control over key institutions and sectors in Bulgarian society\u201d.</p> <p>Petkov said: \u201cI think we should be raising our eyebrows why somebody from 8,000km away could see more clearly significant acts of corruption.\u201d He located the blame in Sofia: \u201cFirst we have to look at why the prosecution in Bulgaria closed their eyes to this.\u201d</p> <p>Petkov wants Geshev to resign, although he has no power to make this happen.

      "bodyText": "Kiril Petkov is not a typical Bulgarian prime minister. The 41-year-old probiotics entrepreneur and Harvard Business School graduate is a political newcomer. He could not be more different to Boyko Borissov, the burly former bodyguard who dominated Bulgarian politics for 12 years, until he resigned last year after months-long street protests against corruption. After three general elections in eight months, Petkov\u2019s newly created We Continue the Change party swept to power at the head of a four-party coalition, vowing to tackle Bulgaria\u2019s most pernicious problem: corruption. Speaking to the Observer, Petkov said he wanted to eradicate corruption during his four-year term in office. \u201cI don\u2019t say decreasing corruption, I say full eradication,\u201d he said, adding that he hoped Bulgaria would be a textbook case of how corruption can be eliminated in a short time. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so hard. Bulgaria has 6.5 million people \u2013 it\u2019s not such a huge country \u2013 so what looks like an insurmountable task for a very large country, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the case for Bulgaria.\u201d He was speaking before police detained Borissov and reportedly searched his home on Thursday after the fledgling European public prosecutor\u2019s office announced it had opened 120 investigations into fraud involving EU funds in the country. Officials did not elaborate on the accusations against Borissov, who has faced allegations of corruption in the past and always denied wrongdoing. The decision by Bulgaria\u2019s chief prosecutor, Ivan Geshev, to release Borissov from custody without charge after saying he found procedural flaws, and that the former prime minister could not be detained further due to lack of evidence, prompted sharp criticism from the government. \u201cWe are faced with just the next sabotage on the part of the prosecution headed by Ivan Geshev,\u201d Petkov said. Speaking before Borissov\u2019s arrest, Petkov differentiated himself from his predecessor. Borissov, he said, had to make deals with \u201cthe oligarchy system\u201d to maintain power. By contrast, there had been \u201chuge hygiene\u201d about who could join the party he co-founded with fellow Harvard graduate Assen Vassilev, now the finance minister. \u201cWe are independent, we are starting clean, we are depending on nobody.\u201d Sitting at the EU table, Bulgaria will be championing democratic standards, he said. \u201cYou will see Bulgaria from now on speaking about the rule of law as a really strong proponent. The first thing is you should look at yourself and make sure you do your own work before pointing fingers.\u201d He questioned why it was Washington, rather than Sofia, that put sanctions on the Bulgarian oligarch, media mogul and political kingmaker, Delyan Peevski, who is alleged to have controlled Borissov from behind the scenes. The US described him as someone who \u201chas regularly engaged in corruption, using influence peddling and bribes to protect himself from public scrutiny and exert control over key institutions and sectors in Bulgarian society\u201d. Petkov said: \u201cI think we should be raising our eyebrows why somebody from 8,000km away could see more clearly significant acts of corruption.\u201d He located the blame in Sofia: \u201cFirst we have to look at why the prosecution in Bulgaria closed their eyes to this.\u201d Petkov wants Geshev to resign, although he has no power to make this happen. Last month, the prime minister handed Geshev a list of 19 individuals linked in media reports to high-level corruption and told prosecutors to do their job. Louisa Slavkova, director of the Sofia Platform, which promotes democracy, describes Petkov\u2019s decision to hand over names as unprecedented. \u201cThey [the government] have the capacity to focus on the toxic triangle between business, politics and media,\u201d she said. Daniel Smilov, at the Centre for Liberal Strategies in Sofia, said Petkov and his party had the \u201cpotential to turn the corner to make Bulgaria a country that is not systemically referred to as the most corrupt country\u201d in the EU. The problem for Petkov is that his original agenda has been \u201covertaken by all sorts of crises\u201d. Galloping inflation, lingering Covid \u2013 Bulgaria has the lowest EU vaccination rate \u2013 as well as war in Europe. Bulgaria does not share a land border with Ukraine but cannot avoid the ripple effects of the conflict in its neighbourhood. The war is a fraught issue for the coalition, as some members have been historically pro-Russia, although all have condemned the invasion. \u201cWhat unites them is their stance against the corrupt acts of the previous government, but when it comes to some of the other issues, there are tensions, to put it mildly,\u201d Smilov said. Earlier this month Bulgaria\u2019s defence minister, Stefan Yanev, was sacked after refusing to describe the Russian invasion as a war. Bulgaria has backed EU sanctions against Russia so far but opposes a ban on Russian oil and gas imports, a position also supported by Germany and Hungary. \u201cWe are the most dependent of the EU nations [on] Russian gas. Sometimes we are 100% dependent, which is staggering,\u201d Petkov said. He hopes to see a gas interconnector and long-delayed 182km pipeline connecting Bulgaria to Greece completed by the summer, bringing cheaper gas from Azerbaijan and breaking Russia\u2019s monopoly. While Bulgaria supports humanitarian aid and champions Ukraine\u2019s EU membership prospects, it has ruled out sending weapons. Despite Petkov\u2019s pro-EU credentials, Slavkova contends there is still ambiguity in the coalition\u2019s communication about Bulgaria\u2019s alliances, especially in the context of \u201ca media space that didn\u2019t take seriously the disinformation attempts by Russia for many years\u201d. She thinks Bulgaria is at a turning point comparable to the late 1990s when, after a decade of instability after the fall of the Berlin wall, the country chose a westward path. \u201cIt feels like a historical moment for a country like Bulgaria, it feels like we are at a point when we almost have to decide anew that we are part of Nato and the European Union.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Claudia Jessie Peyton, 31, was born in Birmingham and raised on a canal boat by her mother. She was home-schooled and has no formal qualifications but was talent-spotted while trying standup and recruited by a local theatre company. Her TV roles include <em>Line </em><em>of Duty</em>, <em>Doctor Who</em> and <em>Vanity Fair</em>. She plays Eloise, the eponymous family\u2019s second oldest daughter, in the hit Netflix period drama <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/bridgerton\">Bridgerton</a></em>, which returns on Friday.</p> <p><strong>Where do we find your character Eloise as </strong><em><strong>Bridgerton</strong></em><strong> returns?<br></strong>She\u2019s making her debut on the London social scene. Anyone who\u2019s a fan of the show can probably predict how she responds \u2013 with gritted teeth and many an eye roll. Eloise is only 18; I\u2019m 31 and can barely respond to text messages, let alone be presented to the Queen, then ultimately married off. Finding love isn\u2019t even in her top 10 list of desires. She wants autonomy, to earn her own money and make her own choices.</p> <p><strong>Is she a proto-feminist?<br></strong>Hers is the explicit feminist narrative throughout the piece. It\u2019s skilfully peppered throughout all the characters, with even the boys questioning their roles, but Eloise is the one who\u2019s got a megaphone, shouting: \u201cThis is rubbish!\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My mum cleaned houses to pay for my dance classes or music lessons. I\u2019m very aware of where I\u2019m from and how hard life can be</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>We see her reading </strong><strong>Mary Wollstonecraft</strong><strong> in the early episodes. Are you a bookworm too?<br></strong>I\u2019ve always had my head in a book. I\u2019ve just invested in a secondhand Kindle, in fact, because I live on a canal boat and I can\u2019t just keep adding to my book collection or we\u2019d sink.</p> <p><strong>What were your formative books?<br></strong>One of the first books I remember being given was <em>Little Women</em> by my nan. I read that six times in rapid succession. I\u2019m a member of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/extinction-rebellion\">Extinction Rebellion</a>, so went through a big <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/georgemonbiot\">George Monbiot</a> phase. I also read Japanese authors like Ryu Murakami. <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/mar/12/featuresreviews.guardianreview19\">In the Miso Soup</a></em> is the darkest novel I\u2019ve ever read. One chapter gave me palpitations.</p> <p><em><strong>Bridgerton</strong></em><strong> became Netflix\u2019s top show in 76 countries</strong><strong>. What\u2019s the appeal?<br></strong>It\u2019s not bleak or dark or intense. It\u2019s a bit of a cuddle. A sexy cuddle, mind you, but a cuddle nonetheless.</p> <p><strong>Will Eloise get her sexy moment?<br></strong>I wonder what that would be like? A sexy-but-funny montage, maybe. It would be cool to see Eloise awaken and get in touch with that side of herself. In season one, she didn\u2019t even know how babies were made.</p> <p><strong>Eloise is best friends with </strong><strong>Penelope Featherington</strong><strong>, played by </strong><strong>Nicola Coughlan</strong><strong>. What\u2019s your relationship like off-screen?<br></strong>Nicola always says it\u2019s the other way around. In <em>Bridgerton</em>, Eloise talks at Penelope a lot of the time; in real life, I\u2019m more introverted and Nicola does most of the chatting. We were the first two people cast. I remember seeing our head shots next to each other on a wall and thinking \u2013 \u201cCool!\u201d \u2013 because Nicola\u2019s incredible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31bea181acb60f8e4929a6ac9183d4acfd910c7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31bea181acb60f8e4929a6ac9183d4acfd910c7c/0_0_3600_2404/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Coughlan as Penelope Featherington, left, and Claudia Jessie as Eloise Bridgerton in Bridgerton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicola Coughlan as Penelope Featherington, left, and Claudia Jessie as Eloise Bridgerton in Bridgerton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liam Daniel/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Didn\u2019t Nicola stab you with a parasol during your first scene?<br></strong>Correct, she drew blood. Nicola had heels on and kept falling over. I tried to catch her and the silver spokes of the umbrella went bosh, straight into my hand. I managed to keep it away from my costume but bloodied my white glove. It was a blood oath. That\u2019s why we\u2019re so close now<em>.</em></p> <p><strong>What do you make of Eloise\u2019s big queer fanbase?<br></strong>I can see why she connects with people, because she\u2019s one of a kind within the show. She\u2019s quite modern, so closer to the audience in attitude and spirit. It\u2019s beautiful that the queer community identify with her. But I don\u2019t experience a lot of the love because I\u2019m not on social media.</p> <p><strong>Why not?<br></strong>It\u2019s my Kate Bush inclinations to be slightly reclusive. When I figured out I wanted to act, that became my mission. But there are parts of the industry that don\u2019t chime with my natural disposition. In order to maintain happiness, I have to eliminate certain things. With my anxious tendencies, it wouldn\u2019t bode well so I steer clear.</p> <p><strong>Eloise never looks comfortable in her finery but do you enjoy wearing the regency costumes?<br></strong>I mean, it\u2019s the nicest I\u2019ll ever look. I\u2019m not a fancy dresser at home. Living on a boat means I get covered in oil, coal, wood chips, dust, canal water, diesel. There\u2019s no point dressing up, so I love getting to do it on-set.</p> <p><strong>Is it true that you only wear second</strong><strong>hand clothes?<br></strong>It\u2019s six years since I shopped on the high street. I\u2019ll buy new underwear but ethically sourced and mostly recycled materials. Otherwise, it\u2019s strictly thrift and vintage shops.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the appeal of living on a boat?<br></strong>I loved it as a kid and that stuck with me. When I moved to London, I lived in various terrifying places, scraping money together for rent. I thought I\u2019d never get a mortgage for a house so started saving, slowly but surely, for a canal boat. It\u2019s one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made. I love cruising, the small spaces, the smell of the engine. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted.</p> <p><strong>You were raised by a working-class single mother. How did that shape you?<br></strong>It\u2019s about expectations. Mine were never high. I worked very hard but never expected to make it. Even now, I leave auditions and think: \u201cWell, I\u2019m clearly not going to get that.\u201d When I do, I\u2019m pleasantly surprised. My mum cleaned houses to pay for my dance classes or music lessons or my brother\u2019s activities. She\u2019d do anything so we could have a shot. I\u2019m very aware of where I\u2019m from and how hard life can be. That will never leave me. It\u2019s also made me a nester. I don\u2019t want for much; I love just pottering around on the boat.</p> <p><strong>How come you were home-schooled?<br></strong>School wasn\u2019t a nice environment for me; I had a hard time. I left at 14 and my poor mum home-schooled me while doing cleaning jobs. She\u2019d teach me maths while ironing someone else\u2019s clothes.

      "bodyText": "Claudia Jessie Peyton, 31, was born in Birmingham and raised on a canal boat by her mother. She was home-schooled and has no formal qualifications but was talent-spotted while trying standup and recruited by a local theatre company. Her TV roles include Line of Duty, Doctor Who and Vanity Fair. She plays Eloise, the eponymous family\u2019s second oldest daughter, in the hit Netflix period drama Bridgerton, which returns on Friday. Where do we find your character Eloise as Bridgerton returns? She\u2019s making her debut on the London social scene. Anyone who\u2019s a fan of the show can probably predict how she responds \u2013 with gritted teeth and many an eye roll. Eloise is only 18; I\u2019m 31 and can barely respond to text messages, let alone be presented to the Queen, then ultimately married off. Finding love isn\u2019t even in her top 10 list of desires. She wants autonomy, to earn her own money and make her own choices. Is she a proto-feminist? Hers is the explicit feminist narrative throughout the piece. It\u2019s skilfully peppered throughout all the characters, with even the boys questioning their roles, but Eloise is the one who\u2019s got a megaphone, shouting: \u201cThis is rubbish!\u201d We see her reading Mary Wollstonecraft in the early episodes. Are you a bookworm too? I\u2019ve always had my head in a book. I\u2019ve just invested in a secondhand Kindle, in fact, because I live on a canal boat and I can\u2019t just keep adding to my book collection or we\u2019d sink. What were your formative books? One of the first books I remember being given was Little Women by my nan. I read that six times in rapid succession. I\u2019m a member of Extinction Rebellion, so went through a big George Monbiot phase. I also read Japanese authors like Ryu Murakami. In the Miso Soup is the darkest novel I\u2019ve ever read. One chapter gave me palpitations. Bridgerton became Netflix\u2019s top show in 76 countries. What\u2019s the appeal? It\u2019s not bleak or dark or intense. It\u2019s a bit of a cuddle. A sexy cuddle, mind you, but a cuddle nonetheless. Will Eloise get her sexy moment? I wonder what that would be like? A sexy-but-funny montage, maybe. It would be cool to see Eloise awaken and get in touch with that side of herself. In season one, she didn\u2019t even know how babies were made. Eloise is best friends with Penelope Featherington, played by Nicola Coughlan. What\u2019s your relationship like off-screen? Nicola always says it\u2019s the other way around. In Bridgerton, Eloise talks at Penelope a lot of the time; in real life, I\u2019m more introverted and Nicola does most of the chatting. We were the first two people cast. I remember seeing our head shots next to each other on a wall and thinking \u2013 \u201cCool!\u201d \u2013 because Nicola\u2019s incredible. Didn\u2019t Nicola stab you with a parasol during your first scene? Correct, she drew blood. Nicola had heels on and kept falling over. I tried to catch her and the silver spokes of the umbrella went bosh, straight into my hand. I managed to keep it away from my costume but bloodied my white glove. It was a blood oath. That\u2019s why we\u2019re so close now. What do you make of Eloise\u2019s big queer fanbase? I can see why she connects with people, because she\u2019s one of a kind within the show. She\u2019s quite modern, so closer to the audience in attitude and spirit. It\u2019s beautiful that the queer community identify with her. But I don\u2019t experience a lot of the love because I\u2019m not on social media. Why not? It\u2019s my Kate Bush inclinations to be slightly reclusive. When I figured out I wanted to act, that became my mission. But there are parts of the industry that don\u2019t chime with my natural disposition. In order to maintain happiness, I have to eliminate certain things. With my anxious tendencies, it wouldn\u2019t bode well so I steer clear. Eloise never looks comfortable in her finery but do you enjoy wearing the regency costumes? I mean, it\u2019s the nicest I\u2019ll ever look. I\u2019m not a fancy dresser at home. Living on a boat means I get covered in oil, coal, wood chips, dust, canal water, diesel. There\u2019s no point dressing up, so I love getting to do it on-set. Is it true that you only wear secondhand clothes? It\u2019s six years since I shopped on the high street. I\u2019ll buy new underwear but ethically sourced and mostly recycled materials. Otherwise, it\u2019s strictly thrift and vintage shops. What\u2019s the appeal of living on a boat? I loved it as a kid and that stuck with me. When I moved to London, I lived in various terrifying places, scraping money together for rent. I thought I\u2019d never get a mortgage for a house so started saving, slowly but surely, for a canal boat. It\u2019s one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made. I love cruising, the small spaces, the smell of the engine. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted. You were raised by a working-class single mother. How did that shape you? It\u2019s about expectations. Mine were never high. I worked very hard but never expected to make it. Even now, I leave auditions and think: \u201cWell, I\u2019m clearly not going to get that.\u201d When I do, I\u2019m pleasantly surprised. My mum cleaned houses to pay for my dance classes or music lessons or my brother\u2019s activities. She\u2019d do anything so we could have a shot. I\u2019m very aware of where I\u2019m from and how hard life can be. That will never leave me. It\u2019s also made me a nester. I don\u2019t want for much; I love just pottering around on the boat. How come you were home-schooled? School wasn\u2019t a nice environment for me; I had a hard time. I left at 14 and my poor mum home-schooled me while doing cleaning jobs. She\u2019d teach me maths while ironing someone else\u2019s clothes. Remarkable, really, but I learned better one on one, away from social pressures. Is there a class gap in the acting profession? Growing up on a canal boat or council estate, I wasn\u2019t going to the theatre. An acting career never crossed my mind. It\u2019s hard to have beautiful dreams when you\u2019ve got to focus on earning money, paying rent and practicalities. But those voices are important. Expressing yourself and having an emotional outlet is so valuable. I didn\u2019t train, don\u2019t have any qualifications, didn\u2019t make all the right choices. It\u2019s against the odds that I\u2019m here now. You were Thandiwe Newton\u2019s sidekick, DC Jodie Taylor, in Line of Duty. How was that? When it aired, my friend sent me an article titled: Why DC Jodie Taylor is just the absolute worst! [laughs]. I love Thandiwe. We\u2019re still in contact and she\u2019s a beautiful woman. And I learned so much from Vicky McClure\u2019s ability to be so naturalistic. [Showrunner] Jed Mercurio would tell me: \u201cDon\u2019t really act, just say the words.\u201d That taught me to rein it in. What role does Buddhism play in your life? I\u2019m one of the noisy Buddhists. I don\u2019t meditate, I chant \u2013 \u201cNam Myoho Renge Kyo\u201d, the same as Tina Turner. Me and Tina T, no big deal.

      "bodyText": "Russian mercenaries fighting in Ukraine, including the Kremlin-backed Wagner Group, have been linked to far-right extremism including an organisation designated by the US as terrorist, analysis reveals. Although Vladimir Putin says his \u201cspecial military operation\u201d is aimed at the \u201cdenazification\u201d of Ukraine, an investigation has found links between pro-Russian forces and violent rightwing extremism, including those directly affiliated with Wagner. One post on the messaging app Telegram, dated 15 March, shows the flag of the Russian Imperial Movement (RIM), a white-supremacist paramilitary organisation which the US lists as terrorist, allegedly flown by Moscow-backed separatists in Donetsk. The post was shared by a pro-Putin channel. Much of the extremist content, posted on Telegram and the Russian social media platform VKontakte (VK), relates to a far-right unit within the Wagner Group called Rusich with others linked to pro-Kremlin online communities, some bearing the name and logo of Wagner Group. Adam Hadley, the executive director of Tech Against Terrorism, a London-based initiative supported by the UN counter-terrorism executive directorate, said their analysis indicated that Russian-backed forces in Ukraine, including the Wagner Group, are \u201calmost certainly connected with extreme far-right organisations\u201d. Hadley added: \u201cGiven Putin\u2019s absurd demands for the \u2018denazification\u2019 of Ukraine, we suggest he should first root out neo-Nazis in his own ranks before pointing the finger at others.\u201d One of the most secretive organisations in Russia, the Wagner Group doesn\u2019t officially exist. However, reports suggest hundreds of its members are fighting in Ukraine with claims shortly after the invasion that its mercenaries were operating in Kyiv with orders from the Kremlin to assassinate the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. It is also understood that efforts are being made by private messaging groups in Russia to recruit a new brigade of mercenaries to fight in Ukraine. Recently, the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, announced that 16,000 fighters from the Middle East had volunteered to fight with the Russian army. One account on VK is dedicated to the Rusich \u201csabotage and assault reconnaissance group\u201d which appears to be operating in Ukraine, according to a post on 17 March. The Rusich logo features a Slavic Swastika known as a Kolovrat. Another recent VK posting lists Rusich as part of a coalition of separatist groups and militias including the extreme far-right group, Russian National Unity. One image shared on VK by a Rusich-affiliated account shows fighters, seemingly in Ukraine although it has proved impossible to verify, holding a Valknut flag, a symbol also commonly appropriated by white supremacists. It has been reported that mercenary units recruited to Wagner are being given names like \u201cThe Hawks\u201d, possibly to steer away from the group\u2019s reputation after repeated accusations of human rights abuses in its operations in Syria and Libya. The Tech Against Terrorism analysis found a prominent Wagner Group-affiliated Telegram channel sharing an image in May 2021 of the Kolovrat allegedly daubed on a cliff in Palmyra, Syria. It also found Telegram channels \u2013 named \u201cWagner PMC\u201d in Russian \u2013 sharing footage and memes as recently as 4 March relating to the torture and beheading of a Syrian captive by Wagner mercenaries in 2017. The Wagner group was first identified in 2014, when backing pro-Russian separatists in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. It is owned by Yevgeny Prigozhin, one of Putin\u2019s closest allies, and has since conducted covert operations across Africa and the Middle East. Military experts believe that mercenaries allow the Kremlin \u2013 which has always denied any links with mercenary groups \u2013 to keep its death toll down. In an effort to control its narrative, Russia recently opened a criminal case against Facebook\u2019s owner, Meta, accusing it of being an extremist organisation. The move by Russian prosecutors came after the the US tech giant temporarily allowed the use of terms such as \u201cdeath to the Russian invaders\u201d. Hadley added: \u201cWe condemn Russia for weaponising terrorism in this way and subverting international counter-terrorism norms.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It must have been heaven to be alive and watching dance in New York from the late 1960s until the early 1980s, when a group of young choreographers \u2013 Lucinda Childs, Steve Paxton, Yvonne Rainer and Trisha Brown among them \u2013 came together in the basement of the Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village and rethought the nature of dance.</p> <p>I went there on my first trip to New York, to pay homage, and was rather surprised to find it was still just a church. I wanted plaques and statues and celebratory fireworks. Now, I just eagerly await revivals of the work, marvelling at the clarity and beauty their experiments unlocked.</p> <p>Because of their collaborations with other pioneers, the dance-makers came to represent an entire artistic avant garde and so their work often ends up in museums and galleries nowadays. Tate Modern is <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern/display/tanks/set-and-reset-trisha-brown\">hosting an exhibition</a> centred on Trisha Brown\u2019s 1983 creation of <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4juID0hSyaw\">Set and Reset,</a></em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4juID0hSyaw\"> </a>with set and costumes by Robert Rauschenberg, score by Laurie Anderson and lighting by Beverly Emmons.</p> <p>Around the display, a sequence of performances is being staged as part of the <a href=\"https://www.dancereflections-vancleefarpels.com/en/london-festival\">Dance Reflections</a> festival. In the coming week, <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/set-and-reset-reset\">Candoco will present</a> its version of this seminal work, but first up it was Rambert\u2019s dancers who recreated its shimmering movement, full of little details of arched or slashing arms and stretched feet, but giving the sense of constant, serene flow.</p> <p>In addition to the structures floating over the action \u2013 a cube and two pyramids on to which a stream of black-and-white American news footage is projected \u2013 Rauschenberg provided gorgeous, floaty costumes. The whole effect is as fresh and wondrous as the day it was made; it lasts less than 30 minutes yet is so rich in scope and shape you could watch it for ever.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f76e47924b19b382b55f71ad14f3cbc7e67b2a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f76e47924b19b382b55f71ad14f3cbc7e67b2a7/0_303_7737_4641/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from Christian Rizzo\u2019s une maison: \u2018stubbornly opaque\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from Christian Rizzo\u2019s une maison: \u2018stubbornly opaque\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Domage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The contemporary contributions from Dance Reflections<a href=\"https://www.sadlerswells.com/dance-reflections-van-cleef-and-arpels/\">,</a> however, both seemed to turn down blind alleys. There\u2019s something mesmeric about Katerina Andreou\u2019s <em>BSTRD,</em> in which the dancer walks on, puts a skull-shatteringly loud techno soundtrack on a turntable and then starts to dance, in endlessly repetitive sequences of hops, skips, runs. Watching feels a bit like standing at a bar at a rave: exhausting, frustrating, not really going anywhere.</p> <p>But at least Andreou seems to have some sense of purpose. Christian Rizzo\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.sadlerswells.com/whats-on/christian-rizzo-une-maison/\">une maison</a></em> remains stubbornly opaque. A cast of 14 group themselves into various tableaux; sometimes, they appear in animal masks; sometimes, they move vigorously; more often, they are still, heads resting often on each others\u2019 shoulders. They change their clothes from greys to colours. The stage is dominated by a large, florescent light sculpture whose tubes intermittently judder into movement, altering the shape.

      "bodyText": "It must have been heaven to be alive and watching dance in New York from the late 1960s until the early 1980s, when a group of young choreographers \u2013 Lucinda Childs, Steve Paxton, Yvonne Rainer and Trisha Brown among them \u2013 came together in the basement of the Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village and rethought the nature of dance. I went there on my first trip to New York, to pay homage, and was rather surprised to find it was still just a church. I wanted plaques and statues and celebratory fireworks. Now, I just eagerly await revivals of the work, marvelling at the clarity and beauty their experiments unlocked. Because of their collaborations with other pioneers, the dance-makers came to represent an entire artistic avant garde and so their work often ends up in museums and galleries nowadays. Tate Modern is hosting an exhibition centred on Trisha Brown\u2019s 1983 creation of Set and Reset, with set and costumes by Robert Rauschenberg, score by Laurie Anderson and lighting by Beverly Emmons. Around the display, a sequence of performances is being staged as part of the Dance Reflections festival. In the coming week, Candoco will present its version of this seminal work, but first up it was Rambert\u2019s dancers who recreated its shimmering movement, full of little details of arched or slashing arms and stretched feet, but giving the sense of constant, serene flow. In addition to the structures floating over the action \u2013 a cube and two pyramids on to which a stream of black-and-white American news footage is projected \u2013 Rauschenberg provided gorgeous, floaty costumes. The whole effect is as fresh and wondrous as the day it was made; it lasts less than 30 minutes yet is so rich in scope and shape you could watch it for ever. The contemporary contributions from Dance Reflections, however, both seemed to turn down blind alleys. There\u2019s something mesmeric about Katerina Andreou\u2019s BSTRD, in which the dancer walks on, puts a skull-shatteringly loud techno soundtrack on a turntable and then starts to dance, in endlessly repetitive sequences of hops, skips, runs. Watching feels a bit like standing at a bar at a rave: exhausting, frustrating, not really going anywhere. But at least Andreou seems to have some sense of purpose. Christian Rizzo\u2019s une maison remains stubbornly opaque. A cast of 14 group themselves into various tableaux; sometimes, they appear in animal masks; sometimes, they move vigorously; more often, they are still, heads resting often on each others\u2019 shoulders. They change their clothes from greys to colours. The stage is dominated by a large, florescent light sculpture whose tubes intermittently judder into movement, altering the shape. There\u2019s a pile of dust that gets thrown across the stage and went in my eyes and hair. I think it is about home, and homelessness, and friendship, but I really didn\u2019t care. If Trisha Brown\u2019s fleet movement represents contemporary dance at its most generous, this work by Rizzo seems deliberately alienating.

You could see him in close-up, as if he were deliberately staring into the camera. He wears a face mask, gloves, a sports jacket, polo-neck sweater and beanie hat. He looks through the letter box then turns to survey the street before removing a flat object \u2013 perhaps a credit card \u2013 from his jacket pocket. He takes about 15 seconds to open the door.</p> <p>It was rather like in a TV drama when a burglar fiddles mysteriously with a keyhole and the next moment he\u2019s in. I\u2019d always thought that was artistic licence, assuming the job of picking or jemmying a modern lock was a far lengthier business. I was wrong.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not hard to get the impression that there\u2019s a malevolent army working day and night to walk off with your property</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cDo you know this man?\u201d the poster asks, understandably upset at being burgled. You can\u2019t see much of his face, but you can see he is black. There are no explicit racial comments, but one poster writes: \u201cHis whole ugly face is distinctive to me. He looks like he is capable of anything.\u201d</p> <p>How do you moderate that? Another poster asks if it\u2019s worth contacting a local paper. Of course, local papers used to be the medium through which people were alerted to crimes in their locality. Despite vivid, sometimes lurid, reports, they were and are constrained by journalistic guidelines, libel law and sub judice. In a way, social media networks like Nextdoor have replaced the role of local papers, delivering news almost as it happens, with instantaneous, unedited feedback.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03d81248eb70d7e92c900842d5446bbfe83c1b79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03d81248eb70d7e92c900842d5446bbfe83c1b79/0_155_3936_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Missing cats are also advertised on the platform.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Whitaker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Richard Osley, editor of the award-winning <em>Camden New Journal</em>, says: \u201cThere is an issue with the fact that the uploads on the app do not seem to be bound by any fear of libel risk. We could not operate in the same way. You see serious accusations made without the same rigour you\u2019d expect from a team of journalists.\u201d</p> <p>Another recent post on my group claimed to be gathering a legal challenge to a local GP practice. People piled in, most with their own nightmare stories of neglect and incompetence, naming specific doctors. The post was eventually removed, but not before some grave allegations were made.</p> <p>As Osley argues, if people seek their news from what is essentially street gossip and \u201cnobody does the basic requirement of investigation and holding institutions to account \u2013 something Nextdoor can\u2019t really do \u2013 then we will all be losers in the end\u201d.</p> <p>That may be true, yet in an obvious sense Nextdoor is also an empowering tool. To be forewarned is to be forearmed, and the strength of numbers of neighbourhood users may help prevent a victim of a burglary from feeling isolated, particularly as there is little chance the police will be interested.</p> <p>But at the same time, the weight of participating voices can be misleading and distorting, as each person adds unverifiable anecdotes and contributes to what can sometimes seem like a vigilante clamour.</p> <p>In another case on my group, a poster put up a video of a would-be burglar who came to his door but failed to gain access. He notes that had he broken in, he would have been confronted by two mastiffs. Other posters take up the theme. \u201cKill! Go Mastiffs!\u201d one comments, and many echo the sentiment. When a lone poster says the guy may have mental health problems, she is swiftly told: \u201cMental health or not, I catch him doing that outside my house and I will smash him to pieces.\u201d</p> <p>A lot of this, no doubt, is letting off steam, a safety-valve for the angst of city life. But even so, it\u2019s hard to fit it into the corporate narrative of cultivating kindness. Indeed, you could argue that Nextdoor is cultivating the very things it purports to challenge: hatred, bigotry, fear and suspicion. After all, no one ever went broke by stirring up that particular set of emotions. Which brings us to the business end of Nextdoor\u2019s operation. Set up by a group of Silicon Valley tech entrepreneurs with venture capital backing, Nextdoor was valued last year at $4.3bn. The platform\u2019s revenue comes from advertising \u2013 security systems feature prominently, along with local services.</p> <p>In that final quarter announcement that came with the \u201ckinder world\u201d message, total revenue was $59m, up almost 50% year-on-year, and a public offering realised a cash balance of over $700m. The phrase <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/06/toronto-smart-city-google-project-privacy-concerns\" title=\"\">\u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d</a> takes on another meaning here, with revenue being generated not as a consequence of digital companies spying on people so much as from people spying on each other.</p> <p>That Nextdoor is a player with ambitions to rival the largest social media outfits is underlined by last year\u2019s decision from Facebook (now Meta) to launch Facebook Neighbourhoods, which replicates many of Nextdoor\u2019s features. For Nextdoor to triumph over Meta, says Ashplant, it will need to continue growing users in a post-pandemic world and show it can turn a profit. To do this, he says, it will have \u201cto prove it is able to effectively police misinformation and retain trust\u201d.</p> <p>While communities evolve over time, they can also be rapidly affected by new social conditions. Like Facebook and Twitter, Nextdoor is inherently disruptive. Such platforms become part of contemporary life by displacing previous systems, customs and habits.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/17/rowan-williams-uk-wealth-tax-inequality-archbishop-rich-poor\">Rowan Williams calls for UK wealth tax to tackle \u2018spiralling inequality\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In recent years in this country, mirroring more advanced trends in America, there has been a growing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/17/rowan-williams-uk-wealth-tax-inequality-archbishop-rich-poor\" title=\"\">separation between the rich and the poor</a>, a process whose logical conclusion is economic segregation, with the wealthy cut off and securely protected from the supposedly dangerous world beyond.</p> <p>It has been claimed in America that Nextdoor is most active in neighbourhoods not badly afflicted by crime, but in which there is an exaggerated fear of it. The company maintains that the network is used across all communities. Whatever the truth, a healthy community steadfastness against crime is easily parlayed into hostility towards strangers, outsiders, minorities, the poor and the mentally ill.</p> <p>In turn, that hostility can create a virtual gated community that, sooner or later, leads to the real thing. It\u2019s a cycle that may prove profitable for the well-heeled and well-protected, and for those who service them, but it\u2019s unlikely to make for a kinder world.</p>",

As Osley argues, if people seek their news from what is essentially street gossip and \u201cnobody does the basic requirement of investigation and holding institutions to account \u2013 something Nextdoor can\u2019t really do \u2013 then we will all be losers in the end\u201d. That may be true, yet in an obvious sense Nextdoor is also an empowering tool. To be forewarned is to be forearmed, and the strength of numbers of neighbourhood users may help prevent a victim of a burglary from feeling isolated, particularly as there is little chance the police will be interested. But at the same time, the weight of participating voices can be misleading and distorting, as each person adds unverifiable anecdotes and contributes to what can sometimes seem like a vigilante clamour. In another case on my group, a poster put up a video of a would-be burglar who came to his door but failed to gain access. He notes that had he broken in, he would have been confronted by two mastiffs. Other posters take up the theme. \u201cKill! Go Mastiffs!\u201d one comments, and many echo the sentiment. When a lone poster says the guy may have mental health problems, she is swiftly told: \u201cMental health or not, I catch him doing that outside my house and I will smash him to pieces.\u201d A lot of this, no doubt, is letting off steam, a safety-valve for the angst of city life. But even so, it\u2019s hard to fit it into the corporate narrative of cultivating kindness. Indeed, you could argue that Nextdoor is cultivating the very things it purports to challenge: hatred, bigotry, fear and suspicion. After all, no one ever went broke by stirring up that particular set of emotions. Which brings us to the business end of Nextdoor\u2019s operation. Set up by a group of Silicon Valley tech entrepreneurs with venture capital backing, Nextdoor was valued last year at $4.3bn. The platform\u2019s revenue comes from advertising \u2013 security systems feature prominently, along with local services. In that final quarter announcement that came with the \u201ckinder world\u201d message, total revenue was $59m, up almost 50% year-on-year, and a public offering realised a cash balance of over $700m. The phrase \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d takes on another meaning here, with revenue being generated not as a consequence of digital companies spying on people so much as from people spying on each other. That Nextdoor is a player with ambitions to rival the largest social media outfits is underlined by last year\u2019s decision from Facebook (now Meta) to launch Facebook Neighbourhoods, which replicates many of Nextdoor\u2019s features. For Nextdoor to triumph over Meta, says Ashplant, it will need to continue growing users in a post-pandemic world and show it can turn a profit. To do this, he says, it will have \u201cto prove it is able to effectively police misinformation and retain trust\u201d. While communities evolve over time, they can also be rapidly affected by new social conditions. Like Facebook and Twitter, Nextdoor is inherently disruptive. Such platforms become part of contemporary life by displacing previous systems, customs and habits. In recent years in this country, mirroring more advanced trends in America, there has been a growing separation between the rich and the poor, a process whose logical conclusion is economic segregation, with the wealthy cut off and securely protected from the supposedly dangerous world beyond. It has been claimed in America that Nextdoor is most active in neighbourhoods not badly afflicted by crime, but in which there is an exaggerated fear of it. The company maintains that the network is used across all communities. Whatever the truth, a healthy community steadfastness against crime is easily parlayed into hostility towards strangers, outsiders, minorities, the poor and the mentally ill. In turn, that hostility can create a virtual gated community that, sooner or later, leads to the real thing. It\u2019s a cycle that may prove profitable for the well-heeled and well-protected, and for those who service them, but it\u2019s unlikely to make for a kinder world.",

      "body": "<p>I first encountered Ingrid Pollard\u2019s photography in a 2017 retrospective of Britain\u2019s Black arts movement in Nottingham \u2013 a moment when the aftershocks of the Brexit referendum were still fresh, Trump was new, the English Defence League was on the up and Whitehall officials were describing their vision for Britain\u2019s global relations<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/07/building-brexit-on-myth-of-empire-ignores-history-at-our-peril\"> as \u201cEmpire 2.0\u201d</a>. Faced by such a void of political imagination, it felt vital in that moment to look to the work of artists such as Pollard, Sonia Boyce, Keith Piper, Lubaina Himid and Eddie Chambers, who since the early 1980s have been exploring creative ways to stand up to white supremacy from a specifically British point of view. Pollard\u2019s unique contribution to that movement, a beacon for Black engagement with Britain\u2019s rural geography, quickly found a special resonance with me.</p> <p>Pollard is best known for her work in portraiture and landscape photography. In projects including <em><a href=\"http://www.ingridpollard.com/the-cost-of-the-english-landscape.html\">The Cost of the English Landscape</a> </em>(1989) and <em>Seventeen of Sixty Eight</em> (2019), she questions received ideas of Englishness and brings what Baroness Lola Young has called \u201csimplicity and complexity\u201d to themes of place, race, nation and sexuality.</p> <p>Pollard decided, around a year ago, to break with London life and moved to Highgreen, Northumberland. We had planned to do our interview \u2013 to discuss her first career retrospective, at MK gallery in Milton Keynes \u2013 there, against the backdrop of Pollard\u2019s new life in the north of England. But about a week before, she has a change of heart: \u201cI\u2019ve only just moved here,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s not really my home.\u201d So instead, we meet at a cafe near Lea Rowing Club in Hackney, not far from Pollard\u2019s first home in Britain, where she lived after her family migrated from Guyana in 1956.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5ef6a3cc88d4c1cb85e48ef93b09e9ae6ec1d33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5ef6a3cc88d4c1cb85e48ef93b09e9ae6ec1d33/0_0_5560_4953/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pastoral Interlude, 1987.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"891\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pastoral Interlude, 1987.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the opposite bank of the river from the rowing club, beyond the canal boats and Springfield marina, the Walthamstow marshes open out, a haven for waterbirds and dragonflies. In 1970, as part of an O-level geography fieldwork assignment and using her dad\u2019s camera, Pollard conducted her first photography project<strong> </strong>here \u2013 on the industrial decline of the Lea Valley. \u201cIt\u2019s an important landscape in my life,\u201d she says. As we begin to talk, I sense that the decision to meet in London may be because Pollard wants to avoid being painted as a stranger in an unfamiliar landscape. This is a common caricature, she says, based on the misreading of a work made nearly 40 years ago.</p> <p>That piece is her most famous work \u2013 <em><a href=\"http://www.ingridpollard.com/pastoral-interlude.html\">Pastoral Interlude</a> </em><em>\u2013</em> a series of image-text compositions, made between 1982 and 1987, that pairs photographs of young Black people working or walking in English rural environments with words that sit in uneasy tension with the images. A photographer leans against a dry stone wall, rewinding her film. A naturalist collects specimens from a river. A young man wanders playfully through a churchyard. Beneath the images, the words point towards things you can\u2019t exactly see \u2013 histories of empire and slavery, intimations of dread or vulnerability: \u201cI wandered lonely as a Black face in a sea of white,\u201d reads one of these texts; \u201csearching for sea-shells, waves lap my wellington boots, carrying lost souls of brothers and sisters over the ship side\u201d, says another. Viewing them is a complex experience that, as someone who both inhabits and objects to aspects of English identity, feels familiar to me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7dd0e3ce2db6f7e80c965b233137edfbb0c05de2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7dd0e3ce2db6f7e80c965b233137edfbb0c05de2/0_0_2816_3432/821.jpg\" alt=\"Dehisence \u2013 passing through the interstices of membrane, 2001.\" width=\"821\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dehisence \u2013 passing through the interstices of membrane, 2001.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A 2015 article by the writer Robert Macfarlane exemplifies, Pollard says, what irks her about the misreading. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/10/eeriness-english-countryside-robert-macfarlane\">Writing</a> about the \u201ceeriness\u201d of the English countryside, Macfarlane cites <em>Pastoral Interlude</em> and assumes that it is Pollard herself who \u201cwanders lonely as a Black cloud\u2026\u201d. This is wrong, says Pollard. \u201cIt\u2019s not a caption.

At the time, she was with her friend Anita Jones, one of the models in the photographs.

It\u2019s about white landscape, Black people. It\u2019s eerie,\u2019\u201d Pollard continues. \u201cIt gets bashed into whatever shape people want to put it in.\u201d By contrast, she sees that piece and her own work more broadly as reflecting a lifelong engagement with the British landscape in all its complexity. Referring to an image from the series where Anita Jones sits, camera in hand, on a dry stone wall, Pollard tells me to turn my attention towards the fencing, the hedgerows and the hilltops behind her: \u201cLook at that landscape,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a managed landscape, the trees have been taken away, there are dry stone walls, there are sheep. Everything about it is fabricated for industrial rural use. The barbed wire, the telegraph pole, the tarmac. Stereotypes about Black people are constructed in exactly the same way.\u201d</p> <p>For Pollard, the work exposes prevailing myths about the English landscape and Englishness: \u201cPeople want me to say that I\u2019m alienated because then they can say: \u2018Oh, I understand that. Black people should be in the Caribbean or Africa, that\u2019s where they came from.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It wasn\u2019t about getting an exhibition at the Tate.

Racism, she is keen to emphasise, is a response she has experienced in the English countryside, but also in \u201cLondon, Belfast, Poland\u201d.

      "bodyText": "I first encountered Ingrid Pollard\u2019s photography in a 2017 retrospective of Britain\u2019s Black arts movement in Nottingham \u2013 a moment when the aftershocks of the Brexit referendum were still fresh, Trump was new, the English Defence League was on the up and Whitehall officials were describing their vision for Britain\u2019s global relations as \u201cEmpire 2.0\u201d. Faced by such a void of political imagination, it felt vital in that moment to look to the work of artists such as Pollard, Sonia Boyce, Keith Piper, Lubaina Himid and Eddie Chambers, who since the early 1980s have been exploring creative ways to stand up to white supremacy from a specifically British point of view. Pollard\u2019s unique contribution to that movement, a beacon for Black engagement with Britain\u2019s rural geography, quickly found a special resonance with me. Pollard is best known for her work in portraiture and landscape photography. In projects including The Cost of the English Landscape (1989) and Seventeen of Sixty Eight (2019), she questions received ideas of Englishness and brings what Baroness Lola Young has called \u201csimplicity and complexity\u201d to themes of place, race, nation and sexuality. Pollard decided, around a year ago, to break with London life and moved to Highgreen, Northumberland. We had planned to do our interview \u2013 to discuss her first career retrospective, at MK gallery in Milton Keynes \u2013 there, against the backdrop of Pollard\u2019s new life in the north of England. But about a week before, she has a change of heart: \u201cI\u2019ve only just moved here,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s not really my home.\u201d So instead, we meet at a cafe near Lea Rowing Club in Hackney, not far from Pollard\u2019s first home in Britain, where she lived after her family migrated from Guyana in 1956. On the opposite bank of the river from the rowing club, beyond the canal boats and Springfield marina, the Walthamstow marshes open out, a haven for waterbirds and dragonflies. In 1970, as part of an O-level geography fieldwork assignment and using her dad\u2019s camera, Pollard conducted her first photography project here \u2013 on the industrial decline of the Lea Valley. \u201cIt\u2019s an important landscape in my life,\u201d she says. As we begin to talk, I sense that the decision to meet in London may be because Pollard wants to avoid being painted as a stranger in an unfamiliar landscape. This is a common caricature, she says, based on the misreading of a work made nearly 40 years ago. That piece is her most famous work \u2013 Pastoral Interlude \u2013 a series of image-text compositions, made between 1982 and 1987, that pairs photographs of young Black people working or walking in English rural environments with words that sit in uneasy tension with the images. A photographer leans against a dry stone wall, rewinding her film. A naturalist collects specimens from a river. A young man wanders playfully through a churchyard. Beneath the images, the words point towards things you can\u2019t exactly see \u2013 histories of empire and slavery, intimations of dread or vulnerability: \u201cI wandered lonely as a Black face in a sea of white,\u201d reads one of these texts; \u201csearching for sea-shells, waves lap my wellington boots, carrying lost souls of brothers and sisters over the ship side\u201d, says another. Viewing them is a complex experience that, as someone who both inhabits and objects to aspects of English identity, feels familiar to me. A 2015 article by the writer Robert Macfarlane exemplifies, Pollard says, what irks her about the misreading. Writing about the \u201ceeriness\u201d of the English countryside, Macfarlane cites Pastoral Interlude and assumes that it is Pollard herself who \u201cwanders lonely as a Black cloud\u2026\u201d. This is wrong, says Pollard. \u201cIt\u2019s not a caption. [The text and the image] are meant to be in opposition.\u201d She recalls the days spent in Derbyshire taking these images as a time of pleasure. At the time, she was with her friend Anita Jones, one of the models in the photographs. They were taking a little break before heading on to the first Black Arts Convention in Wolverhampton: \u201cThey\u2019re holiday snaps,\u201d Pollard insists. \u201cPeople are happy in those photographs.\u201d \u201cPeople immediately say [about Pastoral Interlude]: \u2018It\u2019s about alienation. It\u2019s about white landscape, Black people. It\u2019s eerie,\u2019\u201d Pollard continues. \u201cIt gets bashed into whatever shape people want to put it in.\u201d By contrast, she sees that piece and her own work more broadly as reflecting a lifelong engagement with the British landscape in all its complexity. Referring to an image from the series where Anita Jones sits, camera in hand, on a dry stone wall, Pollard tells me to turn my attention towards the fencing, the hedgerows and the hilltops behind her: \u201cLook at that landscape,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a managed landscape, the trees have been taken away, there are dry stone walls, there are sheep.

      "body": "<p>Have you been enjoying the sunshine? Perhaps that\u2019s a redundant question: it has been difficult to avoid the delicious grins on people\u2019s faces, the exaggerated generosity in their manners, the readiness to smile at strangers. Even the traditionally uptight denizens of London have been seen to unfurrow their brows and actually catch each other\u2019s eye. Something feels different. Something feels \u2013 and forgive me if I\u2019m speaking out of place here \u2013 not completely awful.</p> <p>Nature\u2019s good at that, of course. Give the lady her due, she always turns it around at the end of winter. In this part of the northern hemisphere we spend a good third of a year convinced that the world is cold, dark and possibly going to hell in a handcart, then out pop the daffodils and it\u2019s like someone\u2019s thrown us a surprise party but remembered only to invite our more cheerful, better behaved alter egos.</p> <p>Last week\u2019s sudden transformation \u2013 the rocketing of temperatures from the bitter bottom of the thermometer, the dialling up of colour across sun, sky and surroundings, as if a nine-year-old got loose with the Insta filters \u2013 has felt more welcome than ever. None of us expected to emerge from the pandemic only to face, immediately, the terrifying horror of war in Europe. Against the grim grey images of smoking buildings that have dominated our thoughts and wrung our hearts for the past three weeks, the blossom and bulbs have, perhaps, seemed to bud more brightly than usual.</p> <p>The atmosphere of relief and release, in public spaces, has been palpable. Here was life finally giving us the smallest of breaks. Yes, you\u2019d just received the email warning that your energy bills were about to go up by 100% \u2013 but just for a couple of days, you could turn the central heating off, and maybe even shed a layer.</p> <p>The streets were filled with unexpected sounds. The barely remembered noise of pubgoers spilling out on to the pavements for their after-work drink, and the tinkle of the never-too-soon-for-ice-cream van. The thrum of convertibles, decanted from the garage at the first opportunity. The creep of free-floating jazz covers from buskers who can at last dare to play without their instruments freezing to their fingers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It does feel like the gradual, groggy, return to reality after an all-consuming bad dream</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We\u2019ve been here before, of course. Two pandemic springs and summers have offered similar moments of collective relief. Everyone is wiser now, experienced enough to appreciate that one government minister\u2019s back-to-normal is another government scientist\u2019s false dawn.</p> <p>And, yet, there are genuine grounds for hope added to the mixture this time. The latest data collected in England shows that a case of Covid now carries a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e26c93a0-90e7-4dec-a796-3e25e94bc59b\" title=\"\">smaller risk of death</a> than a flu infection, thanks partly to the less harmful effects of Omicron and partly to the population\u2019s increasing immunity. There\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/abb2f882-0eff-42df-969a-a02f22f3a4a1\" title=\"\">a notable increase</a> in people\u2019s confidence to mix indoors, and a visible decrease in the numbers of masks and face coverings we see on a daily basis. This is, without doubt, the closest that things have felt to the life we knew in 2019.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t have the feeling of a breakthrough, precisely, but it does feel like the gradual, groggy return to reality after an all-consuming bad dream. In fact, like a dream, some of us are already struggling to entirely inhabit the memories of what we\u2019ve just been through. Last week, I visited my local library for the first time since it reopened, and the librarian told me that he couldn\u2019t remember huge swathes of the past two years, whether because they were too nondescript or too traumatic to recall he wasn\u2019t sure.</p> <p>Arriving back home, I bumped into a neighbour, and we talked about the sunshine and the fact we\u2019d both be out in our gardens soon.

      "bodyText": "Have you been enjoying the sunshine? Perhaps that\u2019s a redundant question: it has been difficult to avoid the delicious grins on people\u2019s faces, the exaggerated generosity in their manners, the readiness to smile at strangers. Even the traditionally uptight denizens of London have been seen to unfurrow their brows and actually catch each other\u2019s eye. Something feels different. Something feels \u2013 and forgive me if I\u2019m speaking out of place here \u2013 not completely awful. Nature\u2019s good at that, of course. Give the lady her due, she always turns it around at the end of winter. In this part of the northern hemisphere we spend a good third of a year convinced that the world is cold, dark and possibly going to hell in a handcart, then out pop the daffodils and it\u2019s like someone\u2019s thrown us a surprise party but remembered only to invite our more cheerful, better behaved alter egos. Last week\u2019s sudden transformation \u2013 the rocketing of temperatures from the bitter bottom of the thermometer, the dialling up of colour across sun, sky and surroundings, as if a nine-year-old got loose with the Insta filters \u2013 has felt more welcome than ever. None of us expected to emerge from the pandemic only to face, immediately, the terrifying horror of war in Europe. Against the grim grey images of smoking buildings that have dominated our thoughts and wrung our hearts for the past three weeks, the blossom and bulbs have, perhaps, seemed to bud more brightly than usual. The atmosphere of relief and release, in public spaces, has been palpable. Here was life finally giving us the smallest of breaks. Yes, you\u2019d just received the email warning that your energy bills were about to go up by 100% \u2013 but just for a couple of days, you could turn the central heating off, and maybe even shed a layer. The streets were filled with unexpected sounds. The barely remembered noise of pubgoers spilling out on to the pavements for their after-work drink, and the tinkle of the never-too-soon-for-ice-cream van. The thrum of convertibles, decanted from the garage at the first opportunity. The creep of free-floating jazz covers from buskers who can at last dare to play without their instruments freezing to their fingers. We\u2019ve been here before, of course. Two pandemic springs and summers have offered similar moments of collective relief. Everyone is wiser now, experienced enough to appreciate that one government minister\u2019s back-to-normal is another government scientist\u2019s false dawn. And, yet, there are genuine grounds for hope added to the mixture this time. The latest data collected in England shows that a case of Covid now carries a smaller risk of death than a flu infection, thanks partly to the less harmful effects of Omicron and partly to the population\u2019s increasing immunity. There\u2019s a notable increase in people\u2019s confidence to mix indoors, and a visible decrease in the numbers of masks and face coverings we see on a daily basis. This is, without doubt, the closest that things have felt to the life we knew in 2019. It doesn\u2019t have the feeling of a breakthrough, precisely, but it does feel like the gradual, groggy return to reality after an all-consuming bad dream. In fact, like a dream, some of us are already struggling to entirely inhabit the memories of what we\u2019ve just been through. Last week, I visited my local library for the first time since it reopened, and the librarian told me that he couldn\u2019t remember huge swathes of the past two years, whether because they were too nondescript or too traumatic to recall he wasn\u2019t sure. Arriving back home, I bumped into a neighbour, and we talked about the sunshine and the fact we\u2019d both be out in our gardens soon. We remembered Brian, the presiding spirit of our street, whose life had been claimed by Covid at the start of 2021. We talked of my neighbour\u2019s mother, who died of the virus earlier this year, and of the lifelong friend I had lost, and the household we knew just up the road that had buried three members of their family. It was strange to observe, a little impassively, how our communal history is already absorbing such extensive losses. The that-was-then unreality of empty skies and specially built Nightingale hospitals may be receding from our outer consciousness, but there\u2019s still plenty around to stoke our internal fears, whether that\u2019s the invasion of Ukraine or rising costs of living. Statistics from the ONS show that adults in the UK are still reporting high levels of anxiety in their daily life; since the end of February, almost in line with Putin\u2019s acts of aggression, those levels have begun to climb again, while overall happiness levels have fallen. We know \u2013 we\u2019ve always known \u2013 that a happy-ever-after is not how a pandemic ends, and that both the mental health and economic toll would be considerable.

      "body": "<p>There is something about singing in public that solicits everyone\u2019s attention instantly and demands a reaction. It makes its own weather system wherever it happens. Even singing that is wildly off-tempo and off-key, like drunken karaoke, can\u2019t be ignored. And when the singing is beautiful, it declares the singer\u2019s emotional state and replicates it in the listener, gluing them together briefly in a moment of shared attention.</p> <p>We have seen and heard this in videos that have emerged from Ukraine in the past few weeks and gone viral. MPs lustily singing the Ukrainian national anthem as they returned to parliament. Parents singing folk songs to their children in underground stations to keep their spirits up. A young girl silencing the other occupants of a Kyiv bunker with a rendition of Let it Go from <em>Frozen</em>. Singing stops us in our tracks in a way that speech rarely can.</p> <p>I have always loved to sing. For most of my adult life, though, I have just sung to myself \u2013 in the shower, in the car, or along the corridors at work. Then, three years ago, I joined a sea-shanty choir. Liverpool, where I live, has a rich shanty tradition and our choir\u2019s leader, Professor Gerry Smyth, is a leading scholar of the form. We were an unlikely crew to be singing these rough-hewn sailors\u2019 work songs, meant to accompany the hauling of ropes on ship. Women outnumbered men in our group, as they do in most choirs, and none of us looks as if we could heave up an anchor. I get seasick on the Mersey ferry. But the sense of incongruity soon wore off, and I found, along with the two million other people in the UK who belong to choirs, that singing in unison and harmony with others is a joyful thing.</p> <p>We started doing gigs in pubs and bars, the first time I had sung for an audience since concerts at school. Writing, my only other creative outlet, connects with its readers one-sidedly and remotely. Mostly it generates polite interest or indifference, or any enthusiasm is long-delayed \u2013 as if you\u2019d dropped a stone down a really deep well and heard, months or years later, the tiny splash of a reader\u2019s response as it hit the water. When we sang, the response was instant. We woke up the room.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have always loved to sing to myself \u2013 in the shower, in the car. Then, three years ago, I joined a sea-shanty choir</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And then Covid silenced us. Some choirs migrated online, with varying success. We had a couple of desultory meetings on Zoom, but soon realised that you can\u2019t sing in unison because of the millisecond time lag. The urge to sing remained. So, to raise my spirits in the boredom and anxiety of lockdown, I started singing to karaoke backing tracks on YouTube. I soon acquired a weirdly eclectic repertoire, mostly governed by the singers (Frank Sinatra, Glen Campbell, David Cassidy) who sing in the same keys as me. On my daily walk, I would turn a corner and find myself singing full-throated to a startled-looking dog walker.</p> <p>It was worth the odd awkward encounter. Singing, I am sure, has got me through the last two difficult years. Its mental and physical health benefits are well established. It has been found to reduce stress, release mood-boosting hormones and increase the body\u2019s tolerance of pain. Graham Welch, professor of music education at the UCL Institute of Education, has collated this evidence for more than 30 years. For him, the physiological and psychological effects of singing both derive from its status as a primal act, \u201cinterwoven with core emotional states that are central to the human condition\u201d. When you sing, you feel your chest and head vibrating and the lungs properly filling and emptying. It reminds you that you are a living, breathing, sentient body, taking up its own space in the world and making its own noise. Amateur singers tend to delude themselves about how good they sound. A voice always sounds better to its owner than to an audience, because it resonates more sonorously through the bones of the skull than through the air. (This explains why we find recorded versions of our voices so thin and disappointing.) Still, I admit it: I like the sound of my own voice.</p> <p>The voice is the oldest musical instrument of all \u2013 and the most complicated. At root it is just an exhaled breath, the noise made when the air rising up from the lungs vibrates against the glottis, the V-shaped aperture between the vocal folds, before being modulated by the jaw, tongue, lips and teeth as the air travels through them. But really singing is done with the whole body, and every aspect of our carriage and posture affects it. Any bit of tension in the shoulders, chest or abdominal muscles, even locked knees or a sprained ankle, affects the sound that comes out of our mouths. That sound is your vocal tone, something as unique to you as your fingerprints. It might delight or mortify you, but you can\u2019t be indifferent to it, any more than you could be indifferent to the face that greets you in the mirror. Like it or not, it is you.</p> <p>Even the most angelic-sounding voice still feels fully human, with its own knotty grain and texture, its own unreproducible flaws and glitches. The philosopher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/29/the-monarchy-of-fear-review-martha-nussbaum\" title=\"\">Martha Nussbaum</a> argues that we measure aesthetic achievements, as we do athletic achievements, against the constraints of the human body. \u201cHuman limits structure the human excellences, and give excellent action its significance,\u201d she writes. When a soprano pulls off those outrageous top Fs in the Queen of the Night aria from <em>The Magic Flute</em>, it astonishes and delights because it\u2019s just, but only just, within the limits of human lung power and vocal range. Like Usain Bolt running 100m in 9.58 seconds, this kind of singing feels virtuosic, but still something that a mere mortal could do.</p> <p>In her book about singing, <em>Naked at the Albert Hall</em>, the musician Tracey Thorn points out what a mundanely technical business it is. \u201cThere\u2019s more thinking in singing than you might think,\u201d she writes. The singer must learn to breathe in all the right places and release the air slowly, take little top-up breaths where they can, work their tongue round the trickier consonants, and train their swallowing muscles, near the larynx, to sit still while the larynx does all the work. That swoon-inducing effect achieved by moving dramatically up and down the scale is a matter of managing what opera singers call the passaggio: the transition between the deeper and thicker \u201cchest voice\u201d and the higher and lighter \u201chead voice\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even the most angelic-sounding voice still feels fully human, with its own knotty grain and texture</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I don\u2019t much care for the bravura style of singing on <em>The Voice</em> and other TV talent shows, with its love of portamento (sliding up to the note) and melisma (using lots of notes on one syllable). It feels like singing as competitive sport, all vocal pyrotechnics at the expense of the words. And learning a song for me is about getting to know the words intimately, savouring them in the mouth before letting them flow into the melody and metre. It means going over the chewier diction, thinking carefully about stress and intonation, and noting where you need an extra breath to sing through a line break without breaking the syntactical sense.</p> <p>Singing every day is heartening because you can hear yourself improving. Almost without trying, I found my tone getting smoother, my range expanding and my breath sustaining for longer notes and phrases. As the pandemic wore on and the days melded into a homogeneous mass, singing gave my life at least some measure of progress and momentum. Still, I longed to sing in a group again. Group singing was one of the last activities to be released from coronavirus restrictions, because the respiratory droplets and aerosols that singers exhale are thought to make it high-risk.</p> <p>Even before Covid, singers would fret constantly about the state and health of their voices; throat-knackering air conditioning, dry sinuses, or that little tickle that might be a cold, or worse. Singers know that the voice is like life itself \u2013 a fragile, mortal, capricious thing that can falter and founder without warning. The lungs lose power as we get older, and the muscle fibres in the vocal folds become stiffer and thinner. The voice is the only musical instrument that is alive, and the only one that ages and dies with its owner.</p> <p>And yet this fragility is precisely what makes the voice so magical. The ugly and unreliable mechanics of singing, all that flapping around of laryngeal cartilage and muscle, are invisible. The voice has no proper home, in the body or anywhere else; it is pure action, existing only when released into space. So when it materialises in the presence of other people it feels like a small miracle, as if we were mainlining the contents of another human heart.</p> <p>To sing, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/08/joan-baez-where-to-start-in-her-back-catalogue\" title=\"\">Joan Baez</a> once wrote, is \u201cto coast into the hearts of the people who listen, to tell them that life is to live, that love is there, that nothing is a promise, but that beauty exists, and must be hunted for and found\u201d. Singing in public is as near as our disenchanted world gets to the \u201cwinged words\u201d that the heroes of Greek epics speak, which fly like feathered arrows to pierce their listeners and leave them changed.

      "bodyText": "There is something about singing in public that solicits everyone\u2019s attention instantly and demands a reaction. It makes its own weather system wherever it happens. Even singing that is wildly off-tempo and off-key, like drunken karaoke, can\u2019t be ignored. And when the singing is beautiful, it declares the singer\u2019s emotional state and replicates it in the listener, gluing them together briefly in a moment of shared attention. We have seen and heard this in videos that have emerged from Ukraine in the past few weeks and gone viral. MPs lustily singing the Ukrainian national anthem as they returned to parliament. Parents singing folk songs to their children in underground stations to keep their spirits up. A young girl silencing the other occupants of a Kyiv bunker with a rendition of Let it Go from Frozen. Singing stops us in our tracks in a way that speech rarely can. I have always loved to sing. For most of my adult life, though, I have just sung to myself \u2013 in the shower, in the car, or along the corridors at work. Then, three years ago, I joined a sea-shanty choir. Liverpool, where I live, has a rich shanty tradition and our choir\u2019s leader, Professor Gerry Smyth, is a leading scholar of the form. We were an unlikely crew to be singing these rough-hewn sailors\u2019 work songs, meant to accompany the hauling of ropes on ship. Women outnumbered men in our group, as they do in most choirs, and none of us looks as if we could heave up an anchor. I get seasick on the Mersey ferry. But the sense of incongruity soon wore off, and I found, along with the two million other people in the UK who belong to choirs, that singing in unison and harmony with others is a joyful thing. We started doing gigs in pubs and bars, the first time I had sung for an audience since concerts at school. Writing, my only other creative outlet, connects with its readers one-sidedly and remotely. Mostly it generates polite interest or indifference, or any enthusiasm is long-delayed \u2013 as if you\u2019d dropped a stone down a really deep well and heard, months or years later, the tiny splash of a reader\u2019s response as it hit the water. When we sang, the response was instant. We woke up the room. And then Covid silenced us. Some choirs migrated online, with varying success. We had a couple of desultory meetings on Zoom, but soon realised that you can\u2019t sing in unison because of the millisecond time lag. The urge to sing remained. So, to raise my spirits in the boredom and anxiety of lockdown, I started singing to karaoke backing tracks on YouTube. I soon acquired a weirdly eclectic repertoire, mostly governed by the singers (Frank Sinatra, Glen Campbell, David Cassidy) who sing in the same keys as me. On my daily walk, I would turn a corner and find myself singing full-throated to a startled-looking dog walker. It was worth the odd awkward encounter. Singing, I am sure, has got me through the last two difficult years. Its mental and physical health benefits are well established. It has been found to reduce stress, release mood-boosting hormones and increase the body\u2019s tolerance of pain. Graham Welch, professor of music education at the UCL Institute of Education, has collated this evidence for more than 30 years. For him, the physiological and psychological effects of singing both derive from its status as a primal act, \u201cinterwoven with core emotional states that are central to the human condition\u201d. When you sing, you feel your chest and head vibrating and the lungs properly filling and emptying. It reminds you that you are a living, breathing, sentient body, taking up its own space in the world and making its own noise. Amateur singers tend to delude themselves about how good they sound. A voice always sounds better to its owner than to an audience, because it resonates more sonorously through the bones of the skull than through the air. (This explains why we find recorded versions of our voices so thin and disappointing.) Still, I admit it: I like the sound of my own voice. The voice is the oldest musical instrument of all \u2013 and the most complicated. At root it is just an exhaled breath, the noise made when the air rising up from the lungs vibrates against the glottis, the V-shaped aperture between the vocal folds, before being modulated by the jaw, tongue, lips and teeth as the air travels through them. But really singing is done with the whole body, and every aspect of our carriage and posture affects it. Any bit of tension in the shoulders, chest or abdominal muscles, even locked knees or a sprained ankle, affects the sound that comes out of our mouths. That sound is your vocal tone, something as unique to you as your fingerprints. It might delight or mortify you, but you can\u2019t be indifferent to it, any more than you could be indifferent to the face that greets you in the mirror. Like it or not, it is you. Even the most angelic-sounding voice still feels fully human, with its own knotty grain and texture, its own unreproducible flaws and glitches. The philosopher Martha Nussbaum argues that we measure aesthetic achievements, as we do athletic achievements, against the constraints of the human body. \u201cHuman limits structure the human excellences, and give excellent action its significance,\u201d she writes. When a soprano pulls off those outrageous top Fs in the Queen of the Night aria from The Magic Flute, it astonishes and delights because it\u2019s just, but only just, within the limits of human lung power and vocal range. Like Usain Bolt running 100m in 9.58 seconds, this kind of singing feels virtuosic, but still something that a mere mortal could do. In her book about singing, Naked at the Albert Hall, the musician Tracey Thorn points out what a mundanely technical business it is. \u201cThere\u2019s more thinking in singing than you might think,\u201d she writes. The singer must learn to breathe in all the right places and release the air slowly, take little top-up breaths where they can, work their tongue round the trickier consonants, and train their swallowing muscles, near the larynx, to sit still while the larynx does all the work. That swoon-inducing effect achieved by moving dramatically up and down the scale is a matter of managing what opera singers call the passaggio: the transition between the deeper and thicker \u201cchest voice\u201d and the higher and lighter \u201chead voice\u201d. I don\u2019t much care for the bravura style of singing on The Voice and other TV talent shows, with its love of portamento (sliding up to the note) and melisma (using lots of notes on one syllable). It feels like singing as competitive sport, all vocal pyrotechnics at the expense of the words. And learning a song for me is about getting to know the words intimately, savouring them in the mouth before letting them flow into the melody and metre. It means going over the chewier diction, thinking carefully about stress and intonation, and noting where you need an extra breath to sing through a line break without breaking the syntactical sense. Singing every day is heartening because you can hear yourself improving. Almost without trying, I found my tone getting smoother, my range expanding and my breath sustaining for longer notes and phrases. As the pandemic wore on and the days melded into a homogeneous mass, singing gave my life at least some measure of progress and momentum. Still, I longed to sing in a group again. Group singing was one of the last activities to be released from coronavirus restrictions, because the respiratory droplets and aerosols that singers exhale are thought to make it high-risk.

I get it now. Then there are the birds, my God, the birds. I didn\u2019t realise spring had a playlist until I moved here: every day it\u2019s earlier and richer, a raucous polyphony of seduction, aggression and the simple fact of being alive. Watching them is even better: like a superior Pok\u00e9mon Go, the thrill of spotting something a bit different: lollipop-shaped, long-tailed tits, surely designed in some Pixar cuteness lab.</p> <p>But even the regulars are spectacular. The resident sparrows brawl, shag and shout like nightmare neighbours from a Channel 5 show. Starlings drop by in gangs, cocky and peacock-iridescent, with an eery, almost-electrical, click and whistle. A magpie keeps trying to carry a far-too-big branch up a tree, like an over-ambitious Labrador: how am I supposed to work when I can watch that?</p> <p>The blackbirds are best. I put seeds on my windowsill and multiple times a day I look up, watch a blackbird\u2019s undulating flight towards me, feel the satisfying feathery whump as it lands and the thrill of getting checked out by a yellow-ringed eye. Walking the neighbourhood later on, when the sky gets that deeper blue or pink tinge, they sing on every fence and gatepost now, and in some primal part of me, I know it means spring \u2013 the real one \u2013 is coming. My heart lifts like it\u2019s filled with helium.</p> <p>I\u2019m happy, I suppose. I didn\u2019t imagine happiness could be so easy and so close: a furred magnolia bud and a song at dusk between the MOT garage and the Spar. I hope it\u2019s OK to say that. It\u2019s hard to know what to do with happiness at the moment, when spring is unfurling east of here, too \u2013 flowers blooming, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/monicaellena/status/1501097463658262528\" title=\"\">lambs being born</a> \u2013 and two million people are missing their bulbs coming up, or the tree they like down the street blossoming.

It was spring, it goes, \u201cthe whole pageantry of the year was awake tingling with itself\u201d.</p> <p>But I don\u2019t believe happiness makes you indifferent. It makes you aware of what it might be to lose a home, birdsong, the simple animal joy of being alive.

I\u2019m no gardener \u2013 the neighbours wince when they look over the wall \u2013 so I\u2019m late to the fizzing, extraordinary anticipation that comes from every bud, every pale spike poking through hard earth and every pollen-dusted catkin. I get it now. Then there are the birds, my God, the birds. I didn\u2019t realise spring had a playlist until I moved here: every day it\u2019s earlier and richer, a raucous polyphony of seduction, aggression and the simple fact of being alive. Watching them is even better: like a superior Pok\u00e9mon Go, the thrill of spotting something a bit different: lollipop-shaped, long-tailed tits, surely designed in some Pixar cuteness lab. But even the regulars are spectacular. The resident sparrows brawl, shag and shout like nightmare neighbours from a Channel 5 show. Starlings drop by in gangs, cocky and peacock-iridescent, with an eery, almost-electrical, click and whistle. A magpie keeps trying to carry a far-too-big branch up a tree, like an over-ambitious Labrador: how am I supposed to work when I can watch that? The blackbirds are best. I put seeds on my windowsill and multiple times a day I look up, watch a blackbird\u2019s undulating flight towards me, feel the satisfying feathery whump as it lands and the thrill of getting checked out by a yellow-ringed eye. Walking the neighbourhood later on, when the sky gets that deeper blue or pink tinge, they sing on every fence and gatepost now, and in some primal part of me, I know it means spring \u2013 the real one \u2013 is coming. My heart lifts like it\u2019s filled with helium. I\u2019m happy, I suppose. I didn\u2019t imagine happiness could be so easy and so close: a furred magnolia bud and a song at dusk between the MOT garage and the Spar. I hope it\u2019s OK to say that. It\u2019s hard to know what to do with happiness at the moment, when spring is unfurling east of here, too \u2013 flowers blooming, lambs being born \u2013 and two million people are missing their bulbs coming up, or the tree they like down the street blossoming. When it\u2019s the backdrop to outrageous suffering. Poetry sometimes helps: William Carlos Williams\u2019s Landscape with the Fall of Icarus is good on that dissonance of pain while the world goes about its perennial business. It was spring, it goes, \u201cthe whole pageantry of the year was awake tingling with itself\u201d. But I don\u2019t believe happiness makes you indifferent. It makes you aware of what it might be to lose a home, birdsong, the simple animal joy of being alive. Spring. Follow Emma on Twitter @BelgianWaffling",

      "body": "<p>My dad died earlier this year. On the upside, we got a new cat. This may sound like a flip gag, and indeed it is, but it also isn\u2019t. Let me explain. In the 1970s, fathers were not expected to show love to their children. Or much to their wives. I grew up with my dad and three brothers in a house where familial affection, as we understand it now, was low in the everyday mix. However: we had a cat. She was called Phomphar. This name was my father\u2019s idea, an onomatopoeic rendition of the noise she made when she was happy, which most people would call purring, but he called phompharing. This indicates something, which is that if my father did have a softer side, it was shown mainly to the cats. By softer side, what I mean is he would pick them up and aggressively sniff their heads and say \u201cYou\u2019re a great beast \u2013 what are you? A great beast, yes you are!\u201d But trust me, for Colin Baddiel, that was effectively a love sonnet.</p> <p>Cats, therefore, for me are a deep point of connection, with my childhood and with my now gone parents. There was very little beauty in my childhood \u2013 this is not a misery memoir-style statement, it\u2019s just a true one about Dollis Hill, northwest London, in the 1970s \u2013 but Phomphar was beautiful. Of course she was. She was a cat. Now, luckily, I have a lot more beauty in my life, and a lot more softness and a lot less gruff, blunt maleness, but I am still utterly in thrall to the beauty of cats. I am a fundamental atheist, but when I look at one of my cats \u2013 I presently have four \u2013 curving like a Matisse in a shaft of sunlight, I believe in God. Some people on social media see me as the antichrist, but really, I am the anti-Zouma.</p> <p>I have never, since I was a child, not had at least one cat. Even when I was at university and living in halls of residence, I smuggled in a stray and fed it regularly. I also had one when I shared a flat with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/frank-skinner\" title=\"\">Frank Skinner</a>. Frank is not a cat man, but he is very committed to comedy, and the name of the tabby who lived with us, arrived at after a short brainstorming session (mainly driven by his extraordinary punning ability) was Chairman Meow. There are not many hills I am prepared to die on, but that this is the best name ever for a cat is one. One proof is that it \u2013 the name, not the cat \u2013 was stolen soon after by <em>Will &amp; Grace</em>. Another is that the first time I took her \u2013 Chairman was a her, unlike Zedong, although even if alive today and on Twitter, I doubt he\u2019d have been that big on announcing pronouns \u2013 to the vet, and the receptionist asked for the cat\u2019s name, it got in the crowded waiting room a massive laugh. Obviously, I was very pleased about this, except I noticed the receptionist just wrote down, on her computer, \u201cMeow\u201d \u2013 just, as if it were her surname. Which meant that when I went through to the actual vet and saw him glance at the information on his computer about this new cat, I could tell, from a raised eyebrow, that he was thinking \u201cMeow\u201d \u2013 what a shit name for a cat. Supposed to be a writer and comedian and he goes that unoriginal on a cat name? But it felt too late to explain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5fcb3d9d1351e7f9502be67258e6da677870e72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5fcb3d9d1351e7f9502be67258e6da677870e72/0_4112_10652_8824/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In the frame: David with a picture of the much-missed \u2013 and brilliantly named \u2013 Chairman Meow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"828\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the frame: David with a picture of the much-missed \u2013 and brilliantly named \u2013 Chairman Meow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Burn-Forti/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It isn\u2019t, however, just about beauty, because cats are not just beautiful (although they really are: what other small animal is a perfect micro-copy of their big version? When I see Ron, my all ginger polydactyl \u2013 he has seven toes \u2013 boy, I just think: this is a lion cub. I basically live with a lion cub). Some of you may be aware that although my day job is still, nominally, comedian, late in my career I\u2019ve been pulled into a type of activism, where I spend much of my time trying to redress various negative stereotypes and myths and bad imaginings that surround a long-maligned group. It may be time however for me to move on from Jews, to cats.</p> <p><em><strong>I have got to the age</strong></em> now where the only jobs I want to do are ones I know I\u2019m going to actively enjoy, so I recently suggested to a TV production company, who were keen to hear my ideas, a show called <em>David Baddiel: Cat Man</em>. The idea being that I \u2013 the person in the title \u2013 would go round the country visiting people with extraordinary and characterful cats, and they would show me the cats being extraordinary and characterful. That\u2019s it. I can\u2019t think of a show I\u2019d love to do more. But what the TV company got back when they pitched this idea to broadcasters was: cats? Extraordinary and characterful? They just sit around preening themselves. They\u2019re all the same. Now, dogs\u2026</p> <p>There\u2019s a number of things wrong with this attitude. First, it\u2019s wrong. I mean, it\u2019s just a priori wrong. Cats have won. In the eternal battle between them and the barking, snappy ones as to who humans prefer being around, there is no doubt that first place has gone to the felines. People who don\u2019t accept this will point to the fact that in the UK, there are still slightly more dog-owners than cat ones, but these are analogue people who presumably have never heard of the internet. In 2015 \u2013 these are the figures I can find, now it will be 10 times that \u2013 there were more than 2m cat videos on YouTube, with an average of 12,000 views each, a higher average than any other category. So from the point of view of what animals people like to watch and look at on their screens, these TV commissioners genuflecting reflexively towards dogs are just incorrect.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I saw the vet glance at the cat\u2019s name on the file and raise an eyebrow</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Secondly, it\u2019s wrong. Because cats don\u2019t pander to humans, that doesn\u2019t mean that they are inexpressive. I\u2019ve really had a lot of them, and each one has been very different and absurdly idiosyncratic. Pip, Ron\u2019s mother, is often lazy and irritable, but will come over all kittenish and adorable if my wife sings her, at a particular pitch, Only You by Yazoo. Chairman Meow would stick her tongue out at you if you ran your fingers over a comb. Tiger, Ron\u2019s brother, will grab your attention by tapping you gently on the arm with his paw, which is not unusual in and of itself, but he often becomes uncertain about the tap on the way to the tapping moment and so just stays with his paw poised in the air staring at you in hope and confusion, which is so cute it makes me want to die. These are just the tips of the various icebergs of personality that a few of the cats I\u2019ve owned display.</p> <p>Yes, there are some issues with cat ownership. Recently, I went to watch Chelsea play a midweek game and, because I\u2019d be getting back quite late, decided to cook dinner (monkfish in teriyaki sauce) before leaving, thinking, \u201cI\u2019ll just pop that in the microwave when I return.\u201d I left it in the pan, covered with a bowl and a cake mesh. When I got home, they\u2019d eaten it. Pip, Ron and Tiger had combined so well \u2013 presumably they thought, \u201cThat\u2019s nice, not only has he left us a meal, he\u2019s set it up as the prize at the end of an entertaining obstacle course\u201d \u2013 leaving the bowl and the cake mesh so neatly next to the pan, that I assumed the heist must have been perpetrated by a human.

      "bodyText": "My dad died earlier this year. On the upside, we got a new cat. This may sound like a flip gag, and indeed it is, but it also isn\u2019t. Let me explain. In the 1970s, fathers were not expected to show love to their children. Or much to their wives. I grew up with my dad and three brothers in a house where familial affection, as we understand it now, was low in the everyday mix. However: we had a cat. She was called Phomphar. This name was my father\u2019s idea, an onomatopoeic rendition of the noise she made when she was happy, which most people would call purring, but he called phompharing. This indicates something, which is that if my father did have a softer side, it was shown mainly to the cats. By softer side, what I mean is he would pick them up and aggressively sniff their heads and say \u201cYou\u2019re a great beast \u2013 what are you? A great beast, yes you are!\u201d But trust me, for Colin Baddiel, that was effectively a love sonnet. Cats, therefore, for me are a deep point of connection, with my childhood and with my now gone parents. There was very little beauty in my childhood \u2013 this is not a misery memoir-style statement, it\u2019s just a true one about Dollis Hill, northwest London, in the 1970s \u2013 but Phomphar was beautiful. Of course she was. She was a cat. Now, luckily, I have a lot more beauty in my life, and a lot more softness and a lot less gruff, blunt maleness, but I am still utterly in thrall to the beauty of cats. I am a fundamental atheist, but when I look at one of my cats \u2013 I presently have four \u2013 curving like a Matisse in a shaft of sunlight, I believe in God. Some people on social media see me as the antichrist, but really, I am the anti-Zouma. I have never, since I was a child, not had at least one cat. Even when I was at university and living in halls of residence, I smuggled in a stray and fed it regularly. I also had one when I shared a flat with Frank Skinner. Frank is not a cat man, but he is very committed to comedy, and the name of the tabby who lived with us, arrived at after a short brainstorming session (mainly driven by his extraordinary punning ability) was Chairman Meow. There are not many hills I am prepared to die on, but that this is the best name ever for a cat is one. One proof is that it \u2013 the name, not the cat \u2013 was stolen soon after by Will &amp; Grace. Another is that the first time I took her \u2013 Chairman was a her, unlike Zedong, although even if alive today and on Twitter, I doubt he\u2019d have been that big on announcing pronouns \u2013 to the vet, and the receptionist asked for the cat\u2019s name, it got in the crowded waiting room a massive laugh. Obviously, I was very pleased about this, except I noticed the receptionist just wrote down, on her computer, \u201cMeow\u201d \u2013 just, as if it were her surname. Which meant that when I went through to the actual vet and saw him glance at the information on his computer about this new cat, I could tell, from a raised eyebrow, that he was thinking \u201cMeow\u201d \u2013 what a shit name for a cat. Supposed to be a writer and comedian and he goes that unoriginal on a cat name? But it felt too late to explain. It isn\u2019t, however, just about beauty, because cats are not just beautiful (although they really are: what other small animal is a perfect micro-copy of their big version? When I see Ron, my all ginger polydactyl \u2013 he has seven toes \u2013 boy, I just think: this is a lion cub. I basically live with a lion cub). Some of you may be aware that although my day job is still, nominally, comedian, late in my career I\u2019ve been pulled into a type of activism, where I spend much of my time trying to redress various negative stereotypes and myths and bad imaginings that surround a long-maligned group.

The exhibition will open online on 23 March, the two-year anniversary of the first lockdown, and the physical exhibits are expected to move to the new museum site in 2023. \u201cWe saw a strong desire from children to control their own spaces, with a huge amount of den-building. Perhaps this is unexpected when children were already being kept inside in limited spaces, but a den under a blanket or a dining table can give a greater feeling of security and power over their own environment.\u201d Other submissions include a seven-year-old\u2019s \u201cpretend virus-free hairdressers\u201d and Barbie dolls participating in Joe Wicks\u2019s online exercise class. Rituals of hand-sanitising and hand-washing also became formalised into songs and games. There was clear evidence that the first lockdown, which took place in spring, had been easier for most children. \u201cGoing outdoors allowed children to explore their neighbourhood in new ways. The second lockdown was worse, but children showed a great level of ingenuity,\u201d Potter said. Play specialists from Great Ormond Street hospital advised on the project. \u201cNot every child had such a good play experience, of course,\u201d said Potter. \u201cWe should not forget that some were overwhelmed by anxiety and felt very restricted.\u201d Submitted photographs feature chalked \u201cKeep out\u201d signs on the pavement and images of a virtual Minecraft funeral a child created when he was unable to attend in person. There are also pictures of toddlers Covid-testing their teddy bears and creating face coverings for hospital role play. Displayed next to the drawing Germs and Hand Sanitiser, by four-year-old Cadi from Pontarddulais, Swansea, is the Young V&amp;A\u2019s Study of a Gas Mask, made between 1939 and 1942 by Byron Dun, aged between 11 and 14 at the time. \u201cThis project has enabled us to move the discussion on from \u2018learning loss\u2019 as the only effect of the pandemic on childhood, and given us a chance to reflect on how children may respond now and in the future to crises and emergencies,\u201d Potter said.",

This summer\u2019s three-Test tour of New Zealand will help to develop a vibrant style that accounted for the All Blacks last November. \u201cIt\u2019s massive,\u201d said the head coach, Andy Farrell, of the summer tour. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect opportunity that the group need \u2026 Going to New Zealand, there\u2019s no pressure like it, so it\u2019s a perfect opportunity to find out more about ourselves.\u201d Farrell\u2019s side are increasingly finely tuned: backs and forwards alike comfortable offloading, an enviable collective ability to generate quick ruck ball, with intelligent running lines across the field. They are also lethal when driving off attacking lineouts, evidenced by Cian Healy\u2019s first-half try. Ireland finished strongly but it was a somewhat disjointed tournament. After dismantling Wales in Dublin, the unsurpassed brilliance of Antoine Dupont and Romain Ntamack, along with French pack\u2019s crushing power, proved too much in Paris. Ireland recovered impressively having trailed 22-7, eventually losing by six. The round-three victory against 13-man Italy was useful learning in one sense: collectively Ireland failed to deal with a radical departure from the expected script. Farrell may suspect there is work to be done on the team\u2019s ability to adapt, especially considering they went on to labour against another depleted opponent at Twickenham. Despite Charlie Ewels\u2019 early red card, the Irish scrum suffered at the hands of a fired-up England. The first-choice front-rows Andrew Porter and R\u00f3nan Kelleher are missing, however, so perhaps that can be seen as an off day rather than a chronic problem. The full-back Hugo Keenan and centre Garry Ringrose are two members of Ireland\u2019s back division who are beginning to excel at international level. Ringrose\u2019s reading of the game, in particular, is significant and Keenan\u2019s heroic try-saving tackle on Stuart Hogg was an accurate reflection of his ability. Sexton, meanwhile, will be 38 by next September. His celebration of the late bonus point-clinching try illustrated his enduring hunger. The Leinster fly-half says he wants to avoid going out \u201cwith a whimper\u201d and a potential World Cup quarter-final against France or New Zealand will give him every opportunity. Asked if this is the strongest Ireland squad he has been involved with, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got great potential, haven\u2019t we? That\u2019s what we have at the moment. We\u2019ve got to make it reality, we\u2019ve got to keep building over the next 18 months. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken a slightly different approach, we\u2019ve started talking about it already, that this is the journey. It\u2019s a different approach to the previous management that I\u2019ve worked under, and I think it\u2019s the right way to do it.\u201d For Scotland, after the euphoria of the opening win over England at Murrayfield, their considerable promise again remains unfulfilled. They have all the ingredients, and Rory Darge is the latest eye-catching product of their back-row talent factory. Hogg\u2019s decision to ignore his teammates before being shoved into touch by Keenan is not the sort of mistake that he, or his team, can afford when they meet Ireland in Paris next October.",

He joined the security forces then entered public service. That is the wrong term: he began to participate in the looting that is the incessant occupation of those who hold public office in his country. This became his life\u2019s work, to remain an insider, not to tumble from the enclave of wealth and safety into the turbulent world outside.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3f9b709713a3214fe2861abaec1bd83775a67bfc\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f9b709713a3214fe2861abaec1bd83775a67bfc/2379_251_2652_3316/800.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Burgis\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Burgis</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlie Bibby</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He grew rich. He rose. He grew richer. So did those on whom he bestowed his favour, those he licensed to loot. They fawned over him, told of his greatness. As for the rest, those in whose name he ruled, there was no need to seek their consent. Instead, to maintain control, he fed them fear while promising the antidote. They are coming, the others, those who wish us harm, wish to take what we have, but I will keep you safe. It was a double life: he was at once the thief and the guard.</p> \n<p>The man I have in mind was the governor of a Nigerian state. As he guzzled petro-dollars, villages burned in his name. But this sketch applies, with only minor variations, to many of the world\u2019s rulers. From the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to Kazakhstan, most countries\u2019 principal way of making money in the global economy is by selling its basic ingredients: fuel, metals precious and industrial, certain stones. The proceeds are at the disposal of whoever holds power. They take what they want, then hire bankers and lawyers to remove their fingerprints from the loot and stash it in rich countries. They have no need to raise taxes from their own people, so their own people have no way to call them to account. Corruption is the opposite of consent.</p> \n<p>Vladimir Putin\u2019s eligibility for this club of kleptocrats comes across in <em><a href=\"https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/vladimir-putin/first-person/9780786723270/\" title=\"\">First Person</a></em>, a book written by three Russian journalists shortly after Putin became president in 2000, based on interviews with him, his wife and some of his friends. Growing up with rats and abysmal toilets, Putin dreamed of a place in the Soviet empire\u2019s boss class as an officer in the organisation that protected its power, the KGB. One Easter, Putin, then a young recruit, was policing a religious procession outside a church. \u201cHe asked me,\u201d a cellist friend recalls, \u201cwhether I wanted to go up to the altar and take a look. Of course I agreed. There was such boyishness in his gesture \u2013 \u2018nobody can go there, but we can.\u2019\u201d Later, a drunk student asked to bum a cigarette. Putin, a judo champion, said no, then flung the student to the ground. Power is for getting things others cannot have; if others ask for something you do not wish to give, respond with violence.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"10571619f0cee31ed0ae34c68428a03cf3c83397\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10571619f0cee31ed0ae34c68428a03cf3c83397/0_221_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vladimir Putin descends the stairs of the Grand Kremlin Palace at his 2018 inauguration.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vladimir Putin descends the stairs of the Grand Kremlin Palace at his 2018 inauguration.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sasha Mordovets/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Posted to Dresden, Putin lived with his young family in a serviced apartment. There was a driver, good beer, hotdogs in the countryside at weekends. Then the Berlin Wall fell. Angry crowds massed outside the KGB station. He contacted his commanders and was told: \u201cMoscow is silent.\u201d The old order had fallen; he needed to join the new one. He went home to St Petersburg and secured a position in the local government with powers to decide who was allowed to make money by dealing with western capitalists. Naturally, he decided that this should be him and his cronies. He rose. Within a decade, he was president. He took his gang of kleptocrats with him to the Kremlin. (Some of them, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/04/igor-sechin-the-epitome-of-power-in-putin-russia-rosneft-economy\" title=\"\">Igor Sechin</a>, are now on sanctions lists.)</p> \n<p>The rulers of the west applied the same logic to Putin as they applied to the rulers of DRC or Kazakhstan. They wanted to buy these countries\u2019 commodities so they pretended the kleptocrats were legitimate leaders with whom they could do business. They kept this up when he murdered exiled dissidents abroad, when he stole South Ossetia in 2008 and Crimea in 2014, all the while developing a tribal imperialist spiel to stir fealty at home. After 22 years of this, Putin evidently believes his own propaganda that he is a statesman, rather than a character from <em>The Godfather</em>. As his forces devastate Ukraine, I asked a Russian former intelligence officer what Putin wants. \u201cRespect,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about respect.\u201d<br><br>As well as accepting that we have so emboldened him that we may well have to meet him on the battlefield, to confront Putin\u2019s kleptocracy, we must first cease our complicity in it. What do we think happens to the money we pay for Russian gas? How do we imagine western multinationals secure oil-drilling rights dispensed by a regime we know to be corrupt? Who do we think is behind the companies of anonymous ownership, registered in places like Guernsey, Cyprus and the British Virgin Islands, that we continue to allow to participate in our economies? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\" title=\"\">The Panama Papers</a> revealed that one of the human beings behind the corporate camouflage was the cellist Putin took to see a forbidden altar. Somehow he amassed a secret fortune that ran to millions.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"969b6cf06a4718b33d165b039969bdc936ca546a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/969b6cf06a4718b33d165b039969bdc936ca546a/54_0_1043_1304/800.jpg\" alt=\"A young Vladimir Putin in his KGB uniform, circa 1980.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A young Vladimir Putin in his KGB uniform, circa 1980.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Russian Archives/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>We have known the answers to these questions for a long time but it was just too lucrative to tell ourselves we didn\u2019t. Twin pipelines of money sustain Putin and his fellow kleptocrats. One carries western money into kleptocracies to pay for natural resources; the other carries money back out again, after it\u2019s been stolen, for safekeeping in the west\u2019s property markets and universities and political parties. If we wish to weaken him and his system of corrupt power, we must disrupt both pipelines. That means increasing and sustaining the reduction in our consumption of Russian oil and gas. If we do not wish merely to switch our support for one kleptocracy to others, we must replace this energy supply with something other than the fossil fuels that are the lifeblood of kleptocrats everywhere. As for the second pipeline, our noisy declarations that we are turning it off \u2013 that, as Boris Johnson put it, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/28/russian-oligarchs-in-uk-face-new-laws-tackling-dirty-money\" title=\"\">there is no place for dirty money in the UK</a>\u201d \u2013 are laughable. A few names on sanctions lists and some loophole-ridden reforms to economic crime laws not backed by budgets to enforce them are close to meaningless while we still permit financial secrecy.</p> \n<p>Nonetheless, the danger is that by throwing more and more people out of the global economy, we hasten the creation of a shadow one. Sanctions-busting deals between Iran, Venezuela and Russia \u2013 respectively kleptocracies with Islamist, socialist and imperialist masks \u2013 reveal that this alternative is already taking shape. The leaders of the Chinese kleptocracy will use this opportunity to bolster their position at the head of this new order.</p> \n<p>We are watching the rise of what I\u2019ve called Kleptopia. An undeclared, unconventional war between kleptocracy and democracy has been under way since long before Putin\u2019s troops marched into Ukraine. The two sides are not arranged merely by geography. The kleptocrats have plenty of allies in the west, from the lawyers shielding their plunder to the politicians advancing their influence within democratic governments.

For days, I\u2019d been sure the invasion would happen. The question was, on what scale. I\u2019d read speculation in the Russian press about intent to occupy the whole country.

For those of us who know and love Ukraine, but also love Russia, it\u2019s a personal as well as a human tragedy. Large numbers of Russians don\u2019t support the war.

It spoke to those who felt that globalisation had left them behind, when even goods made in Russia often came from factories owned by international corporations: Danone, Ford, Ikea, Heineken.</p> \n<p>When Putin first started talking about the historic unity of Russia and Ukraine, in the spring of 2014, this too seemed expedient, an attempt to justify post factum the impromptu <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/28/russia-crimea-white-house\" title=\"\">annexation of Crimea</a>. The first anniversary of the annexation once past, the rhetoric died down.

A precipitating factor seems to have been the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/09/belarus-election-lukashenko-landslide-victory-fixing-claims\" title=\"\">2020 election protests</a> in Belarus. If that could happen in a country whose loyalty to Russia seemed absolute, where would \u201cexternal powers\u201d (Putin doesn\u2019t believe in dissent without them) get to work next?</p> \n<p>The first difficulty in solving \u201cthe Putin problem\u201d is thus that Putin is determined to defeat and purge independent Ukraine. Peace talks have been an iteration of certainties by Russian delegates set on a no-compromise position. Typical is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-no-positive-developments-yet-ukraine-talks-2022-03-07/\" title=\"\">Vladimir Medinsky</a>, the former culture minister, an ideologue of Russian supremacism supported by bad history.</p> \n<p>It is tempting to think that if Putin and his allies were to disappear, a rational solution would emerge. Yet substantial sections of the population <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/13/my-mother-says-i-am-betraying-russia-putins-invasion-divides-the-generations\" title=\"\">still support Putin</a>: those who share his prejudices about Ukraine; those convinced the west is out to destroy Russia; those for whom things have got better since 1991; those terrified things may get worse.</p> \n<p>Putin, unlike Maria in <em>The Sound of Music</em>, isn\u2019t a problem with an easy solution. But let\u2019s concentrate on what may be achievable. Here\u2019s a brief and imperfect list:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d5fb589af613851b39bbba4e42ce12df4239ca35\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5fb589af613851b39bbba4e42ce12df4239ca35/0_20_3434_2061/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police officers detain a woman during an anti-war protest in St Petersburg on 13 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police officers detain a woman during an anti-war protest in St Petersburg on 13 March.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Push for proper peace talks, accompanied by a full ceasefire, and with participation in the talks of observers trusted by both sides. As the war drags on and casualties mount, and the economic costs begin to bite, there could be a change of heart on the Russian side. There are some signs of disunity at the top even now.</p> \n<p>Listen to voices from the region. A good place to start is Ukrainian activist and historian Taras Bilous\u2019s essay, <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/a-letter-to-the-western-left-from-kyiv/\" title=\"\">A Letter to the Western Left from Kyiv</a> (published recently on openDemocracy), which corrects many of the British media cliches about insuperable linguistic, cultural, historical and geographical divides and the influence of the far right.</p> \n<p>Recognise the efforts, at great personal cost, of the Russians who oppose the war: the demonstrators exposed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/4300-people-arrested-anti-war-protests-across-russia-decounce-vladimir-putin-war-ukraine\" title=\"\">police beatings</a>; the artists and administrators who resign from their jobs; the priests who speak up in their sermons when the hierarchy is silent; a few members of the business elite. Don\u2019t organise blanket boycotts by citizenship.</p> \n<p>Don\u2019t organise boycotts by place of origin either. Rather than ostracising works of art, try to understand the complex history of Russian imperialism. Pushkin\u2019s T<em>o the Slanderers of Russia</em> (1831) told western critics that Russia\u2019s repression of Poland was a family affair. But Evdokiya Rostopchina\u2019s <em>The Forced Marriage</em> (1845) presented Russia and Poland as an abusive husband and defiant wife \u2013 provoking outrage in Nicholas I.</p> \n<p>Keep up the remarkable outpouring of support for Ukraine. Make sure the media caravans and flashmobs don\u2019t just gallop on to the next sensation. After the campaign for peace with honour, there must be generous aid from the west to help Ukrainians rebuild their devastated cities and the democracy that they are fighting so hard to preserve.</p> \n<p>In an address to the nation, the <a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/russian-rectors-union-echoes-kremlin-propaganda-ukraine\" title=\"\">Russian Union of Rectors</a> described Putin\u2019s decision to embark on the \u201cmilitary operation\u201d as \u201cborn of suffering\u201d. When I think of suffering, I don\u2019t see a small man sitting alone at the end of a long table. I see people sheltered in basements and metro stations, separated from their loved ones and their friends, or fleeing from their homes under gunfire.</p> \n<p>A Ukrainian friend, a gifted literary critic, snatched a book as she and her husband left Kyiv. She later found it was <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>. It couldn\u2019t better have suited the mood among those opposed to the war, who are eloquent in their outrage. Maybe Tolstoy was right after all: it is the apparently powerful who lack full humanity, and not those whom they try to harm.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"66aeaa0daff90e7da0654c8f529dd2537955669f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66aeaa0daff90e7da0654c8f529dd2537955669f/1828_118_1729_2161/800.jpg\" alt=\"Oliver Bullough\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Oliver Bullough: \u2018We can deprive him and his cronies of access to their wealth\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Oliver Bullough is the author of</strong><em><strong> Moneyland: Why Thieves and Crooks Now Rule the World and How to Take It Back. </strong></em><strong>His new book</strong><strong> is</strong><em><strong> Butler to the World</strong></em><strong> (Profile)</strong></p> \n<p>All the horror that Putin is unleashing \u2013 the death, the lies, the violence, the refugees trudging through landscapes bleached of their colour by snow and artillery \u2013 echoes the 1940s. Putin himself calls the Ukrainians Nazis, as if this unprovoked aggression is somehow a rerun of the Soviet people\u2019s self-defence in the second world war. That accusation is disgusting, but it\u2019s harder to dismiss the parallels between Putin\u2019s own behaviour and those of the dictators of the mid-20th century.</p> \n<p>He is driven by a perverse misreading of history to deny his neighbours\u2019 humanity. Russian officials and politicians are aggressive in their patriotism. The orange-and-black striped medal ribbon became the nationalist symbol when Putin invaded Ukraine in 2014, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/why-has-the-letter-z-become-the-symbol-of-war-for-russia\" title=\"\">air-recognition-mark \u201cZ\u201d </a>has rapidly morphed into an equivalent for this new war. Putin is a bully who invades his neighbours and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/05/ten-years-putin-press-kremlin-grip-russia-media-tightens\" title=\"\">kills his critics</a>, and whose government lies compulsively, even about facts that are so self-evidently true that denying them seems self-defeating. He is even driving his tanks through Ukraine, the second world war\u2019s main battleground.</p> \n<p>In the circumstances, how could our understanding of Putin not be filtered through 20th-century history? And of course there are lessons for us from that time \u2013 about the futility of appeasement, and the heroism of ordinary humans caught up in inhumanity. But Putin is not Hitler or Benito Mussolini, he is not even Joseph Stalin, he is a modern problem, and solving a problem like him requires new skills, new sacrifices, and new laws.</p> \n<p>In the first place, the Russian elite\u2019s patriotism and anti-western posturing is performative. The anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny has made a cottage industry of revealing how top-ranking officials or regime propagandists have property in countries that are the supposed enemy. After a hard week campaigning against the evil west, which is undermining Christian civilisation by allowing gay people to get married, they would fly to their villas in Italy or<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/06/how-london-became-the-place-to-be-for-putins-oligarchs\" title=\"\"> their townhouses in London</a>.

These kleptocrats exploited connections in government to gain lucrative contracts or state property, but they don\u2019t trust the legal system, which waved through this monstrous spate of theft, any more than any other Russian does. That is why they have moved at least half of their wealth out of Russia, and spent it on houses, yachts, football clubs, fine art and more. Their investment managers have been in London, Luxembourg and New York, and complement the harder skills that the oligarchs learned in Russia\u2019s business climate.</p> \n<p>What would Russia be without these offshore services? It would be a fading power with a declining population run by an ageing political class loyal to a dead empire. Its sole world-class assets are its resources of oil, gas and minerals, many of which will become irrelevant in the decarbonised world we are moving towards. The USSR\u2019s soft power was once enormous, with its communist ideology, sublime ballet companies, film directors and musicians. But what does the Kremlin have now? A misinformation machine and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/04/china-has-little-to-gain-but-much-to-lose-as-russias-ally\" title=\"\">an unequal alliance with a Chinese elite</a> that must be looking at Russia\u2019s riches and licking their lips.</p> \n<p>Putin claims to be defending the rights of Russian-speakers everywhere, yet during the pandemic, Russia <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/coronavirus-excess-deaths-tracker\" title=\"\">had the worst rate of excess deaths</a> of any country, a rate twice as bad as that of the United States and three times as bad as Britain\u2019s. If he truly cared about the nation he serves, he would be focusing on Russia\u2019s healthcare catastrophe instead of sending its sons to die in Ukraine.</p> \n<p>We cannot solve the problem of Putin; only the Russians can do that. But we can stop helping him be a bigger problem than he has to be. The first step is to deprive him and his cronies of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/07/oligarchs-selling-uk-property-to-avoid-new-register-may-have-to-declare-details\" title=\"\">their access to our financial system</a>. Being able to bury their wealth deep in our economies has allowed Russia\u2019s rulers to avoid the consequences of their own greed: their children have studied in English schools; their wealth has been invested in western funds; their German-built yachts fly under the flags of British tax havens.</p> \n<p>The way to do this is to strip them of the shield they can gain from opaque shell companies. Britain\u2019s tax havens have sold secrecy to anyone able to afford it, while the UK\u2019s Companies House has provided the cover for hundreds of billions of pounds of stolen wealth to flow out of Russia. When the shield over assets is lifted, we must give our law enforcement agencies <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EndCorruptionUK/status/1485532798349938695\" title=\"\">the resources they need</a> to investigate the assets\u2019 provenance, and confiscate anything of criminal origin.</p> \n<p>Stripped of their access to the international financial system and of their stolen riches, Putin\u2019s oligarchs will be not plutocrats but thugs. Deprived of their boltholes, they will be forced either to improve Russia for everyone that lives in it, or they will be swept from power.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d56a14460b6a57dc975ec1f96c61cd36a5ce87a7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d56a14460b6a57dc975ec1f96c61cd36a5ce87a7/407_435_2512_3141/800.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Ruth Deyermond\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Ruth Deyermond: \u2018Closing contact will confirm Putin\u2019s narrative that the west wants to destroy Russia\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Ruth Deyermond is senior lecturer in post-Soviet security in the Department of War Studies, King\u2019s College London</strong></p> \n<p>Although Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine is less than a month old, the debate about what will come after it is already starting to emerge.</p> \n<p>So far, the war appears to be going very badly for Russia. Its assumptions about the country it chose to invade have been exposed as fatally flawed; years of expensive military reform have failed to produce an army capable of effectively fighting a war of choice; and it has had to deny asking the Chinese government to feed and arm its troops.</p> \n<p>Despite this litany of humiliations, the relative strength of the Russian armed forces mean that a military victory can\u2019t be ruled out. There would probably be continued resistance, forcing Russia to choose between draining its catastrophically damaged economy and military capabilities in an open-ended occupation, and a withdrawal. Unless sanctions are lifted, its most important trading and diplomatic relationships \u2013 above all, with China \u2013 will be firmly tilted in favour of its partners, who will be able to deal with Russia on much more favourable terms than in the past.</p> \n<p>Whatever happens in Ukraine, it seems likely that Putin will remain in power for the foreseeable future. Nothing about his behaviour in the past decade has indicated that he would be willing to give up power voluntarily, and it seems unlikely that those in the best position to remove him will do so, not least because they are themselves closely tied to Putin and his crimes.</p> \n<p>This raises the question of how western states respond to a Putin-led Russia and how they organise their relationships with one another. First, European states and the US need to recognise that there is no going back to the world before February 2022. On issues of strategic stability, cooperation, energy security, and indulgence towards the oligarch money that has corrupted their politics, there has to be a commitment to permanent change.</p> \n<p>Some of this is already happening, but there will be pressure from other governments, lobbyists of various kinds, and from public opinion in an era of rising living costs, to undo many of the recent changes as quickly as possible, particularly in relation to sanctions. This would be a mistake, not least because Putin would be likely to see it as further confirmation of western weakness and disunity \u2013 a longstanding assumption in his foreign policy, and one of the factors that seems to have led to his huge miscalculation in Ukraine.</p> \n<p>Western states also need to acknowledge how badly they miscalculated both their relationship with Russia and the international significance of Russia\u2019s relations with its post-Soviet neighbours. Too often in the 30 years since the collapse of the USSR, the US, the UK and others have treated Russia as little more than an irritating obstacle to getting on with the more serious business of world politics in the Middle East or east Asia. At the same time, some European states clearly prioritised energy relations with Russia over questions about where Russian foreign policy was heading.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"66e575e087078af81e7acce2a7e14172b0b93037\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66e575e087078af81e7acce2a7e14172b0b93037/0_0_3505_2478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration showing the St Basil\u2019s Cathedral, a tank and a woman holding a sign reading \u2018This is not Russia-Ukraine war, this is Putin\u2019s war\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"707\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by Lynsey Irvine/Observer Design.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Lynsey Irvine / Observer Design</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As a result, and because of a shameful view that what was happening in Ukraine or Belarus or the South Caucasus was not really a significant concern for Europe and the US, they failed both to properly respond to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/was-it-inevitable-a-short-history-of-russias-war-on-ukraine\" title=\"\">first wave of Russian aggression against Ukraine in 2014</a>, or to think seriously enough about the implications for wider European security.</p> \n<p>Those implications can hardly be overstated. The reaction to the war in Ukraine has shown that despite the repeated claims of the past two decades, it is only now that a line has been drawn under the post-cold war period. For the first time since the late 1980s, western states are being forced to confront the fact that a wider European war is possible (though still unlikely), and that it would involve conflict between states with nuclear weapons.</p> \n<p>The gravity of the risks means that there needs to be an urgent recommitment to Nato as a defensive military alliance, including a commitment by all members to meet their obligations on defence spending. Those European states that have not joined, particularly those close to Russia, need to decide whether or not they want to remain outside the bloc in an era without the relatively stable rules of the cold war and where the ambiguity of the past 30 years is a vanished luxury. Neutrality is largely in the eye of the beholder, and if the Kremlin regards states as <em>de facto</em> allies of the US, lack of Nato membership is unlikely to protect them from whatever forms of aggression it will be capable of after Ukraine.</p> \n<p>The issue of relations with the other European states of the former Soviet Union also needs to be treated as a priority. One of the triggers for Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine seems to have been the mixed signalling over Ukraine\u2019s Nato membership, which was neither ruled out nor firmly ruled in. Nato and the EU both need to decide, and to communicate clearly, whether they plan to admit the remaining post-Soviet states that want to become members, and what the relationship with them will look like if they don\u2019t.</p> \n<p>At the same time, even if it is unpalatable to talk about it now, there will also need to be engagement with the Russian government in some areas, as there was between the west and the USSR even in dark periods of the cold war such as the early 1980s.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d1ecde6c45ba8d2556cf173e3129a0a4d40225e1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1ecde6c45ba8d2556cf173e3129a0a4d40225e1/0_137_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protester holds a placard reading \u201cPutin, Stop!\u201d at a rally in Kyiv\u2019s Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square), March 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protester holds a placard reading \u2018Putin, Stop!\u2019 at a rally in Kyiv\u2019s Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square), March 2014.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergey Dolzhenko/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The most important area will probably be nuclear arms control. The western debate about a no-fly zone and the Russian government\u2019s inflammatory, if vague, threats about nuclear weapons are a sharp reminder of the threat of escalation between nuclear superpowers \u2013 a threat that, worryingly, many seemed to have forgotten or dismissed. However hostile the relationship between Russia and the west becomes, dialogue on nuclear matters needs to be maintained.</p> \n<p>Similarly, some level of continuing military-to-military diplomatic contact on other issues will remain important \u2013 more important, in fact, than it has been in periods of better relations. Channels of communication between militaries are important for reducing the risk of miscalculation, even where they are unlikely to build much trust.</p> \n<p>Finally, the west will need to think about how it tries to engage with Russian society. Closing off all contact will simply confirm Putin\u2019s narrative that the west wants to destroy Russia. States need to keep their doors open to Russians who want to study or visit, as well as those who are escaping repression.</p> \n<p>None of this is going to be easy, and much of it may fall foul of domestic pressures, wishful thinking, and splits within the EU and Nato. But Europe and the US\u2019s future security depends on recognising that we are in a moment of acute danger, and that we are all in it together.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"56d0d6f031982d811a1124c80104b27e03b7a7d6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56d0d6f031982d811a1124c80104b27e03b7a7d6/0_0_1024_1279/801.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Pomerantsev.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Peter Pomerantsev: \u2018Solving the problem means confronting the psychological grip he has on people\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Peter Pomerantsev</strong><strong> is the author of</strong><em><strong> </strong></em><em><strong>Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia</strong></em><em><strong> </strong></em><strong>and</strong><em><strong> </strong></em><em><strong>This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality</strong></em><em><strong> </strong></em><strong>(Faber)</strong></p> \n<p>Last Monday, a senior producer at the primetime Russian state news programme ran on to the set as it was being broadcast live and waved a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/marina-ovsyannikova-russian-journalist-fined-for-live-broadcast-protest\">placard protesting against Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine</a> and encouraging the audience to disbelieve her own channel\u2019s propaganda. She was soon hauled off set and disappeared for two days into police custody. She described her act as a desperate attempt to cleanse her conscience for having \u201czombified\u201d the Russian people.</p> \n<p>Some have called her a hero, others say it is too little too late. But whatever your take, ultimately solving the Putin problem and creating change in Russia means confronting the psychological grip he has on his own people. The mental model of Putinism, the worldview it constructs with propaganda of word and deed to keep Russians under control, is built on several foundations: it appeals to nostalgia; it projects a conspiratorial perspective and it insists that Putin can get away with anything, that there is no alternative to Putin. As oppositionally minded Russians, pro-democracy media, civil society activists and public diplomats from the west seek to engage the Russian people, they need to take into account the strengths and weaknesses of these foundations. Even if Putin manages to cut off the Russian internet even further (he has already shut down Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and the last independent radio and online television stations), there will always be ways to reach the Russian people, from virtual private networks to satellite TV. The question is what to talk to them about.</p> \n<p>Currently, most Russians back the war and Putin\u2019s reasons for it. It\u2019s hard to trust polls in a dictatorship where you get 12 years in jail for mentioning the word \u201cwar\u201d. Moreover, it\u2019s always nice to hide behind propaganda: pretending you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on allows you to avoid responsibility and make any tough or dangerous decisions. But even if these cognitive biases, fears and motivations to dodge reality don\u2019t shift immediately there are already vulnerabilities in Putin\u2019s main propaganda strategies.</p> \n<p>Let\u2019s start with Putin\u2019s uses of nostalgia. His mission has always been to \u201cbring Russia off its knees\u201d, the Kremlin version of \u201cmake America great again\u201d. This has now reached a climax: in his rambling historical speech validating the invasion of Ukraine he invoked his mission to restore the Russian empire, and framed his war in terms of a second world war redux to battle (utterly mythical) Nazis.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"36dc96c7-b296-4d09-961d-905385d2700e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/D_MG0os17XM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Apart from the pleasures of wallowing in (often fictional) past glories, this nostalgia propaganda is effective psychologically in other ways too. It posits that the great Russian people have been humiliated by malign outside powers, and now Putin is restoring pride. The most important humiliation Russians experience, both historically and currently, is of course internal. But the nostalgia narrative allows the Kremlin to transfer its own brutality on to a shadowy outside \u201cenemy\u201d, and then help people relieve their pent-up anger through aggression. The abusive, sadistic tone of Putin\u2019s speeches, and the ones of his leading TV propagandists such as Vladimir Solovyov, give people an emotional path to articulate and validate their darkest and most violent feelings. It\u2019s OK to be vicious and mean, this propaganda implies, it\u2019s all history\u2019s fault.</p> \n<p>But this nostalgia propaganda also exists to cover up Putin\u2019s great achilles heel: his lack of a vision for the future. The future has long disappeared from Russian political discourse. Thinking about the future means concentrating on political reforms, cleaning up the courts, abolishing corruption \u2013 all things Putin cannot achieve, as they will put his own system in danger. With the new economic reality post-invasion, any hope for the future has been eradicated completely. But people will still think about it. What do the sanctions, which are yet to properly kick in, mean for their children\u2019s futures?</p> \n<p>Media and communication with the Russian people needs to focus on these questions about the future. Both on the personal level, but also in terms of the future of the country. What, ultimately, should the future role of Russia be in the world? One of the most resonant phrases on Russia media runs: \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of the world if there\u2019s no place for Russia in it?\u201d The \u201cRussia\u201d this invokes is imperial, its identity tied to crushing others. Is there another way?</p> \n<p>To further open up such questions, a group of Russian academics led by historian Alexander Etkind propose to create a university in the Baltics that will bring students from Russia and its neighbours to work on common challenges such as the environment. Projects like these are of course long-term aims, but without the language and ideas with which to talk about the future we can\u2019t even start to chart the way towards it.</p> \n<p>This idea of a future Russia has to be developed in partnership with Russia\u2019s neighbours, so that it balances the needs of all of them, and escapes the conspiratorial, zero-sum vision of the world Putin\u2019s propaganda promotes. Conspiracy thinking is another foundation of Putin\u2019s playbook. It serves many uses. Conspiratorial thinking helps solidify community, promoting a sense of \u201cus\u201d under attack from \u201cthem\u201d. It helps explain a confusing world. It also removes any sense of responsibility. Big new posters around Moscow claim that Russia \u201cwasn\u2019t given any choice\u201d but to start the war, implying it\u2019s all the fault of enemy powers. Ultimately, conspiracy thinking also spreads a sense that people are powerless to change anything in the world, which in turn seeds passivity. This can often be beneficial to the Kremlin: it wants a docile country.</p> \n<p>But this sort of thinking can also work against the government. It feeds a culture of suspicion and distrust. Thus, during Covid Russians refused to take the Kremlin\u2019s vaccine, suspecting the government itself was somehow plotting something malign against them.</p> \n<p>As the sanctions take effect, and if people become painfully aware that their experience is far more arduous than that of the elites, a crisis in motivation could kick in. Putin\u2019s system has always motivated people by giving them a piece in the overall cake of everyday corruption: from the traffic cop up to the minister. As long as you showed your loyalty occasionally, you were free to pursue your own financial aims. Now that motivation is gone, and you\u2019re meant to make great sacrifices for a conspiratorial pseudo-ideology. People could simply give up on keeping the system going. This is what happened at the end of the USSR, when many people basically stopped fulfilling their professional responsibilities. Not so much a strike as just lack of motivation and despondence.</p> \n<p>Revealing this disparity between the elites and normal people will require independent, investigative Russian journalism. Since the war, however, much of this is largely based abroad. They will have to rely on tracing documents and open-source investigations. We will need a whole new iteration of what the Russian journalist and editor Roman Badanin, founder of the investigative online media outlet Agentstvo, calls \u201coffshore journalism\u201d: exile media that uses modern tools to stay as close to the home country as possible.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/defiant-to-the-last-moscows-media-star-takes-aim-at-putins-brutal-clampdown\">Defiant to the last, Moscow\u2019s media star takes aim at Putin\u2019s brutal clampdown </a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As the economic situation worsens, and the propaganda weakens, Putin will turn to the power ministries to use oppression rather than ideas. This has always been his final argument: that he can carry out any crimes at home, any invasion abroad, any war crime from Grozny to Aleppo, and get away with it. In Ukraine, Putin is purposefully targeting humanitarian corridors, bombing refugees and hospitals in order to break the will of the people. It\u2019s a message to the world that all statements about humanitarian values, the UN\u2019s \u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d, \u201csafe zones\u201d is guff. His argument is that might is right, and in the futureless new world the ones who are most ruthless, from Beijing to Riyadh and Moscow, will flourish.</p> \n<p>One small, first, but hopefully important step has been taken by the human rights lawyer and author Philippe Sands, who is trying to create a Nuremberg-style tribunal for those who began this war, not merely for war crimes but for having started a completely unprovoked invasion in the first place. In the meantime, however, there\u2019s a joke going round pro-Putin circles inside Russia:</p> \n<p>Two Russian soldiers are drinking champagne in Russian-occupied Paris, the whole of Europe conquered. \u201cDid you hear?\u201d one smiles to the other. \u201cWe lost the information war.\u201d Such humour is its own form of propaganda: helping push Russians away from the thought that the \u201cspecial operation\u201d isn\u2019t going quite as planned. But it highlights a deeper truth: in wartime, propaganda of the deed outweighs propaganda of the word.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>This article was amended on 21 March to correct an error in Ruth Deyermond\u2019s job title</p></li> \n</ul>",

      "bodyText": "Tom Burgis: \u2018To confront his kleptocracy, we must first cease our complicity in it\u2019 Tom Burgis is investigations correspondent at the Financial Times and author of Kleptopia (William Collins) There lived a man whose land was rich with oil and gas but who grew up surrounded by poverty and knew every day that things could, and periodically did, fall apart. He joined the security forces then entered public service. That is the wrong term: he began to participate in the looting that is the incessant occupation of those who hold public office in his country. This became his life\u2019s work, to remain an insider, not to tumble from the enclave of wealth and safety into the turbulent world outside. He grew rich. He rose. He grew richer. So did those on whom he bestowed his favour, those he licensed to loot. They fawned over him, told of his greatness. As for the rest, those in whose name he ruled, there was no need to seek their consent. Instead, to maintain control, he fed them fear while promising the antidote. They are coming, the others, those who wish us harm, wish to take what we have, but I will keep you safe. It was a double life: he was at once the thief and the guard. The man I have in mind was the governor of a Nigerian state. As he guzzled petro-dollars, villages burned in his name. But this sketch applies, with only minor variations, to many of the world\u2019s rulers. From the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to Kazakhstan, most countries\u2019 principal way of making money in the global economy is by selling its basic ingredients: fuel, metals precious and industrial, certain stones. The proceeds are at the disposal of whoever holds power. They take what they want, then hire bankers and lawyers to remove their fingerprints from the loot and stash it in rich countries. They have no need to raise taxes from their own people, so their own people have no way to call them to account. Corruption is the opposite of consent. Vladimir Putin\u2019s eligibility for this club of kleptocrats comes across in First Person, a book written by three Russian journalists shortly after Putin became president in 2000, based on interviews with him, his wife and some of his friends. Growing up with rats and abysmal toilets, Putin dreamed of a place in the Soviet empire\u2019s boss class as an officer in the organisation that protected its power, the KGB. One Easter, Putin, then a young recruit, was policing a religious procession outside a church. \u201cHe asked me,\u201d a cellist friend recalls, \u201cwhether I wanted to go up to the altar and take a look. Of course I agreed. There was such boyishness in his gesture \u2013 \u2018nobody can go there, but we can.\u2019\u201d Later, a drunk student asked to bum a cigarette. Putin, a judo champion, said no, then flung the student to the ground. Power is for getting things others cannot have; if others ask for something you do not wish to give, respond with violence. Posted to Dresden, Putin lived with his young family in a serviced apartment. There was a driver, good beer, hotdogs in the countryside at weekends. Then the Berlin Wall fell. Angry crowds massed outside the KGB station. He contacted his commanders and was told: \u201cMoscow is silent.\u201d The old order had fallen; he needed to join the new one. He went home to St Petersburg and secured a position in the local government with powers to decide who was allowed to make money by dealing with western capitalists. Naturally, he decided that this should be him and his cronies. He rose. Within a decade, he was president. He took his gang of kleptocrats with him to the Kremlin. (Some of them, such as Igor Sechin, are now on sanctions lists.) The rulers of the west applied the same logic to Putin as they applied to the rulers of DRC or Kazakhstan. They wanted to buy these countries\u2019 commodities so they pretended the kleptocrats were legitimate leaders with whom they could do business. They kept this up when he murdered exiled dissidents abroad, when he stole South Ossetia in 2008 and Crimea in 2014, all the while developing a tribal imperialist spiel to stir fealty at home. After 22 years of this, Putin evidently believes his own propaganda that he is a statesman, rather than a character from The Godfather. As his forces devastate Ukraine, I asked a Russian former intelligence officer what Putin wants. \u201cRespect,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about respect.\u201d As well as accepting that we have so emboldened him that we may well have to meet him on the battlefield, to confront Putin\u2019s kleptocracy, we must first cease our complicity in it. What do we think happens to the money we pay for Russian gas? How do we imagine western multinationals secure oil-drilling rights dispensed by a regime we know to be corrupt? Who do we think is behind the companies of anonymous ownership, registered in places like Guernsey, Cyprus and the British Virgin Islands, that we continue to allow to participate in our economies? The Panama Papers revealed that one of the human beings behind the corporate camouflage was the cellist Putin took to see a forbidden altar. Somehow he amassed a secret fortune that ran to millions. We have known the answers to these questions for a long time but it was just too lucrative to tell ourselves we didn\u2019t. Twin pipelines of money sustain Putin and his fellow kleptocrats. One carries western money into kleptocracies to pay for natural resources; the other carries money back out again, after it\u2019s been stolen, for safekeeping in the west\u2019s property markets and universities and political parties. If we wish to weaken him and his system of corrupt power, we must disrupt both pipelines. That means increasing and sustaining the reduction in our consumption of Russian oil and gas. If we do not wish merely to switch our support for one kleptocracy to others, we must replace this energy supply with something other than the fossil fuels that are the lifeblood of kleptocrats everywhere. As for the second pipeline, our noisy declarations that we are turning it off \u2013 that, as Boris Johnson put it, \u201cthere is no place for dirty money in the UK\u201d \u2013 are laughable. A few names on sanctions lists and some loophole-ridden reforms to economic crime laws not backed by budgets to enforce them are close to meaningless while we still permit financial secrecy. Nonetheless, the danger is that by throwing more and more people out of the global economy, we hasten the creation of a shadow one. Sanctions-busting deals between Iran, Venezuela and Russia \u2013 respectively kleptocracies with Islamist, socialist and imperialist masks \u2013 reveal that this alternative is already taking shape. The leaders of the Chinese kleptocracy will use this opportunity to bolster their position at the head of this new order. We are watching the rise of what I\u2019ve called Kleptopia. An undeclared, unconventional war between kleptocracy and democracy has been under way since long before Putin\u2019s troops marched into Ukraine. The two sides are not arranged merely by geography. The kleptocrats have plenty of allies in the west, from the lawyers shielding their plunder to the politicians advancing their influence within democratic governments. Their victims include both Ukrainian civilians and Russian conscripts. With whom do we stand? Catriona Kelly: \u2018We must try to understand the complex history of Russian imperialism\u2019 Catriona Kelly is honorary professor of Russian and Soviet culture and senior research fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge and the author of St Petersburg: Shadows of the Past (Yale) I left St Petersburg on 22 February 2022, reaching London just 27 hours before Russian troops crossed the borders into Ukraine. For days, I\u2019d been sure the invasion would happen. The question was, on what scale. I\u2019d read speculation in the Russian press about intent to occupy the whole country. Surely that wasn\u2019t possible? All the same, with Petersburg friends I drank the old Soviet toast \u201cTo Peace!\u201d \u2013 speaking in lowered voices. What has happened since has destroyed hope and confirmed fear. This unprovoked, brutal and bungled attack on a near neighbour has been Russia\u2019s worst foreign policy disaster in decades. For those of us who know and love Ukraine, but also love Russia, it\u2019s a personal as well as a human tragedy. Large numbers of Russians don\u2019t support the war. It\u2019s an attack on Russia\u2019s independence too. Many are fleeing from their increasingly hostile homeland \u2013 wherever flights still operate and borders are open. Much as I share Tolstoy\u2019s scepticism about the individual\u2019s impact on history, to a significant extent this is Vladimir Putin\u2019s war. Determined to reverse the entropy for which he blames Gorbachev, Putin believes in the transhistorical unity of Great Russia, Little Russia and White Russia. Ukraine as such does not exist. At best, \u201cLittle Russia\u201d is a province that is entitled to its own picturesque traditions. But autonomy equals disloyalty. Those who seek it are \u201cNazis\u201d. The term assimilates campaigners for Ukrainian independence to the invaders routed by the Soviet Union (for which read, Russia) in the great patriotic war between 1941 and 1945. At the same time, it erases from the record the crucial contribution to victory in that war of Ukrainians themselves. Only such wilful forgetting could allow Putin, a Leningrader, to inflict on Kharkiv, Mariupol, Kyiv and Mykolaiv the siege warfare that devastated his birthplace in 1941-1944. After 1991, Russian politicians rapidly learned from the west how to govern by spin. The 2012 campaign to restore \u201cspiritual ties\u201d, much mocked by big-city sophisticates, was as focus-group-oriented as anything dreamed up by Dominic Cummings. It spoke to those who felt that globalisation had left them behind, when even goods made in Russia often came from factories owned by international corporations: Danone, Ford, Ikea, Heineken. When Putin first started talking about the historic unity of Russia and Ukraine, in the spring of 2014, this too seemed expedient, an attempt to justify post factum the impromptu annexation of Crimea. The first anniversary of the annexation once past, the rhetoric died down. But in the summer of 2021, Putin\u2019s \u201chistorical unity\u201d talk surfaced in deadly earnest. A precipitating factor seems to have been the 2020 election protests in Belarus. If that could happen in a country whose loyalty to Russia seemed absolute, where would \u201cexternal powers\u201d (Putin doesn\u2019t believe in dissent without them) get to work next? The first difficulty in solving \u201cthe Putin problem\u201d is thus that Putin is determined to defeat and purge independent Ukraine. Peace talks have been an iteration of certainties by Russian delegates set on a no-compromise position. Typical is Vladimir Medinsky, the former culture minister, an ideologue of Russian supremacism supported by bad history. It is tempting to think that if Putin and his allies were to disappear, a rational solution would emerge. Yet substantial sections of the population still support Putin: those who share his prejudices about Ukraine; those convinced the west is out to destroy Russia; those for whom things have got better since 1991; those terrified things may get worse. Putin, unlike Maria in The Sound of Music, isn\u2019t a problem with an easy solution. But let\u2019s concentrate on what may be achievable. Here\u2019s a brief and imperfect list: Push for proper peace talks, accompanied by a full ceasefire, and with participation in the talks of observers trusted by both sides. As the war drags on and casualties mount, and the economic costs begin to bite, there could be a change of heart on the Russian side. There are some signs of disunity at the top even now. Listen to voices from the region. A good place to start is Ukrainian activist and historian Taras Bilous\u2019s essay, A Letter to the Western Left from Kyiv (published recently on openDemocracy), which corrects many of the British media cliches about insuperable linguistic, cultural, historical and geographical divides and the influence of the far right. Recognise the efforts, at great personal cost, of the Russians who oppose the war: the demonstrators exposed to police beatings; the artists and administrators who resign from their jobs; the priests who speak up in their sermons when the hierarchy is silent; a few members of the business elite. Don\u2019t organise blanket boycotts by citizenship. Don\u2019t organise boycotts by place of origin either. Rather than ostracising works of art, try to understand the complex history of Russian imperialism. Pushkin\u2019s To the Slanderers of Russia (1831) told western critics that Russia\u2019s repression of Poland was a family affair. But Evdokiya Rostopchina\u2019s The Forced Marriage (1845) presented Russia and Poland as an abusive husband and defiant wife \u2013 provoking outrage in Nicholas I. Keep up the remarkable outpouring of support for Ukraine. Make sure the media caravans and flashmobs don\u2019t just gallop on to the next sensation. After the campaign for peace with honour, there must be generous aid from the west to help Ukrainians rebuild their devastated cities and the democracy that they are fighting so hard to preserve. In an address to the nation, the Russian Union of Rectors described Putin\u2019s decision to embark on the \u201cmilitary operation\u201d as \u201cborn of suffering\u201d. When I think of suffering, I don\u2019t see a small man sitting alone at the end of a long table. I see people sheltered in basements and metro stations, separated from their loved ones and their friends, or fleeing from their homes under gunfire. A Ukrainian friend, a gifted literary critic, snatched a book as she and her husband left Kyiv. She later found it was The Sound and the Fury. It couldn\u2019t better have suited the mood among those opposed to the war, who are eloquent in their outrage. Maybe Tolstoy was right after all: it is the apparently powerful who lack full humanity, and not those whom they try to harm. Oliver Bullough: \u2018We can deprive him and his cronies of access to their wealth\u2019 Oliver Bullough is the author of Moneyland: Why Thieves and Crooks Now Rule the World and How to Take It Back. His new book is Butler to the World (Profile) All the horror that Putin is unleashing \u2013 the death, the lies, the violence, the refugees trudging through landscapes bleached of their colour by snow and artillery \u2013 echoes the 1940s. Putin himself calls the Ukrainians Nazis, as if this unprovoked aggression is somehow a rerun of the Soviet people\u2019s self-defence in the second world war. That accusation is disgusting, but it\u2019s harder to dismiss the parallels between Putin\u2019s own behaviour and those of the dictators of the mid-20th century. He is driven by a perverse misreading of history to deny his neighbours\u2019 humanity. Russian officials and politicians are aggressive in their patriotism. The orange-and-black striped medal ribbon became the nationalist symbol when Putin invaded Ukraine in 2014, and the air-recognition-mark \u201cZ\u201d has rapidly morphed into an equivalent for this new war. Putin is a bully who invades his neighbours and kills his critics, and whose government lies compulsively, even about facts that are so self-evidently true that denying them seems self-defeating. He is even driving his tanks through Ukraine, the second world war\u2019s main battleground. In the circumstances, how could our understanding of Putin not be filtered through 20th-century history? And of course there are lessons for us from that time \u2013 about the futility of appeasement, and the heroism of ordinary humans caught up in inhumanity. But Putin is not Hitler or Benito Mussolini, he is not even Joseph Stalin, he is a modern problem, and solving a problem like him requires new skills, new sacrifices, and new laws. In the first place, the Russian elite\u2019s patriotism and anti-western posturing is performative. The anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny has made a cottage industry of revealing how top-ranking officials or regime propagandists have property in countries that are the supposed enemy. After a hard week campaigning against the evil west, which is undermining Christian civilisation by allowing gay people to get married, they would fly to their villas in Italy or their townhouses in London. They may think they believe what they say, but their actions belie them: the ideology is just cant to confuse foreigners and keep Russians in line. Russia is an astonishingly unequal country, with the elite owning a share of wealth as great as, if not greater than, that owned by pre-revolutionary aristocrats. These kleptocrats exploited connections in government to gain lucrative contracts or state property, but they don\u2019t trust the legal system, which waved through this monstrous spate of theft, any more than any other Russian does. That is why they have moved at least half of their wealth out of Russia, and spent it on houses, yachts, football clubs, fine art and more. Their investment managers have been in London, Luxembourg and New York, and complement the harder skills that the oligarchs learned in Russia\u2019s business climate. What would Russia be without these offshore services? It would be a fading power with a declining population run by an ageing political class loyal to a dead empire. Its sole world-class assets are its resources of oil, gas and minerals, many of which will become irrelevant in the decarbonised world we are moving towards. The USSR\u2019s soft power was once enormous, with its communist ideology, sublime ballet companies, film directors and musicians. But what does the Kremlin have now? A misinformation machine and an unequal alliance with a Chinese elite that must be looking at Russia\u2019s riches and licking their lips. Putin claims to be defending the rights of Russian-speakers everywhere, yet during the pandemic, Russia had the worst rate of excess deaths of any country, a rate twice as bad as that of the United States and three times as bad as Britain\u2019s. If he truly cared about the nation he serves, he would be focusing on Russia\u2019s healthcare catastrophe instead of sending its sons to die in Ukraine. We cannot solve the problem of Putin; only the Russians can do that. But we can stop helping him be a bigger problem than he has to be. The first step is to deprive him and his cronies of their access to our financial system. Being able to bury their wealth deep in our economies has allowed Russia\u2019s rulers to avoid the consequences of their own greed: their children have studied in English schools; their wealth has been invested in western funds; their German-built yachts fly under the flags of British tax havens. The way to do this is to strip them of the shield they can gain from opaque shell companies. Britain\u2019s tax havens have sold secrecy to anyone able to afford it, while the UK\u2019s Companies House has provided the cover for hundreds of billions of pounds of stolen wealth to flow out of Russia. When the shield over assets is lifted, we must give our law enforcement agencies the resources they need to investigate the assets\u2019 provenance, and confiscate anything of criminal origin. Stripped of their access to the international financial system and of their stolen riches, Putin\u2019s oligarchs will be not plutocrats but thugs. Deprived of their boltholes, they will be forced either to improve Russia for everyone that lives in it, or they will be swept from power. Ruth Deyermond: \u2018Closing contact will confirm Putin\u2019s narrative that the west wants to destroy Russia\u2019 Ruth Deyermond is senior lecturer in post-Soviet security in the Department of War Studies, King\u2019s College London Although Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine is less than a month old, the debate about what will come after it is already starting to emerge. So far, the war appears to be going very badly for Russia. Its assumptions about the country it chose to invade have been exposed as fatally flawed; years of expensive military reform have failed to produce an army capable of effectively fighting a war of choice; and it has had to deny asking the Chinese government to feed and arm its troops. Despite this litany of humiliations, the relative strength of the Russian armed forces mean that a military victory can\u2019t be ruled out. There would probably be continued resistance, forcing Russia to choose between draining its catastrophically damaged economy and military capabilities in an open-ended occupation, and a withdrawal. Unless sanctions are lifted, its most important trading and diplomatic relationships \u2013 above all, with China \u2013 will be firmly tilted in favour of its partners, who will be able to deal with Russia on much more favourable terms than in the past. Whatever happens in Ukraine, it seems likely that Putin will remain in power for the foreseeable future. Nothing about his behaviour in the past decade has indicated that he would be willing to give up power voluntarily, and it seems unlikely that those in the best position to remove him will do so, not least because they are themselves closely tied to Putin and his crimes. This raises the question of how western states respond to a Putin-led Russia and how they organise their relationships with one another. First, European states and the US need to recognise that there is no going back to the world before February 2022. On issues of strategic stability, cooperation, energy security, and indulgence towards the oligarch money that has corrupted their politics, there has to be a commitment to permanent change. Some of this is already happening, but there will be pressure from other governments, lobbyists of various kinds, and from public opinion in an era of rising living costs, to undo many of the recent changes as quickly as possible, particularly in relation to sanctions. This would be a mistake, not least because Putin would be likely to see it as further confirmation of western weakness and disunity \u2013 a longstanding assumption in his foreign policy, and one of the factors that seems to have led to his huge miscalculation in Ukraine. Western states also need to acknowledge how badly they miscalculated both their relationship with Russia and the international significance of Russia\u2019s relations with its post-Soviet neighbours. Too often in the 30 years since the collapse of the USSR, the US, the UK and others have treated Russia as little more than an irritating obstacle to getting on with the more serious business of world politics in the Middle East or east Asia. At the same time, some European states clearly prioritised energy relations with Russia over questions about where Russian foreign policy was heading. As a result, and because of a shameful view that what was happening in Ukraine or Belarus or the South Caucasus was not really a significant concern for Europe and the US, they failed both to properly respond to the first wave of Russian aggression against Ukraine in 2014, or to think seriously enough about the implications for wider European security. Those implications can hardly be overstated. The reaction to the war in Ukraine has shown that despite the repeated claims of the past two decades, it is only now that a line has been drawn under the post-cold war period. For the first time since the late 1980s, western states are being forced to confront the fact that a wider European war is possible (though still unlikely), and that it would involve conflict between states with nuclear weapons. The gravity of the risks means that there needs to be an urgent recommitment to Nato as a defensive military alliance, including a commitment by all members to meet their obligations on defence spending. Those European states that have not joined, particularly those close to Russia, need to decide whether or not they want to remain outside the bloc in an era without the relatively stable rules of the cold war and where the ambiguity of the past 30 years is a vanished luxury. Neutrality is largely in the eye of the beholder, and if the Kremlin regards states as de facto allies of the US, lack of Nato membership is unlikely to protect them from whatever forms of aggression it will be capable of after Ukraine. The issue of relations with the other European states of the former Soviet Union also needs to be treated as a priority. One of the triggers for Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine seems to have been the mixed signalling over Ukraine\u2019s Nato membership, which was neither ruled out nor firmly ruled in. Nato and the EU both need to decide, and to communicate clearly, whether they plan to admit the remaining post-Soviet states that want to become members, and what the relationship with them will look like if they don\u2019t. At the same time, even if it is unpalatable to talk about it now, there will also need to be engagement with the Russian government in some areas, as there was between the west and the USSR even in dark periods of the cold war such as the early 1980s. The most important area will probably be nuclear arms control. The western debate about a no-fly zone and the Russian government\u2019s inflammatory, if vague, threats about nuclear weapons are a sharp reminder of the threat of escalation between nuclear superpowers \u2013 a threat that, worryingly, many seemed to have forgotten or dismissed. However hostile the relationship between Russia and the west becomes, dialogue on nuclear matters needs to be maintained. Similarly, some level of continuing military-to-military diplomatic contact on other issues will remain important \u2013 more important, in fact, than it has been in periods of better relations. Channels of communication between militaries are important for reducing the risk of miscalculation, even where they are unlikely to build much trust. Finally, the west will need to think about how it tries to engage with Russian society. Closing off all contact will simply confirm Putin\u2019s narrative that the west wants to destroy Russia. States need to keep their doors open to Russians who want to study or visit, as well as those who are escaping repression. None of this is going to be easy, and much of it may fall foul of domestic pressures, wishful thinking, and splits within the EU and Nato. But Europe and the US\u2019s future security depends on recognising that we are in a moment of acute danger, and that we are all in it together. Peter Pomerantsev: \u2018Solving the problem means confronting the psychological grip he has on people\u2019 Peter Pomerantsev is the author of Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia and This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality (Faber) Last Monday, a senior producer at the primetime Russian state news programme ran on to the set as it was being broadcast live and waved a placard protesting against Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and encouraging the audience to disbelieve her own channel\u2019s propaganda. She was soon hauled off set and disappeared for two days into police custody. She described her act as a desperate attempt to cleanse her conscience for having \u201czombified\u201d the Russian people. Some have called her a hero, others say it is too little too late. But whatever your take, ultimately solving the Putin problem and creating change in Russia means confronting the psychological grip he has on his own people. The mental model of Putinism, the worldview it constructs with propaganda of word and deed to keep Russians under control, is built on several foundations: it appeals to nostalgia; it projects a conspiratorial perspective and it insists that Putin can get away with anything, that there is no alternative to Putin. As oppositionally minded Russians, pro-democracy media, civil society activists and public diplomats from the west seek to engage the Russian people, they need to take into account the strengths and weaknesses of these foundations. Even if Putin manages to cut off the Russian internet even further (he has already shut down Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and the last independent radio and online television stations), there will always be ways to reach the Russian people, from virtual private networks to satellite TV. The question is what to talk to them about. Currently, most Russians back the war and Putin\u2019s reasons for it. It\u2019s hard to trust polls in a dictatorship where you get 12 years in jail for mentioning the word \u201cwar\u201d. Moreover, it\u2019s always nice to hide behind propaganda: pretending you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on allows you to avoid responsibility and make any tough or dangerous decisions. But even if these cognitive biases, fears and motivations to dodge reality don\u2019t shift immediately there are already vulnerabilities in Putin\u2019s main propaganda strategies. Let\u2019s start with Putin\u2019s uses of nostalgia. His mission has always been to \u201cbring Russia off its knees\u201d, the Kremlin version of \u201cmake America great again\u201d. This has now reached a climax: in his rambling historical speech validating the invasion of Ukraine he invoked his mission to restore the Russian empire, and framed his war in terms of a second world war redux to battle (utterly mythical) Nazis. Apart from the pleasures of wallowing in (often fictional) past glories, this nostalgia propaganda is effective psychologically in other ways too. It posits that the great Russian people have been humiliated by malign outside powers, and now Putin is restoring pride. The most important humiliation Russians experience, both historically and currently, is of course internal. But the nostalgia narrative allows the Kremlin to transfer its own brutality on to a shadowy outside \u201cenemy\u201d, and then help people relieve their pent-up anger through aggression. The abusive, sadistic tone of Putin\u2019s speeches, and the ones of his leading TV propagandists such as Vladimir Solovyov, give people an emotional path to articulate and validate their darkest and most violent feelings. It\u2019s OK to be vicious and mean, this propaganda implies, it\u2019s all history\u2019s fault. But this nostalgia propaganda also exists to cover up Putin\u2019s great achilles heel: his lack of a vision for the future. The future has long disappeared from Russian political discourse. Thinking about the future means concentrating on political reforms, cleaning up the courts, abolishing corruption \u2013 all things Putin cannot achieve, as they will put his own system in danger. With the new economic reality post-invasion, any hope for the future has been eradicated completely. But people will still think about it. What do the sanctions, which are yet to properly kick in, mean for their children\u2019s futures? Media and communication with the Russian people needs to focus on these questions about the future. Both on the personal level, but also in terms of the future of the country. What, ultimately, should the future role of Russia be in the world? One of the most resonant phrases on Russia media runs: \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of the world if there\u2019s no place for Russia in it?\u201d The \u201cRussia\u201d this invokes is imperial, its identity tied to crushing others. Is there another way? To further open up such questions, a group of Russian academics led by historian Alexander Etkind propose to create a university in the Baltics that will bring students from Russia and its neighbours to work on common challenges such as the environment. Projects like these are of course long-term aims, but without the language and ideas with which to talk about the future we can\u2019t even start to chart the way towards it. This idea of a future Russia has to be developed in partnership with Russia\u2019s neighbours, so that it balances the needs of all of them, and escapes the conspiratorial, zero-sum vision of the world Putin\u2019s propaganda promotes. Conspiracy thinking is another foundation of Putin\u2019s playbook. It serves many uses. Conspiratorial thinking helps solidify community, promoting a sense of \u201cus\u201d under attack from \u201cthem\u201d. It helps explain a confusing world. It also removes any sense of responsibility. Big new posters around Moscow claim that Russia \u201cwasn\u2019t given any choice\u201d but to start the war, implying it\u2019s all the fault of enemy powers. Ultimately, conspiracy thinking also spreads a sense that people are powerless to change anything in the world, which in turn seeds passivity. This can often be beneficial to the Kremlin: it wants a docile country. But this sort of thinking can also work against the government. It feeds a culture of suspicion and distrust. Thus, during Covid Russians refused to take the Kremlin\u2019s vaccine, suspecting the government itself was somehow plotting something malign against them. As the sanctions take effect, and if people become painfully aware that their experience is far more arduous than that of the elites, a crisis in motivation could kick in. Putin\u2019s system has always motivated people by giving them a piece in the overall cake of everyday corruption: from the traffic cop up to the minister. As long as you showed your loyalty occasionally, you were free to pursue your own financial aims. Now that motivation is gone, and you\u2019re meant to make great sacrifices for a conspiratorial pseudo-ideology. People could simply give up on keeping the system going. This is what happened at the end of the USSR, when many people basically stopped fulfilling their professional responsibilities. Not so much a strike as just lack of motivation and despondence. Revealing this disparity between the elites and normal people will require independent, investigative Russian journalism. Since the war, however, much of this is largely based abroad. They will have to rely on tracing documents and open-source investigations. We will need a whole new iteration of what the Russian journalist and editor Roman Badanin, founder of the investigative online media outlet Agentstvo, calls \u201coffshore journalism\u201d: exile media that uses modern tools to stay as close to the home country as possible. As the economic situation worsens, and the propaganda weakens, Putin will turn to the power ministries to use oppression rather than ideas. This has always been his final argument: that he can carry out any crimes at home, any invasion abroad, any war crime from Grozny to Aleppo, and get away with it. In Ukraine, Putin is purposefully targeting humanitarian corridors, bombing refugees and hospitals in order to break the will of the people. It\u2019s a message to the world that all statements about humanitarian values, the UN\u2019s \u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d, \u201csafe zones\u201d is guff. His argument is that might is right, and in the futureless new world the ones who are most ruthless, from Beijing to Riyadh and Moscow, will flourish. One small, first, but hopefully important step has been taken by the human rights lawyer and author Philippe Sands, who is trying to create a Nuremberg-style tribunal for those who began this war, not merely for war crimes but for having started a completely unprovoked invasion in the first place. In the meantime, however, there\u2019s a joke going round pro-Putin circles inside Russia: Two Russian soldiers are drinking champagne in Russian-occupied Paris, the whole of Europe conquered. \u201cDid you hear?\u201d one smiles to the other. \u201cWe lost the information war.\u201d Such humour is its own form of propaganda: helping push Russians away from the thought that the \u201cspecial operation\u201d isn\u2019t going quite as planned. But it highlights a deeper truth: in wartime, propaganda of the deed outweighs propaganda of the word. This article was amended on 21 March to correct an error in Ruth Deyermond\u2019s job title",

Escape!\u2019 But now, it\u2019s OK. He\u2019s much better now \u2013 much, much better. Both my children are very happy here, with Basma\u2019s children. Basma and Tom are very good people. They treat us like family,\u201d Sergei said. He is an experienced driver and is keen to get a job in the UK. \u201cIf war had not started, we would never have come. But I feel at home here in England. And I feel hope.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>My grandfather went to sea in his mid-teens. He served at the battle of Jutland \u2013 the Somme of the sea. In the Second World War, he worked on the Atlantic convoys, bringing food and supplies to a besieged Britain \u2013 the Stalingrad of the sea. Shortly after the war, the ship on which he was working as a stoker, the Cydonia, hit a stray mine and he was boiled alive when the engine blew up. The newspapers reported that the ship had been damaged \u201cwith the loss of one greaser\u201d. The same phrasing appears in the records of the shipping company. He\u2019s not named anywhere. He was commemorated not as a person but as a component.</p> <p>Which is how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/18/there-were-grown-men-in-tears-po-crews-stunned-by-sackings\">P&amp;O dealt with their employees</a> last week. All ships called in as if they were pedalos on a boating lake; security sent in to remove crews. So here we are, an island nation, our sea lanes closed just when every parish hall and spare room is filling up with toiletries and warm clothing that people were hoping to ship to Ukraine. The companies in Jason Reitman\u2019s film <em>Up in the Air</em> outsource uncomfortable sackings to a \u201ccorporate downsizer\u201d, played by George Clooney. That seemed far fetched at the time but P&amp;O didn\u2019t even bother with that. They sacked crews remotely, using a pre-recorded Teams message.</p> <p>The MP for Dover, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2022/mar/18/tory-mp-heckled-by-protesters-at-demonstration-against-po-ferries-in-dover-video-report\">Natalie Elphicke</a>, went down to the port to protest. Like your neighbourhood arsonist offering you a flask of tea over the smoking ruins of your house. She was met with shouts of \u201cshame on you\u201d from the sacked workers who understood, as perhaps she didn\u2019t, that this is not an aberration. This is the economy going to plan, as clearly outlined in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/sep/24/kwasi-kwarteng-from-britannia-unchained-to-business-secretary\">Britannia Unchained</a>,</em> a booklet cut and pasted together by five Tory MPs. (Elphicke, like her whole party, had voted against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2021/oct/22/anger-as-ministers-block-fire-and-rehire-bill-in-commons\">Barry Gardiner\u2019s fire and rehire bill</a> which might have prevented this.) It\u2019s a short book but if you read it you\u2019ll see that a decent editor could have got it down to one sentence. \u201cWhen we seek to protect the vulnerable we limit the freedom of the rich and the privileged \u2013 and that is a disgrace.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a wretched read \u2013 a series of assertions and hunches freed from the chains of argument or evidence, with the intellectual rigour of a YouTube conspiracy rant. The prose occasionally soars to the level of clickbait, as in its most famous sentence: \u201cThe British are among the worst idlers in the world.\u201d Most of its authors are now cabinet ministers in a government that no one would call exactly Stakhanovite.</p> <p>The transport secretary \u2013 who goes by the name of Grant Shapps and is not one of the infamous five \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10628555/Angry-Grant-Shapps-takes-aim-P-O-Ferries-scathing-letter-companys-chairman.html\">wrote a stiff letter</a> to the CEO of P&amp;O but was too exhausted by the effort to look up the chap\u2019s name and addressed it to someone who had retired a while back.</p> <p>The chains from which the booklet\u2019s authors want to free Britannia are, of course, those of regulation. The heroic age of regulation began at sea with Samuel Plimsoll\u2019s attempt to govern a shipping industry that had lobbied against laws to forbid overloading and lobbied for laws that imposed prison sentences on sailors who refused to join unseaworthy ships.</p> <p>Nicolette Jones\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jul/01/featuresreviews.guardianreview3\">brilliant biography</a> of Plimsoll, <em>The Plimsoll Sensation</em>, points out that the tactics used against him were both vicious and familiar. \u201cPlimsollism is terrorism,\u201d ran one headline. The royal commission that was eventually established was deliberately swamped with \u201cevidence\u201d about the impossibility of ever establishing a standard load line. It would just have to be left to the wisdom of shipowners, one of whom, the honourable member for Plymouth, was the owner of three ships that had been lost with all hands and two others that had been abandoned.</p> <p>It was simply cheaper to price in the deaths of thousands of crew than to sail safely. There\u2019s a school of thought that the market will make P&amp;O suffer for its bad behaviour, that customers will be appalled and not use them. It\u2019s true that the market does regulate the market, but it does so through catastrophe. It took the death of 80, many of them children, in a rail crash in Armagh in 1889 to make the case that train companies should be legally obliged to have brakes on carriages. In the 1870s, <em>The</em> <em>Daily Telegraph</em> revealed that one train guard had been found asleep on the job towards the end of a <em>40-hour</em> shift. The company had instructed the porter to nudge him awake whenever he dropped off.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve elected a prime minister who made his name as a kind of anti-regulation Roy Chubby Brown</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We are immediately angered by the casual sacking of British crews but we need to remember that the point of sacking them is to replace them with Filipino crews who can also be treated \u2013 like that guard \u2013 as components.</p> <p>We\u2019ve allowed a narrative to take hold in which regulation is seen as the enemy of the individual. Indeed, we\u2019ve elected a prime minister who made his name as a kind of anti-regulation Roy Chubby Brown.</p> <p>But historically, regulation is how we have established the importance of the human in the face of the machine. It\u2019s how we care for each other. It\u2019s always a fight. My friend, Michael Molloy, died in his teens when the coach he was travelling on crashed. The coach\u2019s tyres turned out to be older than he was. When his mother fought for regulation, the bill she campaigned for was thrown out by Chris Heaton-Harris, the current chief whip.</p> <p>P&amp;O is the logical outcome of the assault on the rules-based world that we tried to build after the war. It\u2019s a campaign for disconnection. Clooney\u2019s character in <em>Up in the Air</em> finds that he has somehow exchanged his own ability to make relationships for a pocket full of air miles. He wanders the world like an oligarch\u2019s super-yacht \u2013 always voyaging, never docking, in perpetual and pointless motion. All at sea. At our best we hunger for connection \u2013 it\u2019s why we wanted those ferries to take that warm clothing to Ukraine. Shortly after he was elected pope, Francis went to see the refugees in Lampedusa and talked about Lope de Vega\u2019s play <em>Fuenteovejuna</em>, in which an entire town gets rid of a tyrant of a governor by murdering him. All the inhabitants are complicit so none of them has to take responsibility.</p> <p>The former Peninsular and Oriental Steam Packet Company is now owned by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/18/dp-world-p-and-o-ownership-dubai\">DP World</a> \u2013 a \u201clogistics solutions\u201d organisation based in Dubai. Its power is rootless, mobile. The management of P&amp;O distanced themselves with tech, as though they were mere functions of their own software. Components. The chains that Truss and Raab and Patel are trying to cut are the chains that bind us to each other. The chains that tell us that we too are involved in catastrophes like Ukraine or the drownings in the Mediterranean. Cut those chains and we are all diminished.</p> <p>My grandad\u2019s name by the way was Thomas Boyce.</p> <ul> <li><p>Frank Cottrell-Boyce is a British screenwriter and novelist</p></li> </ul>",

She was met with shouts of \u201cshame on you\u201d from the sacked workers who understood, as perhaps she didn\u2019t, that this is not an aberration. This is the economy going to plan, as clearly outlined in Britannia Unchained, a booklet cut and pasted together by five Tory MPs. (Elphicke, like her whole party, had voted against Barry Gardiner\u2019s fire and rehire bill which might have prevented this.) It\u2019s a short book but if you read it you\u2019ll see that a decent editor could have got it down to one sentence. \u201cWhen we seek to protect the vulnerable we limit the freedom of the rich and the privileged \u2013 and that is a disgrace.\u201d It\u2019s a wretched read \u2013 a series of assertions and hunches freed from the chains of argument or evidence, with the intellectual rigour of a YouTube conspiracy rant. The prose occasionally soars to the level of clickbait, as in its most famous sentence: \u201cThe British are among the worst idlers in the world.\u201d Most of its authors are now cabinet ministers in a government that no one would call exactly Stakhanovite. The transport secretary \u2013 who goes by the name of Grant Shapps and is not one of the infamous five \u2013 wrote a stiff letter to the CEO of P&amp;O but was too exhausted by the effort to look up the chap\u2019s name and addressed it to someone who had retired a while back. The chains from which the booklet\u2019s authors want to free Britannia are, of course, those of regulation. The heroic age of regulation began at sea with Samuel Plimsoll\u2019s attempt to govern a shipping industry that had lobbied against laws to forbid overloading and lobbied for laws that imposed prison sentences on sailors who refused to join unseaworthy ships. Nicolette Jones\u2019s brilliant biography of Plimsoll, The Plimsoll Sensation, points out that the tactics used against him were both vicious and familiar. \u201cPlimsollism is terrorism,\u201d ran one headline. The royal commission that was eventually established was deliberately swamped with \u201cevidence\u201d about the impossibility of ever establishing a standard load line. It would just have to be left to the wisdom of shipowners, one of whom, the honourable member for Plymouth, was the owner of three ships that had been lost with all hands and two others that had been abandoned. It was simply cheaper to price in the deaths of thousands of crew than to sail safely. There\u2019s a school of thought that the market will make P&amp;O suffer for its bad behaviour, that customers will be appalled and not use them. It\u2019s true that the market does regulate the market, but it does so through catastrophe. It took the death of 80, many of them children, in a rail crash in Armagh in 1889 to make the case that train companies should be legally obliged to have brakes on carriages. In the 1870s, The Daily Telegraph revealed that one train guard had been found asleep on the job towards the end of a 40-hour shift. The company had instructed the porter to nudge him awake whenever he dropped off. We are immediately angered by the casual sacking of British crews but we need to remember that the point of sacking them is to replace them with Filipino crews who can also be treated \u2013 like that guard \u2013 as components. We\u2019ve allowed a narrative to take hold in which regulation is seen as the enemy of the individual. Indeed, we\u2019ve elected a prime minister who made his name as a kind of anti-regulation Roy Chubby Brown. But historically, regulation is how we have established the importance of the human in the face of the machine. It\u2019s how we care for each other. It\u2019s always a fight. My friend, Michael Molloy, died in his teens when the coach he was travelling on crashed. The coach\u2019s tyres turned out to be older than he was. When his mother fought for regulation, the bill she campaigned for was thrown out by Chris Heaton-Harris, the current chief whip. P&amp;O is the logical outcome of the assault on the rules-based world that we tried to build after the war. It\u2019s a campaign for disconnection. Clooney\u2019s character in Up in the Air finds that he has somehow exchanged his own ability to make relationships for a pocket full of air miles. He wanders the world like an oligarch\u2019s super-yacht \u2013 always voyaging, never docking, in perpetual and pointless motion. All at sea. At our best we hunger for connection \u2013 it\u2019s why we wanted those ferries to take that warm clothing to Ukraine. Shortly after he was elected pope, Francis went to see the refugees in Lampedusa and talked about Lope de Vega\u2019s play Fuenteovejuna, in which an entire town gets rid of a tyrant of a governor by murdering him. All the inhabitants are complicit so none of them has to take responsibility. The former Peninsular and Oriental Steam Packet Company is now owned by DP World \u2013 a \u201clogistics solutions\u201d organisation based in Dubai. Its power is rootless, mobile. The management of P&amp;O distanced themselves with tech, as though they were mere functions of their own software. Components. The chains that Truss and Raab and Patel are trying to cut are the chains that bind us to each other. The chains that tell us that we too are involved in catastrophes like Ukraine or the drownings in the Mediterranean. Cut those chains and we are all diminished.

      "body": "<p>The first time I heard about Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s case in 2016, I was in my living room with Richard Ratcliffe and Jeremy Corbyn while breastfeeding my newborn. Aside from feeling utterly sorry for this softly spoken accountant, a constituent of mine, I remember being apprehensive about Richard\u2019s determined plans to go public about his family\u2019s plight.</p> <p>In his typically calm manner, he told me the Foreign Office (FCDO) had strongly advised him to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/mar/17/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-publicity-silence-no-formula-for-success\" title=\"\">stay quiet</a>, as had lawyers he had consulted. Yet he was dismayed the FCDO hadn\u2019t been able to locate or even communicate with Nazanin in 30 days. The officials simply seemed pleased that Iran wasn\u2019t denying her existence, he told me in disbelief.</p> <p>As a legislator, I felt conflicted. Were we putting Nazanin\u2019s life in danger by going public, I asked him tentatively. He said he had put a great deal of thought into it, and that he believed going public would keep his wife safe. I decided to take my cue from Richard and offer support for his campaign, as his MP. It was important to give Nazanin a voice, for her story to be heard. Within three days of going public, Nazanin was allowed a visit from her family, and soon afterwards was transferred out of solitary confinement. We had to recognise these small victories, even though they weren\u2019t enough.</p> <p>Over time, I became bolder in my view that going public was the right approach, but not all parliamentarians agreed. One FCDO minister told me that every time I mentioned Nazanin in parliament I added five years to her prison sentence. Given I was granted eight urgent questions and countless debates in parliament about her, that was an alarming thought. Thank goodness, the maths didn\u2019t add up.</p> <p>I also got into hot water when <a href=\"https://www.hamhigh.co.uk/news/tulip-siddiq-highlights-torture-of-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-in-iranian-3548034\" title=\"\">telling the press</a> that Nazanin\u2019s treatment in prison fitted the UN\u2019s criteria for torture \u2013 another FCDO minister tracked down my personal phone number in order to berate me. But soon afterwards, Nazanin was finally allowed a medical examination. When speaking to her months later, while under house arrest, she thanked me and said the campaign meant she was the best-protected inmate in Evin prison.</p> <p>As the years went by, the link between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/nov/11/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-iran-uk-debt-arms-deal\" title=\"\">Britain\u2019s historic debt of \u00a3400m</a> for a cancelled arms deal with Iran and Nazanin\u2019s imprisonment became a growing source of tension. Along with Labour\u2019s then shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, I repeatedly raised concerns over state hostage-taking and Iran\u2019s clear pattern of behaviour in this area. Nazanin was repeatedly told by her captors that her arrest was linked to the debt, while the then Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, cited it in an interview at the United Nations General Assembly in 2019.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>While we are overjoyed at the outcome, it\u2019s impossible not to regret all the time that was wasted</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite this, all three prime ministers and the four foreign secretaries that I dealt with refused to acknowledge the link, beyond off-record briefings to journalists. They were not alone. In March 2021, I asked Jacob Rees-Mogg, then leader of the House of Commons, whether he would agree there was a clear link between Nazanin\u2019s case and the debt. In a call to the prime minister the day before, the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, had all but confirmed that resolving this debt was the key to diplomatic progress and could help Nazanin\u2019s case. Rees-Mogg replied: \u201cIt would be quite wrong to link payments of any money to the release of somebody who is improperly detained.\u201d The message seemed clear: this government would not acknowledge the link.</p> <p>A breakthrough came towards the end of 2021 when we met Liz Truss (our fifth foreign secretary).

      "bodyText": "The first time I heard about Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s case in 2016, I was in my living room with Richard Ratcliffe and Jeremy Corbyn while breastfeeding my newborn. Aside from feeling utterly sorry for this softly spoken accountant, a constituent of mine, I remember being apprehensive about Richard\u2019s determined plans to go public about his family\u2019s plight. In his typically calm manner, he told me the Foreign Office (FCDO) had strongly advised him to stay quiet, as had lawyers he had consulted. Yet he was dismayed the FCDO hadn\u2019t been able to locate or even communicate with Nazanin in 30 days. The officials simply seemed pleased that Iran wasn\u2019t denying her existence, he told me in disbelief. As a legislator, I felt conflicted. Were we putting Nazanin\u2019s life in danger by going public, I asked him tentatively. He said he had put a great deal of thought into it, and that he believed going public would keep his wife safe. I decided to take my cue from Richard and offer support for his campaign, as his MP. It was important to give Nazanin a voice, for her story to be heard. Within three days of going public, Nazanin was allowed a visit from her family, and soon afterwards was transferred out of solitary confinement. We had to recognise these small victories, even though they weren\u2019t enough. Over time, I became bolder in my view that going public was the right approach, but not all parliamentarians agreed. One FCDO minister told me that every time I mentioned Nazanin in parliament I added five years to her prison sentence. Given I was granted eight urgent questions and countless debates in parliament about her, that was an alarming thought. Thank goodness, the maths didn\u2019t add up. I also got into hot water when telling the press that Nazanin\u2019s treatment in prison fitted the UN\u2019s criteria for torture \u2013 another FCDO minister tracked down my personal phone number in order to berate me. But soon afterwards, Nazanin was finally allowed a medical examination. When speaking to her months later, while under house arrest, she thanked me and said the campaign meant she was the best-protected inmate in Evin prison. As the years went by, the link between Britain\u2019s historic debt of \u00a3400m for a cancelled arms deal with Iran and Nazanin\u2019s imprisonment became a growing source of tension. Along with Labour\u2019s then shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, I repeatedly raised concerns over state hostage-taking and Iran\u2019s clear pattern of behaviour in this area. Nazanin was repeatedly told by her captors that her arrest was linked to the debt, while the then Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, cited it in an interview at the United Nations General Assembly in 2019. Despite this, all three prime ministers and the four foreign secretaries that I dealt with refused to acknowledge the link, beyond off-record briefings to journalists. They were not alone. In March 2021, I asked Jacob Rees-Mogg, then leader of the House of Commons, whether he would agree there was a clear link between Nazanin\u2019s case and the debt. In a call to the prime minister the day before, the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, had all but confirmed that resolving this debt was the key to diplomatic progress and could help Nazanin\u2019s case. Rees-Mogg replied: \u201cIt would be quite wrong to link payments of any money to the release of somebody who is improperly detained.\u201d The message seemed clear: this government would not acknowledge the link. A breakthrough came towards the end of 2021 when we met Liz Truss (our fifth foreign secretary). For the first time, an elected government official seemed to explicitly acknowledge the link, and she has since described the debt as \u201clegitimate\u201d. Richard and I have, in recent days, found ourselves laughing in sheer disbelief at how the narrative has changed, with the entire government now openly celebrating how it paid the debt to get Nazanin back. While we are overjoyed at the outcome, it\u2019s impossible not to regret all the time that was wasted. I also cannot reflect on Nazanin\u2019s story without lamenting the prime minister\u2019s damaging role in it. In 2017, Boris Johnson, then foreign secretary, wrongly told the foreign affairs select committee that Nazanin had been in Iran \u201csimply teaching people journalism, as I understand it\u201d. His remarks were weaponised in the Iranian state media and cited by the Iranian judiciary as evidence for her \u201ccrimes\u201d. This disastrous blunder meant Johnson was forced to meet us. Again, I raised my concerns about the debt, which were flatly denied by him. Incredibly, he asked if Richard had enjoyed his visit to Iran. Anyone who had read a newspaper article on the case was aware that Richard had been at home in the UK when his wife was arrested in Iran.

The emotional reunion early on Thursday with her husband, Richard, and seven-year-old daughter Gabriella came after Britain agreed to pay a debt of \u00a3393.8m to Iran relating to an order for Chieftain tanks. Johnson described Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s return, alongside that of retired British-Iranian civil engineer Anoosheh Ashoori, as the result of a \u201cgreat deal of UK diplomacy\u201d.

Consumer gas prices usually move in tandem with oil prices but this week, when oil prices fell below $100 a barrel as China\u2019s Covid-19 outbreak threatened demand, there was little relief for at the pump. Democrats accuse giant oil corporations, already raking in billions of dollars, of profiteering.</p> <p>Biden wrote in a tweet: \u201cOil prices are decreasing, gas prices should too. Last time oil was $96 a barrel, gas was $3.62 a gallon. Now it\u2019s $4.31. Oil and gas companies shouldn\u2019t pad their profits at the expense of hardworking Americans.\u201d</p> <p>Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, and Frank Pallone, chair of the House of Representatives\u2019 energy and commerce committee, requested that oil company chief executives testify before Congress on 6 April. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1504116892868489221?s=20&amp;t=x46lYnDzonAiiFA8zX6V2w\">Schumer said on the Senate floor</a>: \u201cThe bewildering incongruity between falling oil prices and rising gas prices smacks of price gouging.\u201d</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, <a href=\"https://www.markey.senate.gov/\">Ed Markey</a>, a Democratic senator for Massachusetts, pointed out that oil companies already have all the land they need to heed Republicans\u2019 plea to \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d \u2013 but will not do it because it is contrary to their business model.</p> <p>\u201cChevron, Exxon, BP, Shell \u2013 they made a combined $75bn in net profits last year and, despite all their crocodile tears right now about this crisis, they\u2019ve already announced that they\u2019re going to return $38bn to their shareholders instead of taking the $38bn and beginning to drill on the 12,000 leases that they have on federal land in the United States for oil and gas,\u201d Markey said.</p> <p>\u201cThe reason they\u2019re not going to do it is that they are hypocrites, they are liars.

Jamie Lee Curtis enthused: \u201cThis is a marvel of a movie\u2026 a deep look inside self-love and what drives us.\u201d But, for all that Barack Obama listed the film among his favourites of 2021, it might all have seemed a little too wafty, a little too hung up on male handwringing, were it not for the transfixing central performance of Renate Reinsve.</p> <p>Previously unknown beyond Norway, the 34-year-old actor has captured the zeitgeist just as surely as the lovers in Sally Rooney\u2019s <em>Normal People</em>, winning the best actress award in the film\u2019s first outing to last summer\u2019s Cannes film festival. \u201cThere is energy, there is something extraordinary, vivacious in her performance.

In 12 \u201cchapters\u201d, bookended by a prologue and an epilogue, the film interrogates such millennial issues as: \u201cCan you be a feminist and still enjoy oral sex?\u201d At its heart is Julie\u2019s push-pull relationship with a comic-book artist, Aksel (Anders Danielsen Lie), whose very different perspective on life is shaped by the fact that he is 15 years older than her. He has made his name with underground comics she finds sexist; he wants to have children, but his attempt to integrate her with his social circle gives her a glimpse of family life that appals her.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Carpentry is the opposite of acting\u2026 you have to be creative, but you have to make it structurally sound</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Does Reinsve herself identify with that experience?

In the film\u2019s most talked about scene, time is frozen for everyone but Julia, who tears across Oslo to declare her love for Eivind (Herbert Nordrum). The scene was shot in real time, with extras brought in to stand still in the streets while the traffic was temporarily stopped, capturing the heart-stopping power of an infatuation that suspends reality. It\u2019s so reckless that you know it won\u2019t end well. \u201cWhen she makes a choice, it\u2019s a shitty choice a lot of the time \u2013 and that\u2019s very true,\u201d says Reinsve. \u201cI feel I\u2019ve made so many bad choices in my life. I really connect to that way of being. I\u2019ve broken up with people who could have been really great for me, or gone into relationships that were really bad for me. And you don\u2019t know the consequence of your choices before you\u2019ve lived that choice. So it\u2019s impossible to make a good choice, isn\u2019t it? c and try to be happy with what you have.\u201d</p> <p>One look at Reinsve\u2019s biography makes it clear that she is very far from the sum of her bad choices. Growing up in a tiny settlement \u2013 \u201ca really, really small place, just like a road with some houses and farmlands all around\u201d \u2013 she spent much of her early childhood hanging around the hardware store her grandfather had founded, which employed most of her family. When I ask how many siblings she has, she goes quiet for an unusually long time, before finally deciding that the answer is three. Why the hesitation? \u201cBecause there are a lot of step-sisters also. We\u2019ve been a lot of girls, but three are my sisters.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People project their own perspective on to the film\u2026 It\u2019s like a big conversation with so many people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At school she became a competition swimmer. \u201cI did it, like, five times a week, with competitions once or twice a week. So it was quite a lot.\u201d But though she was always busy, and surrounded by people, she was clear by her mid-teens that it wasn\u2019t what she wanted, so at 17 she absconded to Edinburgh. \u201cI had a lot of good things, but I also had a lot of bad things. I was quite sad and angry. So I ran away and tried to grow up by myself,\u201d she says, adding that she\u2019d originally intended to go to Costa Rica because it was warm, but she didn\u2019t have any money, and discovered she could fly to the Scottish capital for \u00a31. \u201cCrazy, yeah? Not good. They can\u2019t have treated their employees very well.\u201d</p> <p>In Edinburgh she worked in a bar and \u201cpartied a lot with my new friends\u201d. She also got involved with the Fringe, and discovered her vocation. After two years she moved to Oslo \u201cto, like, actually<em> be</em> an actress. I took all the classes, went to acting school. I love books, but I threw them all away except for scripts and books on acting, just to focus. I was very sure about it,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She was in her early 20s when Trier gave her a single line in his 2011 film, <em>Oslo, August 31st</em>, the second part of a loose trilogy set in the Norwegian capital that culminates with <em>The Worst Person in the World</em>. \u201cI was an extended extra,\u201d she says. \u201cI said: \u2018Let\u2019s go to the party\u2019, and tried to bring people to the next location, that was my one task. But Joachim said he liked my energy, so even though I only had one line, I was there for nine days.\u201d Over the years, they became friends; \u201cnot close\u201d, she says, \u201cbut we always ended up talking about really deep existential stuff, because we\u2019re both interested in putting everything in different perspectives. We talked at a deeper level than I\u2019m used to with my friends.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2516114c4b492a4e801c6387834685a203afd3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2516114c4b492a4e801c6387834685a203afd3d/102_0_1413_848/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reinsve in 2017 short Sweet Things.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reinsve in 2017 short Sweet Things.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @folkefienderfilm</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For all that, his phone call offering the part of Julie was a complete surprise. Can it really be true that she had decided the previous day to make a career change? Indeed it is, she insists. \u201cI wanted to be a carpenter, because I really enjoy it. I\u2019m not good at it, but I just wanted to do something completely different and something calm. But I also had a big vision of making a group for women to learn to fix things and build stuff together.\u201d</p> <p>The story of how she got to that point offers a clue to why she is not Julie, but has managed to turn Julie-like choices, which might have been disastrous, to her advantage. She had recently bought a house, she says. \u201cI bought it because I was very naive, and it was rotten, so I had to fix the whole house. I learned so much, and I found it really empowering and meditative to build. It\u2019s so concrete. It\u2019s the opposite of acting, in many ways. You have to be creative, but you have to know what you\u2019re doing as well. You have to make it structurally sound, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>That carpentry plan is now on indefinite hold, while she rides the wave of her new stardom: \u201cRight now, I have no time at all.\u201d She\u2019s trying to plan her next moves, while dealing with an apparently insatiable public interest. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know how to do it. I say weird things and do weird stuff, and act like a normal person.\u201d In Oslo she is constantly being stopped in the streets. \u201cWhenever I go out, someone always comes up to me. People project their own life and their own perspective on to the film, and that\u2019s what you want when you make a movie: to share it and have the experience together with someone. We asked questions when we made this movie, and I feel we didn\u2019t give any answers. It\u2019s like a big conversation with so many people.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_cV1q02cyE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w_cV1q02cyE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_cV1q02cyE\">Watch a trailer for The Worst Person in the World.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>One of the more painful conversations arises late on in the film, when Aksel is demolished on television for the sexism of cartoons he created years earlier. An estranged Julie looks on in appalled sympathy, after catching the interview by accident on an overhead screen. It\u2019s yet another scene that arouses curiosity about Reinsve herself: \u201cWell, you\u2019re not having that conversation to solve anything,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember when #MeToo came to Norway, and this happened. I just pulled out of the whole movement, because I felt the women were so aggressive. I really felt that\u2019s the wrong way to do it, because we need men also. They, of course, feel really, really bad and vulnerable for having had these views that were imposed on them [by society]. They aren\u2019t just bad people who were born like that. So it\u2019s really, really complicated. To solve it together, and talk about it, is the most important thing.\u201d</p> <p>Though she\u2019s getting used to being a spokeswoman for such controversial issues, which is way above the pay grade of the average first-time star, she\u2019s considering signing up for therapy once the press tour is over, she says. She\u2019s not being entirely frivolous. \u201cIn interviews, you talk so much about yourself and I\u2019m used to having two-way conversations. I\u2019m going to see the therapist and I\u2019m going to say: \u2018OK, hello. It\u2019s been a year.

      "bodyText": "What does it mean to be an adult woman today? Is it an age or a stage? Parenthood, a steady partner, a career or a home of one\u2019s own? Julie, the central character in The Worst Person in the World, shimmies through her 20s to arrive at her 30th birthday with none of these. She\u2019s unmoored, restless, fancy-free \u2013 a romantic adventurer and the charismatic subject of a story that is traditionally told about men. As Julie herself puts it, lobbing a grenade into a cosy gathering of her older lover\u2019s friends: \u201cI feel like I know everything about male problems. It\u2019s in all the books and movies. Where\u2019s the menstrual period, orgasm and desire?\u201d They\u2019re all here, in an existential comedy of metropolitan twentysomething life from the Norwegian director Joachim Trier that has had Hollywood royalty queuing up to pay homage. \u201cIt\u2019s so brilliant and it wrecked me.

Previously unknown beyond Norway, the 34-year-old actor has captured the zeitgeist just as surely as the lovers in Sally Rooney\u2019s Normal People, winning the best actress award in the film\u2019s first outing to last summer\u2019s Cannes film festival. \u201cThere is energy, there is something extraordinary, vivacious in her performance. Something alive that you just can\u2019t define, but you can feel it,\u201d said Isabelle Huppert at the time.

It\u2019s yet another scene that arouses curiosity about Reinsve herself: \u201cWell, you\u2019re not having that conversation to solve anything,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember when #MeToo came to Norway, and this happened. I just pulled out of the whole movement, because I felt the women were so aggressive. I really felt that\u2019s the wrong way to do it, because we need men also. They, of course, feel really, really bad and vulnerable for having had these views that were imposed on them [by society]. They aren\u2019t just bad people who were born like that. So it\u2019s really, really complicated. To solve it together, and talk about it, is the most important thing.\u201d Though she\u2019s getting used to being a spokeswoman for such controversial issues, which is way above the pay grade of the average first-time star, she\u2019s considering signing up for therapy once the press tour is over, she says. She\u2019s not being entirely frivolous. \u201cIn interviews, you talk so much about yourself and I\u2019m used to having two-way conversations. I\u2019m going to see the therapist and I\u2019m going to say: \u2018OK, hello. It\u2019s been a year. Just how fucked up am I?\u2019\u201d The Worst Person in the World is released in cinemas on 25 March",

      "body": "<p>Halfway through this subtle, sophisticated attempt to diagnose the state of the nation, Jason Cowley is given a tour of the East London Mosque in Whitechapel \u2013 the largest and oldest in Britain. He is there to talk to Imam Mohammed Mahmoud, who became famous for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/19/finsbury-park-van-attack-why-imam-mohammed-mahmoud-saved-terror-suspect\">calm wisdom during the Finsbury Park mosque attack</a>, when he protected a white terrorist from an angry crowd of worshippers. But he also meets Sufia Alam, manager of the Maryam centre at the mosque, where Muslim women can gather and pray. A British Bangladeshi, Alam takes her leave of Cowley with a friendly but pointed reference to the legacy of empire, delivered in a strong east London accent: \u201cWe are here because you were there. You will have to learn to live with us \u2013 because we aren\u2019t going anywhere. England is our home.\u201d</p> <p>But what is England? The complex, ever-changing nature of our shared national home is the central theme of <em>Who Are We Now?</em> This is a book that Cowley began to write at the height of the political polarisation that followed the Brexit referendum, and completed as the country emerged from the Covid pandemic. It is, in part, a reflection on what these crises have taught us, for better and for worse. But it is also a book about home: specifically, what might a \u201ccommon home\u201d look like in the future for the citizens of a diverse and at times bitterly divided country?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018England\u2019 \u2013 its fate, meaning and possibilities \u2013 is one of the most neuralgic subjects of all for progressives</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>During his long editorship of the left-leaning <em>New Statesman</em> magazine, Cowley has shown a notable willingness to showcase an eclectic range of views that challenge the current liberal consensus in Labour and beyond.

But it is one that clearly frames and informs Cowley\u2019s political preoccupations, as well as his football passions.</p> <p>Through a series of individual tales compellingly told, he revisits some of the significant news stories that have made headlines in modern England. Shire patriotism, British Muslim identity, post-industrial decline and the dark, ruthless underbelly to the global economy are all explored. One chapter deals with the moving \u201cliturgy of repatriation\u201d that developed in Wootton Bassett, as the bodies of British soldiers were brought back from Iraq and Afghanistan in the 00s, but which then attracted the thuggish attention of the English Defence League. Mahmoud remembers his fear of the anti-Muslim backlash that would follow if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/02/finsbury-park-attack-darren-osborne-jailed\">Darren Osborne</a>, a white supremacist alcoholic, was beaten to death.

Cowley recalls Brown telling him during that doomed campaign that he was consoled by a belief that David Cameron\u2019s Conservatives represented a form of continuity with New Labour\u2019s economic and social liberalism. Looking back, Cowley writes, \u201cMrs Duffy knew something Gordon Brown did not. She was troubled by\u2026 weakening social cohesion. She knew that many other longtime Labour voters shared her unease and sense of loss.\u201d England\u2019s political landscape, and the Labour party\u2019s place within it, was about to be transformed.</p> <p>On Cowley goes, through events that were pivotal and are familiar, but are rarely juxtaposed with each other as evidence of who we are now. The Black Lives Matter protests of 2020 are viewed through the acute lens of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/06/patrick-hutchinson-black-lives-matter-protest-london-faces-2020\">Patrick Hutchinson</a>, whose firefighter\u2019s lift to rescue a shaven-headed Tommy Robinson supporter from a beating became the most famous image of that summer. \u201cThey think they\u2019re defending Englishness,\u201d says Hutchinson. \u201cThey think they\u2019re the last line of defence.\u201d Is that kind of recidivist, insular, punching Englishness, wonders Cowley, the inevitable default setting for a concept that will never escape the shadow of the imperial past? Many progressives would simply say yes. He pushes back somewhat, celebrating the emerging, \u201cinchoate\u201d England captured by Gareth Southgate before the Euro 2020 football tournament. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/11/gareth-southgate-englishness-england-manager-letter-diverse\">Southgate\u2019s letter to England</a> ranged from his grandfather\u2019s war record to the social activism of his young black players.

But could Southgate\u2019s \u201cprogressive patriotism\u201d really catch on, or was it merely \u201ca haunting glimpse of what might have been in a country without our burden of traditionalism and lack of republican and modernist credentials?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This book is a kind of pilgrimage of return to the place that formed him</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is a gentle and intelligent book, refreshingly unpolemical and reflective.

Moving to Harlow in the postwar years, like the rest of the Cowley family, Connie embodied the \u201cnever again\u201d hope and idealism of the Labour new town. Social solidarity forged in war was to make a new peace in which working-class people could live well. In the words of Lord Reith, it would be \u201ca happy and gracious way of life\u201d. In 1961, Connie enthusiastically paid a local tax to finance a sports centre for the town. \u201cWe were children of the welfare state,\u201d writes Cowley of himself and his friends.

Technically, it was me.\u201d</p> <p>Adopted by a couple who renamed her Elizabeth, Harvie always knew she had come from \u201canother lady\u2019s tummy\u201d and wondered why she had been given away. But, as she would later discover, she had not been abandoned by choice.</p> <p>Taken from the arms of her sobbing mother at 10 days old, Harvie was one of thousands of victims of forced adoption in the UK.</p> <p>In the 1950s, 60s and 70s, up to a 250,000 new mothers were coerced into giving up their babies in arrangements <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/03/christian-churches-forced-adoptions-in-the-uk-did-you-lose-your-child\" title=\"\">facilitated by the church</a>, charities and the government.

      "bodyText": "Liz Harvie was 16 years old when she discovered her name was actually Claire Watts. Sitting on the sofa of her childhood home, on a tree-lined street in a Birmingham suburb, she had just been given a sheet of paper containing the first chapter of her life. The document said \u201cClaire\u201d, a \u201ccompact baby\u201d with a \u201cpale complexion\u201d and \u201clight auburn hair\u201d, had been born at a Northampton hospital in January 1974 and then put up for adoption. It also included descriptions of her birth parents: Yvonne, a \u201cneat\u201d, \u201carticulate\u201d and \u201cquite attractive\u201d telephonist who liked swimming, reading and knitting, and Andrew, a \u201cwell-built\u201d wireless operator who liked rugby and tropical fish. \u201cIt was mind-blowing,\u201d said Harvie, now 48. \u201cI was reading about a different person born in a different part of the country. Technically, it was me.\u201d Adopted by a couple who renamed her Elizabeth, Harvie always knew she had come from \u201canother lady\u2019s tummy\u201d and wondered why she had been given away. But, as she would later discover, she had not been abandoned by choice. Taken from the arms of her sobbing mother at 10 days old, Harvie was one of thousands of victims of forced adoption in the UK. In the 1950s, 60s and 70s, up to a 250,000 new mothers were coerced into giving up their babies in arrangements facilitated by the church, charities and the government. The young unmarried women were not considered \u201csuitable\u201d parents by society or their families, and their babies were given to married couples who were. The scandal of forced adoption reached into every corner of the UK, but the stories of the families torn apart have largely gone untold. Last week in parliament, Harvie, who first met her birth mother when she was 28, gave evidence on behalf of thousands of other adoptees to the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which is investigating the historical abuses. The hospice volunteer from Surrey described how groups \u201ccolluded\u201d to remove children from unmarried mothers and called for an apology. \u201cFor many involved in forced adoption the right to family life was simply not honoured,\u201d she told MPs. Speaking after the session on Wednesday, Harvie, now a mother of two herself, said giving evidence was one of \u201cthe most important days\u201d of her life. \u201cTo get the chance to stand up in parliament and give evidence was humongous. For too long, it\u2019s been like we\u2019re part of a secret society.\u201d Brought up by a finance director and magistrate in a typical middle-class home, Harvie had for years been the \u201cperfect\u201d adoptee. Privately, however, she struggled. At school, she was called a \u201cbastard\u201d by playground bullies and taunted about her mum not being her \u201creal mum\u201d. At home, she had a close relationship with her brother, who was also adopted \u2013 but felt she didn\u2019t fit in. \u201cI stuffed things down and appeared to be \u2018happy Liz\u2019. But you feel like a stranger in your own skin, in your own family,\u201d she said. Sixty miles away in Northampton, her birth mother, Yvonne Labrum, was living in torment, thinking about her daughter \u201cevery single day\u201d. Labrum had always dreamed of having a daughter but when she got pregnant at 19, her father \u201cwent mad\u201d. The child\u2019s father, Andrew Conant was a childhood sweetheart but they were not married, and their parents disapproved of the match. \u201cMy father said, \u2018Right, you\u2019re going to the doctors and having an abortion,\u201d Labrum, now 68, said. \u201cThe doctor said it was too late, so he said, \u2018Right, the baby\u2019s going up for adoption, then.\u2019 I never got a say in the matter.\u201d Moments after giving birth, Labrum\u2019s daughter was taken from her by the midwives. At first, they had congratulated her on her \u201cbeautiful baby girl\u201d. But after checking her file, \u201cOne of the nurses said, \u2018This baby\u2019s flagged for adoption,\u2019 and that was it.\u201d Labrum, who had given birth without pain relief and needed stitches, was left lying with her legs in stirrups for more than an hour. \u201cI felt like a slab of meat,\u201d she said. Over the next few days, she was required to look after her daughter at the hospital, surrounded by mothers who were preparing to take their newborns home. On the 10th day, a \u201cstern\u201d social worker visited to take Claire away. Labrum packed a bag for her daughter before putting her arms out to give her a final cuddle. But the social worker refused to pass her back. \u201cI was standing there in floods of tears,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like having your heart ripped out of your chest.\u201d In the months that followed, she became \u201cvery withdrawn\u201d. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do anything. All I kept thinking was, \u2018Where\u2019s my baby?\u2019\u201d She later married and pursued her career - but she never forgot about Claire. It was not until 1995 that the mother and daughter reconnected, after they had both registered their details with the Children\u2019s Society, the organisation that had arranged the adoption. They exchanged letters and pictures for seven years before agreeing to meet in person. They were desperate to see each other in real life but Harvie was \u201cfrightened\u201d. \u201cYou have to be ready for something like that,\u201d she said. When they did eventually meet in 2002, at a hotel in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, they \u201ccried and hugged and didn\u2019t want to let go\u201d, she said. They have since made up for lost time, learning each other\u2019s life stories. They have lots in common: small hands, the same eyes, a silly sense of humour.

They also called for specialist support for victims of the scandal, who have so far received none, and easier access to counselling services for adult adoptees. Other countries where forced adoption took place, including Canada and Australia, have already apologised. For Labrum, an official apology would mean the recognition that the adoptions \u201cshouldn\u2019t have happened\u201d, and that she \u2013 as a young, unmarried mother \u2013 was not to blame. \u201cIt won\u2019t repair all the harm, but it would help,\u201d she said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t naughty girls who did something wrong.

His UK Joint Expeditionary Force carries an unfortunate whiff of Dunkirk. Doing America\u2019s bidding, Boris Johnson went cap in hand to Saudi Arabia last week in search of cheap oil and was ritually humiliated by another mass murderer. Far from holding the ring, Britain, as matters stand, will not even be in the room this week when Europe ponders its biggest security and refugee crisis since 1945. Who\u2019d have thought Brexit could make the plight of Ukrainians any worse? But it has.",

But we also have a program and agenda that speaks to the long-term interests of our state. </p> <p>They wouldn\u2019t have been, I think it is fair to say, too many people casting their ballots yesterday top of mind thinking about three-year-old preschool, but I can assure you it is top of my mind because that is the sort of reform that sets up our state for the future. That is the sort of reform that will start to see a long-term dividend that we will not see the benefit of the 20 or even 30 years, but I want to be party to a government that inks about the long-term. </p> <p>If South Australian is decided one thing above all else last night it is that they don\u2019t want a government just thinking about the next four years. They want to government thinking about the next generation. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-03-19T23:41:41.228Z\">at 11.41pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6236685b8f0832c62ade1eff\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-03-19T23:34:04.615Z\">11.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Looks like we will be hearing from the prime minister at 12pm AEDT. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/political_alert/status/1505325705445347330\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Prime Minister will hold a press conference at 12pm, Kirribilli NSW <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/auspol?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#auspol</a></p>&mdash; Political Alert (@political_alert) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/political_alert/status/1505325705445347330?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 19, 2022</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-623667f18f0832c62ade1efc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-03-19T23:33:02.685Z\">11.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Malinauskas says winning the SA state election was a \u201chumbling\u201d experience. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So, look, obviously last night was a significant electoral outcome.

The economic confidence he delivered to South Australia, the ongoing growth in what will be higher-paying, more highly skilled [workers] in SA for many years to come, the transformation of schooling SA, investments in hospitals, these will be positives which he will be marked up for but clearly a disappointing day for the Liberal family in SA to have that result. </p> <p>The campaign was one in which we saw the Labor party run a very targeted, very singularly focused campaign around hospitals and ambulances. <strong>I</strong><strong> think there were many misleading aspects to that campaign and even the Electoral Commission found so in the last day or so,</strong> but that again is a reminder to all of us that we can\u2019t underscore the potential for Labor to run these types of scare campaigns just like they did with mediscare back in 2016, particularly when they can roll out the public sector unions to devastating effects.</p> </blockquote> <p>Insiders host <strong>David Speers</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So is that your take on this election result, the electorate was tricked?</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Birmingham</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No, not entirely. I do think that Labor\u2019s campaign was effective, but I also think, as the Electoral Commission found, that it was based on misleading statements and that of course is something that does mean that some voters potentially were tricked but equally I think Covid did play a very difficult role for Steven Marshall. </p> <p>When he opened the borders from SA to the rest of the country on 23 November, it was 24 November, the very day after that Omicron was first reported to the World Health Organization as a variant of concern. You couldn\u2019t have had perhaps more unlucky timing than Steven Marshall faced in that regard and that the carefully calibrated plans he had for reopening were clearly blown out of the water at that time and that did create real challenges for the Government through the run-up and lead-up to the election, and, of course, in terms of what the narrative of their campaign was.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-03-19T23:44:18.104Z\">at 11.44pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-623656d68f081efd3276fbda\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-03-19T22:19:07.133Z\">10.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/patty_mitchell/status/1505286797944713216\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The hearse carrying Shane Warne\u2019s coffin has arrived at Moorabbin ahead of today\u2019s private funeral. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/9NewsMelb?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@9NewsMelb</a>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheTodayShow?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@TheTodayShow</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/3AW693?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@3AW693</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/vbqg84N7kz\">pic.twitter.com/vbqg84N7kz</a></p>&mdash; Pat Mitchell (@patty_mitchell) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/patty_mitchell/status/1505286797944713216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 19, 2022</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-623655b98f08ee17b5372e28\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-03-19T22:14:37.508Z\">10.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">NSW records four Covid deaths and 16,813 new infections</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NSWHealth/status/1505303592798158849\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">COVID-19 update \u2013 Sunday 20 March 2022<br><br>In the 24-hour reporting period to 4pm yesterday: <br><br>- 96% of people aged 16+ have had one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine<br>- 94.5% of people aged 16+ have had two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine <a href=\"https://t.co/AgpIm0Sejv\">pic.twitter.com/AgpIm0Sejv</a></p>&mdash; NSW Health (@NSWHealth) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NSWHealth/status/1505303592798158849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 19, 2022</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6236556c8f08ee17b5372e26\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-03-19T22:14:10.397Z\">10.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Victoria records 6,694 new Covid cases and zero deaths</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I believe this may be the first day in many months that Victoria has recorded no Covid-19 deaths.<br></p> <p>Apologies, I previously stated that the state recorded 16,965 cases - this was the number of PRC tests that were conducted yesterday.

Before we go, a quick recap on what has been a busy Sunday: Foreign minister Marise Payne described Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine as \u201cwar crimes\u201d as the government announced a major aid and assistance package for Ukraine, including more money for refugee support and a new humanitarian visa for Ukrainian refugees. The government announced more money for defence support and banned aluminium ore and alumina exports to Russia. The ousted SA premier Steven Marshall resigned as leader of the Liberal party following Labor\u2019s comprehensive win in the state. He remains in a battle to keep his seat. Shane Warne\u2019s family and friends farewelled him at a private funeral in Melbourne, with about 80 guests gathering to say their goodbyes to the cricketing great. Thanks for sticking with me. See you next time. Still on the SA election, former premier Steven Marshall remains locked in a tight battle to retain his own seat. ABC election analyst Anthony Green says Labor\u2019s Cressida O\u2019Hanlon is now ahead of Marshall in the seat of Dunstan. The addition of ticket votes have given her a slight edge - 50.5% to 49.5%. There are still more pre-polls and postal votes to be counted. Marshal has already resigned as Liberal leader following his party\u2019s comprehensive loss to Labor. While resigning, Marshall said: I also look forward to continuing to serve the people of Dunstan. He may not have that chance. Rio Tinto has issued a statement following the government\u2019s announcement it was banning alumina and aluminium ore exports to Russia due to its invasion of Ukraine. Rio Tinto jointly owns Queensland Alumina Limited with Rusal, the Russian aluminium giant. A spokesman told the Guardian: Rio Tinto notes the government\u2019s announcement today regarding export sanctions. As announced on 10 March 2022, Rio Tinto is in the process of terminating all commercial relationships it has with any Russian business. Our priority remains the wellbeing of our people, our communities and the continued safe operation of our businesses, in full compliance with all governmental directions, including the Queensland Alumina Limited joint venture. With that, I shall hand you over to the amazing Christopher Knaus who will take you through the rest of the evening of news. See you tomorrow! The South Australian election result should have Scott Morrison\u2019s Coalition \u201ctrembling\u201d ahead of the federal poll, Labor says, after Peter Malinauskas became the first opposition leader to defeat an incumbent government since the start of the pandemic. The outgoing premier, Steven Marshall, announced on Sunday he would step down as Liberal leader after the landslide loss to Labor, saying he \u201ctakes full responsibility for the result\u201d and accepts \u201cthe will of the people\u201d. The prime minister sought to downplay what the resounding Labor win in South Australia could mean on a federal level, saying Anthony Albanese doesn\u2019t match up to his state colleagues. You can read the full report below: Incoming South Australian premier Peter Malinauskas says his new Labor government will continue to back the health advice in dealing with the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, AAP reports. After several days of reasonably high, but largely stable, infection numbers, Malinauskas said he would meet soon with senior health officials and the police commissioner, Grant Stevens, on the issue. Throughout the pandemic, I backed in the health advice. That\u2019s something we were consistent on ... We intend to continue to follow the health advice but also make sure that is done in a way that is considered and tested against other variables. Malinauskas said he hoped the bipartisan approach to Covid-19 management in SA would be maintained under the new government after Labor\u2019s convincing election win on Saturday. He said he also intended to push ahead with amending the state\u2019s Emergency Management Act, the legislation used to impose restrictions and other measures including mask mandates, lockdowns and density limits. The act is not fit for purpose for a global pandemic that lasts for two years. Sydneysiders are being urged to exercise caution when returning to swim in the city\u2019s beaches and waterways after weeks of torrential rain and flooding. Sediment and debris swept downstream by heavy rain turned Sydney Harbour brown last week, with swimmers warned to avoid the water. With a few sunny days forecast to provide some respite in the coming week, how can you tell whether it\u2019s safe to return for a dip? Find out in the article below! Hundreds of \u201cunder-resourced\u201d NSW paramedics will ratchet up an industrial campaign against the state government by refusing to leave their posts to fill gaps at other ambulance stations, AAP reports. The 24-hour action on Monday means paramedics across the state will refuse \u201call staff movements\u201d at stations as part of ongoing union efforts to improve emergency responder staffing and pay. \u201cParamedics signing on tomorrow will refuse to travel from their designated station to help plug roster holes elsewhere,\u201d Australian Paramedics Association NSW president Chris Kastelan said. We\u2019re taking action to demand a better resourced service. We want a fairer workplace for Paramedics, and improved coverage and care for our communities. The union is pushing for an additional 1500 paramedics that it says are needed to turn around deteriorating ambulance response times across the state. It also wants a pandemic payment, and a pay rise of more than 2.5%. In February, paramedics took a similar 24-hour action amid claims of worsening conditions including staff doing 16-hour shifts without breaks. NSW Ambulance said an Industrial Relations Commission meeting with the union was scheduled for Monday in a bid to \u201cminimise disruption to health services\u201d. \u201cNSW Health meets regularly with unions to discuss paramedic awards and entitlements,\u201d a NSW Ambulance spokesperson told AAP. NSW Ambulance values and acknowledges the work of all paramedics and control centre staff who have worked so hard over the last two years of the Covid-19 paramedic. Health minister Brad Hazzard has been contacted for comment. Monday\u2019s action is set to commence as day shift crews clock on from 6:15am. It comes after thousands of nurses rallied outside NSW parliament last month, as well as 25 locations around the state. Shane Warne\u2019s family and friends have attended a private funeral in Melbourne, with about 80 guests gathered to say their final goodbyes to the cricketing legend, AAP reports. Warne\u2019s three children, Jackson, Brooke and Summer, and parents Keith and Brigette, along with close friends including retired Test captains Mark Taylor and Allan Border and former England skipper Michael Vaughan, were among those at the service. Close mate and television personality Eddie McGuire delivered the eulogy and was MC for the service, which was held at St Kilda Football Club. Warne, 52, died of a suspected heart attack on the Thai resort island of Koh Samui on 4 March. A state memorial will take place at the MCG on 30 March, where the wider public will be able to pay their respects to an Australian icon. The ground\u2019s Great Southern Stand will also be renamed in Warne\u2019s honour. The cricketing legend\u2019s death little more than two weeks ago led to an outpouring of grief from people around the world, as well as those closer to home. St Kilda Cricket Club coach Glenn Lalor told AAP on Saturday of his time playing with Warne in the early 2000s. Every time Shane was available he would love coming back and playing with us, which was great... The boys appreciated playing with a legend. He was just an everyday bloke that just wanted to be around and enjoy the day. He was never hard to deal with, he was always fun. Lalor said Warne made sure even elite cricket retained a sense of joy. He had a point of difference... There\u2019s a lot of professionalism, I suppose, in cricket now but he just kept it real. Club president Paul Ryan said: Shane was the greatest cricketer our club has produced in its 168-year history. However, just as importantly he was also a great friend to many at our club and supporter of our club. Shane is, and will continue to be, greatly missed (but) we are very conscious that our loss needs to be kept in perspective with the devastation being felt by his children and family. It\u2019s worth noting that Marshall\u2019s seat of Dustan hasn\u2019t actually been called yet. It\u2019s tight and it\u2019s still conceivable that he could lose his seat entirely. Perhaps that\u2019s why his wording on \u201ccontinuing to serve the people of Dustan\u201d was so vauge. Steven Marshall also stated that he will continue to serve the people of Dustan. Steven Marshall has released a statement confirming that he is stepping down as leader of the SA Liberal party. Whilst I am disappointed by the election outcome, I take full responsibility for the result and accept the will of the people. This morning I visited the Governor... and advised her that I am unable to form government... I have also made the decision after more than 9 years as the leader of the Liberal Parliamentary Party, it is time for someone else to lead the team into the future. I will step down as leader as soon as the Party Room is able to meet to elect my successor. ABC Adelaide is reporting that ousted premier Steven Marshall will stand down as Liberal leader, making way for someone else to become opposition leader. Guardian Australia has yet to independently confirm. More to come. In a major campaign pledge, the Greens have put forward policy today to raise pensions, youth allowance, job seeker and other forms of income support payments to $88 a day. Here\u2019s what he had to say at a press conference today. If Liberal and Labor want to argue pensioners and job seekers should be living in poverty, bring it on... With the cost of living soaring and inflation a looming problem, raising the rate of income support is the urgent economic stimulus that will help lift wages from the bottom up. Currently, single people on the aged pension receive around $63 a day, or $95for couples. The European Union is under pressure to ban the import of kangaroo products following a push from a Dutch animal rights party, a move that if successful could collapse the kangaroo export market. Europe is the largest market for kangaroo meat and leather products. But animal rights activists say that the trade is incompatible with the EU\u2019s animal welfare requirements, and are building opposition to kangaroo products ahead of the EU-Australia free trade agreement. It follows a push to ban the import of kangaroo leather to the US. Legislation to stop the import of kangaroo products was introduced to congress last year but has not progressed. Read the full report below: Australia has banned the sale of alumina and aluminium ores to Russia in response to what it described as \u201cunrelenting and illegal aggression\u201d towards Ukraine. Also on Sunday, prime minister Scott Morrison announced Australia would donate coal and further military equipment to Ukraine to \u201csupport the brave and courageous resistance\u201d. \u201cRussia must pay a very high price for its brutality. It must pay that price economically, it must pay the price ... in diplomatic terms as well,\u201d Morrison said. The federal government has been under pressure to stop the export of alumina to Russia, with critics warning it was potentially allowing Australian resources to be used in munitions manufacturing. You can read the full report below: The bodies of a man and woman found floating in a dam in Queensland\u2019s South Burnett region are believed to be a local couple, AAP reports. Police believe they\u2019ve identified the two bodies found in the Gordonbrook Dam, about 250km northwest of Brisbane, at 3.30pm on Saturday. \u201cThe identities of the couple are yet to be confirmed however they are believed to be a local man aged in his fifties and a local woman aged in her late forties,\u201d detectives said in a statement on Sunday. Their white 2004 Holden Commodore station wagon has also been found parked near the picnic area at the dam. Police said the car is believed to have been there since at least February 22. They\u2019ve called for anyone who has seen the car or the couple in recent weeks to contact them. A little bit more on that planned paramedic strike in NSW tomorrow that I mentioned earlier. Did you know Australia has a world champion jouster? His name is Phillip Leitch and he showed off his skills with shield and lance at the first-ever Orange Medieval Faire. You can see all the amazing photos of this below: Morrison is asked whether the ousted South Australian Liberal premier, Steven Marshall, ran a \u201cweak campaign\u201d. He responds: Steven Marshall turned the state of South Australia around, he turned their economy around, he brought business back to South Australia, he created a new buzz in South Australia, which was drawing investment, technology firms, securing important events industry for his state. Steven Marshall ran a good show for the time he served as premier. He is asked what consequences the result has federally. I think state elections, and the new premier made this very point, even before the polls were opened, and that was that this election was being fought on state issues. The federal election will be fought on federal issues. And what I know is is that Anthony Albanese is not Peter Malinauskas, he is not any of the other premiers, he is not Annastacia Palaszczuk. He is none of these other premiers. Morrison is asked about allegations of bullying within the Labor party, which have emerged in the wake of senator Kimberley Kitching\u2019s death. Morrison says Anthony Albanese can\u2019t \u201cduck and run\u201d on the issue. This is a ... serious issue, the report that I\u2019ve seen of members of the Labor party, Labor members of parliament, senators, members of the union, coming forward and making some very, very serious allegations against not only the leadership but within the Senate of the Labor party, broadly in terms of what involvement that has been in turning the other way by the leader of the position. There is a very serious and there are serious issues that Anthony Albanese it has to deal with. This is on his watch, this only happened weeks ago and he can\u2019t duck and run on this. After thanking Whitehaven Coal for its donation to Ukraine, Morrison moves on to the South Australian election. He says he has spoken with Peter Malinauskas, the Labor leader, to offer his congratulations. Morrison says: It\u2019s a significant victory and they are elected with a very strong mandate to move forward with many issues that they\u2019ve intended take forward, we had a constructive conversation about the many projects that are already under way ... whether it\u2019s the program with the National Space Agency, the defence industry programs that are operating their manufacturing investments and I look forward to working with him on those many projects and welcome him to the national cabinet which is not scheduled to meet until June. Morrison then goes on to praise the ousted Liberal leader, Steven Marshall: To my dear friend, Steven Marshall, who has been an outstanding premier, I want to wish him all the very best and I want to thank him for the tremendous role that he played in turning around his own state, the entrepreneurial spirit which he pursued that role which seemed projects like so many others bring industry back into SS, bringing jobs back into the SA and singing people move back into SA, also lived in achievements and I want to thank him for his great leadership, I also want to thank him for the very positive and constructive role he played around the national cabinet table throughout the pandemic. The foreign minister, Marise Payne, is speaking now. She describes Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine as \u201cwar crimes\u201d. The targeting of innocent civilians and civilian infrastructure are war crimes. And president Putin must be held to account. Many people remain trapped in areas of escalating Russian aggression where the social services disrupted and unable to access a sufficient food or water or medication. And we know that the situation is dire. Morrison is announcing further measures to punish Russia and assist Ukraine. We\u2019ve already reported the measures. But in case you missed them, they are: An additional $21m in non-lethal military assistance for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, including ammunition, body armour and other defence material. An additional $30m in emergency humanitarian assistance to help meet the needs of the Ukrainian people, taking the total humanitarian assistance to $65m. A new temporary humanitarian visa for Ukrainian refugees fleeing the war, allowing them to work, study and access Medicare for three years. The donation of 70,000 tonnes of thermal coal to assist with Ukraine\u2019s energy security, following a request from Ukraine. The coal will be provided by Whitehaven Coal. A ban on exports of aluminium ores to Russia. This is designed to hamper its ability to manufacture aluminium, a major sector for the Russian economy, which is tied to its ability to manufacture arms. Morrison said: This significant step demonstrates our absolute commitment to holding the Putin regime to account and we won\u2019t cease until we are doing everything we possibly can. We identify new things that can be done every single day with our partners and with those around the world to put the maximum cost, for the maximum pressure on the Putin government withdraw from Ukraine and doing everything we can to continue to support the brave and courageous resistance that we are seeing from the people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine. Morrison is speaking now and is again urging Russia to withdraw its forces from Ukraine. He\u2019s also announcing new sanctions and new measures to support Ukraine, including refugees fleeing the war. We continue to call on Russia to immediately withdraw its forces from Ukraine, consistent with the legally binding decision of the International Court of Justice and to engage in dialogue and diplomacy in good faith. Russia\u2019s actions are a gross violation of international law. A gross violation of the principles that support a rules-based order that favours freedom and, as a result, are a threat to all who rely on them, including here in Australia and in our own region. Russia must pay a very high price for its brutality. It must pay that price economically, it must pay the price ... in diplomatic terms as well. And it is commented, paying the price. And the incredible resistance and courage that has been displayed by Ukraine, the Ukrainian people, by president Zelenskiy, the prime minister and his government, has been an extraordinary inspiration all around the world and Australia has played its part in providing encouragement to the people of Ukraine and to the government. We\u2019re expecting to hear from the prime minister, Scott Morrison, at any moment. He\u2019s due to speak at Kirribilli at 12pm. Stay tuned. While we\u2019re talking cost of living, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia has just urged the government to do more to reduce the costs of prescription medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme. The guild\u2019s national president, Prof Trent Twomey, said the PBS was one of the few practical levers the government had to reign in rising costs of living. Twomey said in a statement: One area it can act on is making medicines more affordable, and it\u2019s an area that voters are clearly wanting action on. Our research shows that a staggering 24% of non-concession card holders are struggling to afford their medicines. More than 13% have not filled a script over the last three years due to cost. The current general co-payment level of level of $42.50 is making medicines a luxury for middle income families. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 900,000 people delayed getting their prescriptions filled because of the cost. This is a damning situation, but it is one which the Government has the power to act on \u2013 and act on immediately. Hi everyone. It\u2019s Christopher Knaus here, taking over from Matilda Boseley. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, spoke to Sky News this morning, saying the looming budget will be used to address cost-of-living pressures. He said the government would take a \u201cprudent\u201d approach to spending and remain cautious of overheating the economy. Frydenberg said: I\u2019m not going to rule in and rule out specific measures other than to say the budget will help the rising cost of living that people are under but also do so in a way that doesn\u2019t overheat the economy. Australian paramedics association members will launch widespread industrial action in NSW tomorrow to protest understaffing. Ambulances will continue to operate, however, paramedics will not do a number of things, such as moving shifts to cover roster shortages and splitting from their partner. This is in addition to widespread chalking of messages on ambulance windows and comes just days after the SA election where Labor toppled the incumbent government by campaigning on a platform almost entirely focused on fixing issues with the state\u2019s ambulance services. Here is what the union had to say on Facebook. The adage in Australian politics is that people vote differently, and results don\u2019t always flow through, between state and federal elections \u2013 but that isn\u2019t stopping the Labor party from loudly crowing about what last night\u2019s South Australian result might mean for Scott Morrison\u2019s government in a few weeks\u2019 time. Labor\u2019s national president (and former treasurer), Wayne Swan, claims Peter Malinauskas\u2019 win \u201csends a clear message that voters have had enough of Liberal governments that are out of touch with their lives\u201d. In case you missed the not-so-subtle subtext there, Swan continued on in a statement to say the resounding Labor win \u201cshould have all of [Morrison\u2019s] MPs trembling.\u201d \u201cThis was not just about rejecting Steven Marshall\u2019s government \u2013 it was a rejection of the Liberals brand,\u201d Swan said. Whilst the failures and mistakes of premier Marshall played a big part, the person who has done the most damage to the Liberal party brand in Australia in the last three years is Scott Morrison. We\u2019ll be hearing from the prime minister after 12pm in a press conference where he\u2019ll no doubt give his own reflections on what the SA result means. Most pundits think there\u2019s only really one federal seat in play in that state, the Liberal-held electorate of Boothby, but Labor will be buoyed by the fact that Malinauskas\u2019 win represents the first time since the pandemic that an incumbent government has been turfed out \u2013 a feat Anthony Albanese will be trying to replicate at the federal poll in May. Tasmania\u2019s numbers are in. Today they have recorded 1,305 new infections and luckily, once again, no deaths. There are now 20 Covid-19 positive people in hospital in the state, including two in the ICU. Penny Wong says politics \u201cshould take a back seat\u201d in the wake of Kimberley Kitching\u2019s death, as she again denied reports that she bullied the late senator. Kitching, the Victorian Labor senator, died two weeks ago aged 52. Wong, Labor\u2019s Senate leader, and colleagues Kristina Keneally and Katy Gallagher had been accused in some media reports of having ostracised Kitching before her death. In a lengthy interview on Channel Nine this morning, Wong said she and her colleagues had tried to exercise \u201ccommon decency\u201d by not commenting at length on the allegations. Kitching\u2019s funeral will be held tomorrow in Melbourne. Wong praised Kitching as \u201can extraordinary politician\u201d, and shared her condolences with the late senator\u2019s family and friends. But asked whether she bullied Kitching, Wong responded: \u201cNo I did not.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of things said, a lot of claims made, a lot of views shared, I do think there are times where politics, you know, should take a back seat,\u201d she told host Chris Uhlmann. There\u2019s politics and there\u2019s family. This is the time for family. Without naming names, Wong called on \u201csome of those making claims\u201d in the wake of Kitching\u2019s death \u201cto reflect on whether or not that they are expressing the common decency\u201d. She added that she believed politicians \u201cshould be held to a common standard around behaviour\u201d, admitting that \u201cI don\u2019t think any party is perfect\u201d. Visitors will once again be allowed to visit family members at St Vincent\u2019s hospital in Melbourne. Of course, Malinauskas\u2019 campaign had a vast focus on ambulance ramping and delays, but he denies accusations that he overpromised or in any way mislead voters about his ability to entirely fix the issue. Reporter: If in four years\u2019 time ambulances are still being ramped at hospitals, even if it has come down substantially from say October last year, that people will presume your government to have failed? Malinauskas: No. Reporter: Why? Malinauskas: Because they have been utterly honest and people have protectors. Rory asked me this question three or four times throughout the campaign. They made it really clear to South Australians repeatedly through the course of the campaign that any politician who promises to eliminate ramping forever which, I think, is what Steven Marshall was doing, is just irresponsible, but we can do is dramatically reduced ramping to a level that ensures that when 000 gets called the ambulance rolls up on time. And that is the commitment we have made. Peter Malinauskas just said that the prime minister texted him as he was speaking at this press conference. He says that although he will work constructively with Scott Morrison, he will be doing everything in his power to get Anthony Albanese into office. I will say this. This is, I don\u2019t think, an unreasonable expectation ... I will be doing everything they can to help [Albanese] become the next prime minister of Australia. But, at the same time, in the interim, will work collaboratively with the federal government. Simon Birmingham has reached out to me this morning. I think literally just as I was walking over here, a text message may have come through from the prime minister, so as soon as this press conference is over I will be getting back to him as soon as possible. Let\u2019s be clear about this, I will work collaboratively with any government of any persuasion that is willing to do the right thing by SA, plain and simple. If there are examples of where the federal Coalition want to do something good by our state, I will acknowledge it ... If they do something I don\u2019t agree with a stand and fight for our interests. And if the government changes federally in a few months we will time, it will be the same rules ... but, naturally, I sincerely hope it is Anthony Albanese because we have common values, we understand the post-pandemic opportunity and I will be doing everything they can to assist his efforts in getting re-elected. Malinauskas: Look, I think that in politics, there is a high value placed on the role of the leader, and that is utterly understandable. Of course, it is important. But make no mistake. This has been a team effort. From the shadow cabinet through to the caucus, everybody else involved in the Labor movement. We have worked with unanimity and absolute determination to ensure that we offer a stable alternative. I place a value on stability but also on renewal, and in the coming days we will be doing important work to ensure that the cabinet I lead is a strong one, a united one, which puts the interests of South Australians first. We have a big policy agenda and we need a high-quality team to deliver that. And I will make whatever decisions are required to ensure we achieve that outcome. Malinauskas: I want to work collaboratively with all the members of our community, but I said from the start I was going to be a pro-business Labor leader. I\u2019ve already been in touch with some business leaders this morning and I will be speaking to more throughout the course of the day and the days ahead. I do believe our economy works best when we achieve the right balance between the interests of capital and labour, and only the Labor party understands the importance of that. When you have a pro-business Labor party, you see the interests of working people working together with the interests of business, to ensure that our economy delivers for everybody, not just the few. And when you combine that with thoughtful policy around key government services, particularly at a state level, education and obviously health, we can do good things to help people out. But we also have a program and agenda that speaks to the long-term interests of our state. They wouldn\u2019t have been, I think it is fair to say, too many people casting their ballots yesterday top of mind thinking about three-year-old preschool, but I can assure you it is top of my mind because that is the sort of reform that sets up our state for the future. That is the sort of reform that will start to see a long-term dividend that we will not see the benefit of the 20 or even 30 years, but I want to be party to a government that inks about the long-term. If South Australian is decided one thing above all else last night it is that they don\u2019t want a government just thinking about the next four years. They want to government thinking about the next generation. Looks like we will be hearing from the prime minister at 12pm AEDT. Malinauskas says winning the SA state election was a \u201chumbling\u201d experience. So, look, obviously last night was a significant electoral outcome. And again, I want to reiterate the message that I thank the people of South Australia. I woke up very early this morning, fully conscious of the fact that the people of our state have their confidence and faith in my leadership, and the ambition of my team. That is an incredibly humbling thing to think about. It is a humbling experience, to have other people put their confidence in you. And I want to thank the people of South Australia for doing that. Billy the task before us is very substantial. We have a number of issues we would like to address in the community. Some are going to be difficult, some will be challenging and take time, others are particularly urgent. But it is a task we are wholeheartedly committed to, and we get to work today. There is not a moment to lose to make sure we capitalise on the post pandemic opportunity we have in Australia that South Australia. Malinauskas: So I stand here today as the leader of a modern Labor party that reflects our society, a very high proportion of female members of parliament, five brand-new members of parliament, all young, all-female, to ensure that this parliament reflects the society that we live in, that this party reflects the future of our state, that this parliament reflects the collective ambition of Labor to ensure that our policy addresses the needs of modern families and, in no small part of the five women that Susan and I stand in front of today are a reflection of that. The soon to be new South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, is speaking as he takes his victory lap after a landslide win in yesterday\u2019s state election. We have a substantial policy agenda before us. If there is one thing that excites me more than anything else about our success electorally yesterday is that we have one with a policy vision and agenda for the future of our state, this idea that oppositions have to run small target strategies and abandon ideas in order to win elections, well, that has been completely dispensed to the boundary before last night. We have one government with a very substantial policy that we are taking to the selection, and in no small part that is because of Susan\u2019s hard work and I do want to thank Susan for that. Of course, one of the keys to the electoral success that my team experienced last night is the fact that we have preselected incredibly well. We knew from the outset that to be able to form a government it was going to take a lot of hard work on the ground, to preselect high-quality candidates that had the ability to take up the challenge of beating first-term MPs in many instances. Residents in Lismore have been left with no choice but to move back into their houses that have been deemed uninhabitable, with some sleeping on swags in mouldy rooms without electricity, as they are unable to find safe accommodation three weeks after floods devastated the town. In south Lismore \u2013 a low-lying part of the town that bore the brunt of historic flooding this year and an area well known for attracting residents seeking affordable housing \u2013 Guardian Australia spoke with multiple residents who had evacuated town following the floods but had returned to their homes in recent days. The State Emergency Service had deemed more than 3,600 homes across the New South Wales northern rivers region as uninhabitable and on Friday some residents were living in homes that had been as assessed as such. You can read the full report below: Support for mental health will be one the key planks of the federal budget in just over a week\u2019s time, the health minister, Greg Hunt, says. Hunt says mental health is one of the four pillars of Australia\u2019s long-term national health plan. The other areas are primary care with a strong focus on access to new medicines and better treatments to aid doctors, the support for hospitals and private health insurance, and medical research. He said there will be focus on youth suicide. Hunt told Sky News\u2019 Sunday Agenda program: Despite all the expectations because of what we were able to do in tailored support for mental health we had a reduction in suicide in Australia of five per cent in 2020 \u2013 we are still waiting the final figures for 2021 ... We want to see it go lower, we want to see it head towards zero. Details on the mental health support will be released in the 29 March budget. However, the Morrison government will spend more than $315m over four years to extend its national ice action strategy in the ongoing fight to reduce the impact of ice, other drugs and alcohol. This investment comes alongside an additional $27.9m being committed to support other critical drug and alcohol treatment projects in areas of identified need. For too many Australians, illegal drugs are still an insidious scourge on our community, robbing families of their loved ones ... The Morrison government is committed to building safe and healthy communities, reducing the impacts and harms of drug and alcohol use for individuals, their families and their communities. National wastewater drug monitoring shows methamphetamine use has reduced for the second consecutive year. Even so, Hunt said while this was a good sign, there is still work to be done. Speers: My question was. If [Albanese] won\u2019t hold an inquiry, then Peter Dutton is suggesting that the Senate might do something. You are the Senate Leader. Would you support some other form of inquiry? Birmingham: I\u2019m yet to see any proposal that I think we would support, David. These are matters for the Labor party and for Anthony Albanese first and foremost to address. We are seeing the issues are not being raised by Liberals, they are being raised by union leaders, by Labor party figures, by those within Labor party ranks and it is a [deflection] of leadership by Anthony Albanese to not be responding to those directly and address these issues. He would always grandstand when it is the Liberal party yet missing in action when it is the Labor party. Birmingham has been asked for his take about the allegations of bullying from within the Labor party focused around federal MP Kimberley Kitching who recently passed away due to a heart attack. Speers: Finally, on the treatment of Kimberley Kitching within the Labor party, your colleague Peter Dutton says if Labor won\u2019t hold an inquiry, others in the Senate will look at options they can take the will the Government support some sort of Senate or other inquiry? Birmingham: David, I think these matters are first and foremost for Anthony Albanese. You know full well that if the shoe the were on the other foot, if a Labor senator or shadow minister was sitting in this chair at present and the allegations pertained to a Liberal or National individual, then you would have had a string of outraged comments coming from those Labor figures as we have seen and that they would be calling for Scott Morrison to take strong action. Well, Anthony Albanese should stop hiding, should stop hiding behind existing processes and vague answers and refusing to turn up to press conferences and he should respond, he should show some semblance of leadership because at present it is completely absent. The federal finance minister, Simon Birmingham, has been asked if the SA election results make him nervous about the upcoming federal vote. Birmingham: Our election was always going to be a challenging one and I don\u2019t think we have ever underestimated the challenges that lie ahead, but we remain determined to make sure Australians understand the choice ahead of them, and that choice is between a strength of leadership and strength of economic management our government has delivered with 1.7m more jobs created. And Anthony Albanese is a leader who has never supported a tax, and terms of economics management and national security are completely untested. Insiders host David Speers: But you are saying bad luck, the electorate was tricked. Doesn\u2019t sound like there is any reflection or acceptance that the Liberals did anything wrong? Finance minister, Simon Birmingham: As I say, David, I think they were a very good government in many ways, and that this was a very short-run campaign. Peter Malinauskas and the Labor party and I congratulate Peter and will work with him as closely as I can for the good of South Australia \u2013 but I think they really launched their campaign in a short, targeted, focused way. We\u2019ve already had Mark Kenny on your program acknowledge that it was a singularly focused campaign by them, and it was. For any South Australians living here, you would be hard-pressed to identify one other issue outside of health and ambulance ramping that they really campaigned on. Speers: But you are not accepting any mistake, fault, problem, blame on the Liberal side? Birmingham: David, no government is perfect and so there will be lessons from the campaign. The federal finance minister, Simon Birmingham, is appearing on ABC\u2019s Insiders now, and of course, has been asked why the Liberals experienced a landslide loss in the state election there overnight. Birmingham says that a number of voters were potentially tricked by \u201cmisleading statements\u201d about Labor\u2019s ability to stop ambulance ramping. I think always when an election is lost, there are a number of factors at play. I think that history will judge Steven Marshall\u2019s government for its policy achievements and management more kindly than the electorate did yesterday. The economic confidence he delivered to South Australia, the ongoing growth in what will be higher-paying, more highly skilled [workers] in SA for many years to come, the transformation of schooling SA, investments in hospitals, these will be positives which he will be marked up for but clearly a disappointing day for the Liberal family in SA to have that result. The campaign was one in which we saw the Labor party run a very targeted, very singularly focused campaign around hospitals and ambulances. I think there were many misleading aspects to that campaign and even the Electoral Commission found so in the last day or so, but that again is a reminder to all of us that we can\u2019t underscore the potential for Labor to run these types of scare campaigns just like they did with mediscare back in 2016, particularly when they can roll out the public sector unions to devastating effects. Insiders host David Speers: So is that your take on this election result, the electorate was tricked? Birmingham: No, not entirely. I do think that Labor\u2019s campaign was effective, but I also think, as the Electoral Commission found, that it was based on misleading statements and that of course is something that does mean that some voters potentially were tricked but equally I think Covid did play a very difficult role for Steven Marshall. When he opened the borders from SA to the rest of the country on 23 November, it was 24 November, the very day after that Omicron was first reported to the World Health Organization as a variant of concern. You couldn\u2019t have had perhaps more unlucky timing than Steven Marshall faced in that regard and that the carefully calibrated plans he had for reopening were clearly blown out of the water at that time and that did create real challenges for the Government through the run-up and lead-up to the election, and, of course, in terms of what the narrative of their campaign was. I believe this may be the first day in many months that Victoria has recorded no Covid-19 deaths. Apologies, I previously stated that the state recorded 16,965 cases - this was the number of PRC tests that were conducted yesterday. Victoria actually recorded 6,694 new infections. The Australian government has just expanded its sanctions on Russia to now include all aluminium ores. About 20% of the alumina produced by major mining corporation Queensland Alumina Ltd is sold to the Russian run Rusal company. Here is what DFAT had to say in a statement this morning: Australia has prohibited the export of aluminium ores (including bauxite), alumina and related products to Russia. The Autonomous Sanctions (Export Sanctioned Goods\u2014Russia) Designation 2022 (the Designation) designates aluminium ores (including bauxite), alumina and related products as \u2018export sanctioned goods\u2019 for Russia. The Designation commenced on 20 March 2022. The goods designated by the Designation are key components in the manufacture and development of weapons. Australia has prohibited the export of these goods to, or for the benefit of, Russia. I\u2019ll bring you more on this soon. Looks like we will be hearing from the newly elected SA premier this morning as well. Australia will donate military equipment and coal to Ukraine\u2019s effort to defend its country from invasion while placing additional sanctions on Russia, the prime minister has announced the morning. Following discussions between the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the defence minister, Peter Dutton, and their Ukrainian counterparts, an additional $21m worth of Australian Defence Force stock will seek to meet priority requests from Ukraine. Australia will donate at least 70,000 tonnes of thermal coal for Ukraine\u2019s power stations and withhold bauxite, used to make aluminium, from Russia. An additional $30m in humanitarian assistance will focus on protecting displaced women and children and addressing food shortages. Despite a major surge in cost-of-living pressures, Australians are overspending to keep up with friends and family, researchers say. A national poll of 1,000 adults by consumer comparison site Finder reveals 47% feel pressure from within their social circle to keep pace financially, AAP reports. About 20% of adults, or the equivalent of 4.3 million people provided the findings are accurate, concede going into debt or spending more than they can afford due to peer influence. Apparently, it isn\u2019t just trivial purchases either. About 28% of respondents said they felt forced into splitting restaurant bills despite ordering less, while 9% \u201chad to\u201d fund a bucks or hens night and 7% felt obliged to fork out for someone else\u2019s baby shower. However about 14% said they\u2019d been coerced into an expensive holiday with loved ones, and 8% even admitted buying cars, homes and designer goods to keep up. Personal finance expert Kate Browne said while no one wants to be a party pooper, there are more affordable alternatives. You can always be honest with your loved ones and say while you value spending time with them, you don\u2019t want to spend too much money doing it. At the end of the day, it\u2019s your money and you get to decide how you spend it. On average, men estimate they\u2019ve overspent more than $1,500 over the past six months and women more than $900 to appease friends and family, with millennials apparently most vulnerable to the trap. Meanwhile, the cost of essentials keeps rising. Separate research by consumer networks Frugl Grocery and One Big Switch shows fruit and vegetable prices at some major supermarkets are up 5% on a year ago. Drinks are 7.7% more expensive and pantry items 5%. One Big Switch also cites a 12% jump in regional rents and predicts a 4.1% annual increase in daycare fees over the next four years. However Finder\u2019s latest Consumer Sentiment Tracker indicates 25% of people agree fuel is now their most stressful cost, up from 17% in January and 11% a year ago. The Queensland premier has taken to Twitter to congratulate her new Labor peer. Good morning everyone, welcome to Sunday! It\u2019s Matilda Boseley here and while you are recovering from a big Saturday night you can leave the news to me, because I\u2019ll be here to guide you through all the important updates on this fine morning. Of course, we are going to start with the results of the SA election, where Labor\u2019s Peter Malinauskas has ousted Liberal premier Steven Marshall, turning the state red. Labor looks set to hold at least 25 and possibly as many as 27 seats in the 47-seat House of Assembly after a big swing in Saturday\u2019s poll. The Liberals were expected to retain at least 15 seats with independents poised to take the remaining five. The Electoral Commission had Labor\u2019s primary vote up by eight percentage points to 40.5% with the Liberals on 34.5%. But the counting isn\u2019t done, with the votes still being tallied for the five seats still considered to be in doubt. Interestingly this includes Dunstan, which of course is held by outgoing premier Marshall. In his concession speech, Marshall said it had been an honour and privilege to serve the people of South Australia. It\u2019s great to live in a country where we have free and open elections... Today the people of South Australia have spoken. They\u2019ve elected a new government. But he was tight-lipped on Saturday as to if he would stay on as opposition leader should he retain his own seat. OK, with that, why don\u2019t we jump right into the day!",

Before our current age of Insta-controversies and aggregated showbiz news, it was widely known that screenwriter Joe Eszterhas had sold his screenplay for a record $3m and that demonstrators in San Francisco, including Eszterhas himself, had protested against the film\u2019s association of lesbianism with violent psychosis. It was known that director Paul Verhoeven had battled the MPAA from an NC-17 rating to the hardest of R ratings in the states, and it took no time for buzz to circulate about the famed interrogation scene, where Catherine Trammell, the author and might-be murderess played by Sharon Stone, uncrosses her legs before a roomful of sweat-drenched men.

The design of <a href=\"https://www.thelalee.co.uk\" title=\"\">the LaLee</a> at the Cadogan hotel in Chelsea is all wrong. It doesn\u2019t quite function. It feels like a restaurant put together by excitable designers who were thrilled with their cloth swatches, and their rug choices and the overall branding, but whose attention drifted during the meetings when the hotel\u2019s food and beverage people explained what kind of a joint they actually had in mind.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with the branding. The LaLee was the name of the personalised railway carriage used by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/feb/13/lily-langtry-death\" title=\"\">Lillie Langtry</a>, the actor and society figure, when she was touring America in the 19th century. The link being that Langtry\u2019s townhouse at 21 Pont Street is now a part of the hotel. This is not the first time the Cadogan has attempted to cash in on her name. A couple of owners back they opened a car crash of a place called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/mar/11/foodanddrink.shopping2\" title=\"\">Langtry\u2019s</a>, where the menu included a deconstructed prawn cocktail \u2013 shellfish jelly, battered prawns, a Marie Rose ice-cream made from mayonnaise and tomato ketchup \u2013 thoughts of which sometimes haunt me in the darkest hours before dawn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9d9a26838c96d2d668d71aa80d80b88443c0ceb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9d9a26838c96d2d668d71aa80d80b88443c0ceb/0_136_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The mayonnaise really is whipped up from scratch\u2019: Caesar salad.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The mayonnaise really is whipped up from scratch\u2019: Caesar salad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>None of the food here is as catastrophic as that, but the link is made uneasily. Langtry is portrayed in the menu text as a woman whose only currency was sex appeal; as the proverbial good time had by all. Starters are introduced as \u201ca little flirtation before the main event\u201d. Desserts are \u201cscandalously sweet to make you swoon\u201d. This might work if you were here on a date, but rather less so if, say, you\u2019d booked in for lunch with Derek from accounts so you could go over the year-end numbers. The mains are described as \u201cheavenly main dishes from Europe\u2019s finest cities\u201d. This amounts to a schnitzel, steak and chips, a rack of lamb, an aubergine parmigiana for two and so on, all at Chelsea prices, that price being roughly \u00a330 a pop. It\u2019s sold as high glamour. In truth, it\u2019s a menu designed for well-heeled tourists on the fourth day of their London trip when they can\u2019t be fagged to leave the hotel to eat.</p> <p>So why did I bother going? For one reason: they also promise culinary tableside theatre. I\u2019m a complete sucker for this. I love it when a skilled waiter turns up next to my table with a box of tricks and some killer moves to prepare my dinner in front of me. It\u2019s very old school and it\u2019s utterly beguiling. Here they promise to do the business with both a Caesar salad and a steak tartare. Which is where it all gets a bit messy. A trolley might be a good idea for this. Instead, they\u2019ve got white, spindly- legged wooden tables, which may be very expensive, but look instead like allen key jobs from the Ikea New England Cottage range. Moving them is a two-person task. While we wait to be served, there\u2019s much table moving from one plushly furnished room to another. Oh look, they\u2019re coming back again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1c1a9161e7806b39fd03d5427fce99605d7e8d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1c1a9161e7806b39fd03d5427fce99605d7e8d8/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Properly piquant\u2019: steak tartare.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Properly piquant\u2019: steak tartare.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Finally, it\u2019s our turn. And it is tableside. It\u2019s just not our tableside. Presumably it\u2019s the designer who has insisted on arranging the room in such a way that the one for the Caesar has to be placed a full 5ft away from us to our left across the aisle next to a booth. The steak tartare table is far over the other side of the unoccupied table to our right. This makes watching the whole theatre you\u2019ve come for very tricky. There simply isn\u2019t room to pull off the thing they want to do. (Similarly, the rug on the parquet floor isn\u2019t big enough for all the tables in this room, so one foot of my chair is off when we arrive, creating an instant wobble. We take things into our own hands and rearrange the furniture.)</p> <p>But as ever, I must accentuate the positive. The waiters do a truly beautiful job, even if we have to crane our necks to watch them do it. The mayonnaise for the Caesar really is whipped up from scratch and the cos salad is big on the salted anchovies, as I requested. The steak tartare is properly piquant, again as requested. A bit of toast wouldn\u2019t have gone amiss with the latter given the \u00a320 price tag, but hey. Still, both dishes really are as good as any you\u2019ll find in London right now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63ec60bde3acd03343ecacd735f35383567c6490\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63ec60bde3acd03343ecacd735f35383567c6490/0_45_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Comes with some fennel\u2019: sea bass.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Comes with some fennel\u2019: sea bass.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After that, it\u2019s all about as humdrum as you might imagine from the menu descriptions: serviceable lamb chops that could have done with more time under the grill; a meagre half fillet of sea bass for \u00a326 with some fennel; overly thick courgette fries, so the overcoat of batter is undercooked at the heart. Dessert is just unfortunate. A madeleine served warm from the oven is a joy. These are overcooked and dry. The savarin, or yeasted sponge cake at the heart of the rum baba, should be a gorgeous, bronzed and burnished thing. This is just an oversoaked puck of dense sponge.</p> <p>Still, it\u2019s a nice place for dinner and a quiet chat. Or it would be, were it not for the stern man in the next room who keeps shouting. Because the LaLee has a big open kitchen. These can be great in chattery, clattery brasseries where the kitchen noise disappears into the general hubbub. They can also work in those high gastronomic temples where the monastic brigade has developed a sign language involving the positioning of tweezers on their apron straps and imperceptible hand gestures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44021dc61344b07f8ceb6bc4aa21bf4a154e4335\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44021dc61344b07f8ceb6bc4aa21bf4a154e4335/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Oversoaked puck of dense sponge\u2019: rum baba.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018An oversoaked puck of dense sponge\u2019: rum baba.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The LaLee is neither of these. It\u2019s a mildly chintzy place of quiet, civilised conversation, constantly broken by the head chef barking orders at his crew, as if the kitchen is behind a door. For the diners who have chosen the two tables in front of the kitchen I imagine it\u2019s fine. For the rest of us it\u2019s just plain weird. I\u2019ve long felt sympathy for cooks who merely want to do their job, but have been put on display in an open kitchen as part of the experience. Here, because of the jarring way in which the place has been designed, that issue is just emphasised. It rather sums up the LaLee. It\u2019s attempting to be a thrilling destination restaurant, when in truth it should just be the utilitarian dining option in a fancy boutique London hotel.

      "body": "<p><em><strong>The question </strong>I have realised that after two years of working from home I cannot work in an office. My manager has recently mandated that we all work from the office on certain days of the week. I now spend half an hour each way crammed into a smelly, dirty train. I started this job during the pandemic, so I was nervous to go into the office and meet my colleagues. Well, my worst fears came true, because on my first day, the first colleague I met tried to get me fired. He said I wasn\u2019t wearing my lanyard and reported it to my boss.</em></p> <p><em>Since then I\u2019ve met the rest of the team and I experienced a not insubstantial amount of sectarianism and sexism. But it\u2019s not just that. I now find I\u2019m hypersensitive to any noise. I\u2019m acutely sensitive to people chewing with their mouths open, slurping soup and gossiping loudly. Not only that, but my stomach rumbles and I find it excruciatingly embarrassing. I want the ground to swallow me up. Working from home, none of this was an issue. I can\u2019t go on like this. Aside from getting a medical certificate, which I obviously don\u2019t want to do, how can I approach my office to request I work from home permanently?</em></p> <p><em><strong>Philippa\u2019s answer </strong></em>There are many like you who got used to working from home. Comfort zones for being with colleagues appear to have, in many people\u2019s experience, diminished.</p> <p>During the pandemic, it was repeatedly implied to us that other people were dangerous, potential killers, even. Shops and offices are still full of signs reminding us to keep our distance and wash our hands. Every factual TV series made since the pandemic shows people standing far apart from each other with an unnatural distance. This is all very sensible as a precaution against the virus, but what has it done to our psyches? It has reinforced any anxiety we may have had about others and made us more wary of our fellow human beings. It makes me sad.</p> <p>After so long being on our own, the sounds and smells of other people may very well feel jarring. We got used to the quiet and now normal noise feels horribly over-stimulating and the situation has made us even more conscious of the normal noises our bodies make. Many people report feeling overstimulated and exhausted after re-entry post lockdown. I was among them. Many of us have had to build up again gradually, and I think you will need to do this, too.</p> <p>Like many creatures, human beings are pack animals. If you remove a fruit fly from its fellow fruit flies, isolate it and then re-introduce it into the swarm, it doesn\u2019t plunge back into the centre, but hides around the edges. It is as though it got used to loneliness and dare not risk what might feel like further rejection by diving back in. I\u2019ve heard the same thing happens with rats, and for sure after isolation we humans feel shyer and hypervigilant for potential rejection.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get fired for forgetting your lanyard</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are two things we can do with these feelings of fear and distrust: we can be ruled by the feeling and stay hidden, or we can feel the fear and join in anyway. If we hide, we carry on feeding our fears, but if we dare to feel them and act in spite of them, they will gradually diminish as we establish relationships and re-enter the fray, even when we had believed we would not.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get fired for forgetting your lanyard. How kind of your colleague to ask your boss if you had been issued with one (there\u2019s always another interpretation for a story). Forming cliques is universal within all human groups and we won\u2019t educate anyone about sexism by hiding away. It can be awkward joining a group that is already established, as relationships take time. But what is good about them at work is that the clich\u00e9 of two brains being better than one is true. We can have video meetings, but so much more creativity and problem-solving happens chatting by the water cooler.</p> <p>When you enter a full room and think no one will be interested in you and other people are all horrible, what vibe do you give off? But if you walk in expecting everyone to be kind, interesting and attractive and you are, too, how different would your demeanour be? And what difference would that make to the experience?</p> <p>I doubt there is harm in telling your boss that you work better at home, but it\u2019s not guaranteed to work. I would encourage you, instead, to realise not all humans are all bad, and some of them are really great and will be fun and interesting to work with.</p> <p>You have been searching for evidence to the contrary; I want you instead, to search for the good.</p> <p>It\u2019s time to be a little bit more optimistic about what people are like and gently push out the edges of your comfort zone, so that you can ease yourself back in and be less anxious about being part of a group again. You have an advantage over the fruit fly \u2013 you can decide to acknowledge your instincts, understand them and choose to override them.</p> <p><em>If you have a question, send a brief email to <a href=\"mailto:askphilippa@observer.co.uk\">askphilippa@observer.co.uk</a></em></p>",

I started this job during the pandemic, so I was nervous to go into the office and meet my colleagues. Well, my worst fears came true, because on my first day, the first colleague I met tried to get me fired. He said I wasn\u2019t wearing my lanyard and reported it to my boss. Since then I\u2019ve met the rest of the team and I experienced a not insubstantial amount of sectarianism and sexism. But it\u2019s not just that. I now find I\u2019m hypersensitive to any noise. I\u2019m acutely sensitive to people chewing with their mouths open, slurping soup and gossiping loudly. Not only that, but my stomach rumbles and I find it excruciatingly embarrassing. I want the ground to swallow me up. Working from home, none of this was an issue. I can\u2019t go on like this. Aside from getting a medical certificate, which I obviously don\u2019t want to do, how can I approach my office to request I work from home permanently? Philippa\u2019s answer There are many like you who got used to working from home. Comfort zones for being with colleagues appear to have, in many people\u2019s experience, diminished. During the pandemic, it was repeatedly implied to us that other people were dangerous, potential killers, even. Shops and offices are still full of signs reminding us to keep our distance and wash our hands. Every factual TV series made since the pandemic shows people standing far apart from each other with an unnatural distance. This is all very sensible as a precaution against the virus, but what has it done to our psyches? It has reinforced any anxiety we may have had about others and made us more wary of our fellow human beings. It makes me sad. After so long being on our own, the sounds and smells of other people may very well feel jarring. We got used to the quiet and now normal noise feels horribly over-stimulating and the situation has made us even more conscious of the normal noises our bodies make. Many people report feeling overstimulated and exhausted after re-entry post lockdown. I was among them. Many of us have had to build up again gradually, and I think you will need to do this, too. Like many creatures, human beings are pack animals. If you remove a fruit fly from its fellow fruit flies, isolate it and then re-introduce it into the swarm, it doesn\u2019t plunge back into the centre, but hides around the edges. It is as though it got used to loneliness and dare not risk what might feel like further rejection by diving back in. I\u2019ve heard the same thing happens with rats, and for sure after isolation we humans feel shyer and hypervigilant for potential rejection. There are two things we can do with these feelings of fear and distrust: we can be ruled by the feeling and stay hidden, or we can feel the fear and join in anyway. If we hide, we carry on feeding our fears, but if we dare to feel them and act in spite of them, they will gradually diminish as we establish relationships and re-enter the fray, even when we had believed we would not. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get fired for forgetting your lanyard. How kind of your colleague to ask your boss if you had been issued with one (there\u2019s always another interpretation for a story). Forming cliques is universal within all human groups and we won\u2019t educate anyone about sexism by hiding away. It can be awkward joining a group that is already established, as relationships take time. But what is good about them at work is that the clich\u00e9 of two brains being better than one is true. We can have video meetings, but so much more creativity and problem-solving happens chatting by the water cooler. When you enter a full room and think no one will be interested in you and other people are all horrible, what vibe do you give off? But if you walk in expecting everyone to be kind, interesting and attractive and you are, too, how different would your demeanour be? And what difference would that make to the experience? I doubt there is harm in telling your boss that you work better at home, but it\u2019s not guaranteed to work. I would encourage you, instead, to realise not all humans are all bad, and some of them are really great and will be fun and interesting to work with. You have been searching for evidence to the contrary; I want you instead, to search for the good. It\u2019s time to be a little bit more optimistic about what people are like and gently push out the edges of your comfort zone, so that you can ease yourself back in and be less anxious about being part of a group again. You have an advantage over the fruit fly \u2013 you can decide to acknowledge your instincts, understand them and choose to override them.

The author is the former US ambassador to Ukraine who Trump fired during his attempt to withhold aid to Kyiv in return for political dirt, an effort that got him impeached. For the first time.</p> <p>Yovanovitch tells a story of an immigrant\u2019s success. But, of course, her short but momentous stint in the last administration receives particular attention.</p> <p>On the page, Yovanovitch berates Trump for \u201chis obsequiousness to Putin\u201d, which she says was a \u201cfrequent and continuing cause for concern\u201d among the diplomatic corps.

If only thousands of dead Russian troops could talk.</p> <p>Trump was commander-in-chief but according to Yovanovitch, he didn\u2019t exactly have the best handle on where his soldiers were deployed.</p> <p>At an Oval Office meeting in 2017 with Petro Poroshenko, then president of Ukraine, Trump asked HR McMaster, his national security adviser, if US troops were deployed in Donbas in eastern Ukraine, territory now invoked by Putin as grounds for his invasion.</p> <p>\u201cAn affirmative answer to that question would have meant that the United States was in a shooting war with Russia,\u201d Yovanovitch writes.</p> <p>In the moment, she says, she also pondered if it was \u201cbetter to interpret Trump\u2019s question as suggesting that the commander-in-chief thought it possible that US troops were fighting Russia-led forces, or instead as an indicator that the president wasn\u2019t clear which country was on the other side of the war against Ukraine\u201d.</p> <p>Let that sink in. And remember this. According to Mary Trump, the former president\u2019s niece, Trump mocked his father as he <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-mocked-father-for-alzheimers-mary-trump-book-claims-2020-6\">succumbed to Alzheimer\u2019s</a>.</p> <p>Yovanovitch\u2019s parents fled the Nazis, then the Soviets. She was born in Canada and her family moved to the US when she was three. Later she received an offer from Smith, an all-women\u2019s school in Massachusetts, but opted for Princeton. It had gone co-ed less than a decade earlier but Yovanovitch counted on it being more fun.</p> <p>In her memoir, she devotes particular attention to snubs and put-downs endured on account of gender. One of her professors, a European history specialist, announced that he opposed women being admitted. After that, Yovanovitch stayed silent during discussion. It was only after she received an A, she writes, that the professor noticed her and made sure to include her. She really had something to say.</p> <p>Lessons from the Edge also recalls a sex discrimination lawsuit brought in 1976 by Alison Palmer, a retired foreign service officer, against the US Department of State. The case was settled, but only in 1989 and with an acknowledgment of past wrongs by the department.</p> <p>State had \u201cdisproportionately given men the good assignments\u201d, Palmer said. Yovanovitch writes: \u201cI felt \u2013 and still feel \u2013 tremendous gratitude to [her] for fighting for me and so many other women.\u201d</p> <p>Yovanovitch would serve in Moscow and as US ambassador to Kyrgyzstan, Armenia and Ukraine. She worked with political appointees and careerists. She offers particular praise for Republicans of an earlier, saner era.</p> <p>She lauds George Shultz, Ronald Reagan\u2019s secretary of state, for professionalism and commitment to country. Shultz reminded new ambassadors that \u201cmy\u201d country meant the US, not their place of posting. He also viewed diplomacy as a constant effort, as opposed to a spasmodic intervention.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In 2020, Mike Pompeo screamed at a reporter: \u2018Do you think Americans give a fuck about Ukraine?\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yovanovitch also singles out James Baker, secretary of state to George HW Bush, for helping the president forge a coalition to win the Gulf war.</p> <p>\u201cDepartment folks found him cold and aloof,\u201d Yovanovitch recalls. \u201cBut it was clear immediately that he was a master of diplomacy.\u201d</p> <p>Baker showed flashes of idealism. The US stood for something. As younger men, both Shultz and Baker were marines.</p> <p>In marked contrast, Yovanovitch gives the Trump administration a thumping. She brands Rex Tillerson\u2019s 14-month tenure as secretary of state as \u201cnear-disastrous\u201d. As for Tillerson\u2019s successor, Mike Pompeo, Yovanovitch lambasts his \u201cfaux swagger\u201d and his refusal to defend her when she came under attack from Trump and his minions.</p> <p>Amid Trump\u2019s first impeachment, over Ukraine, Yovanovitch testified: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/11/15/20966520/trump-twitter-impeachment-hearings-witness-intimidation\">The policy process is visibly unravelling</a> \u2026 the state department is being hollowed out.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c3ae77f2994246f5cf8d8538c54ea0d0fac8dd8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3ae77f2994246f5cf8d8538c54ea0d0fac8dd8f/0_275_2682_1610/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Pompeo and Volodymyr Zelenskiy shake hands in Kyiv in 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike Pompeo and Volodymyr Zelenskiy shake hands in Kyiv in 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Loyalty to subordinates was not Pompeo\u2019s thing \u2013 or Trump\u2019s. \u201cLick what\u2019s above you, kick what\u2019s below you\u201d \u2013 that was more their mantra.

Lessons from the Edge also recalls a sex discrimination lawsuit brought in 1976 by Alison Palmer, a retired foreign service officer, against the US Department of State. The case was settled, but only in 1989 and with an acknowledgment of past wrongs by the department. State had \u201cdisproportionately given men the good assignments\u201d, Palmer said. Yovanovitch writes: \u201cI felt \u2013 and still feel \u2013 tremendous gratitude to [her] for fighting for me and so many other women.\u201d Yovanovitch would serve in Moscow and as US ambassador to Kyrgyzstan, Armenia and Ukraine. She worked with political appointees and careerists. She offers particular praise for Republicans of an earlier, saner era. She lauds George Shultz, Ronald Reagan\u2019s secretary of state, for professionalism and commitment to country. Shultz reminded new ambassadors that \u201cmy\u201d country meant the US, not their place of posting. He also viewed diplomacy as a constant effort, as opposed to a spasmodic intervention. Yovanovitch also singles out James Baker, secretary of state to George HW Bush, for helping the president forge a coalition to win the Gulf war. \u201cDepartment folks found him cold and aloof,\u201d Yovanovitch recalls. \u201cBut it was clear immediately that he was a master of diplomacy.\u201d Baker showed flashes of idealism. The US stood for something. As younger men, both Shultz and Baker were marines. In marked contrast, Yovanovitch gives the Trump administration a thumping. She brands Rex Tillerson\u2019s 14-month tenure as secretary of state as \u201cnear-disastrous\u201d. As for Tillerson\u2019s successor, Mike Pompeo, Yovanovitch lambasts his \u201cfaux swagger\u201d and his refusal to defend her when she came under attack from Trump and his minions. Amid Trump\u2019s first impeachment, over Ukraine, Yovanovitch testified: \u201cThe policy process is visibly unravelling \u2026 the state department is being hollowed out.\u201d Loyalty to subordinates was not Pompeo\u2019s thing \u2013 or Trump\u2019s. \u201cLick what\u2019s above you, kick what\u2019s below you\u201d \u2013 that was more their mantra. True to form, in 2020 Pompeo screamed at a reporter: \u201cDo you think Americans give a fuck about Ukraine?\u201d Two years later, they do. At the same time, Pompeo nurses presidential ambitions. Good luck with that. Yovanovitch rightly places part of the blame for Putin\u2019s invasion on Trump. \u201cHe saw Ukraine as a pawn that could be bullied into doing his bidding,\u201d she said in a recent interview. \u201cI think that made a huge impact on Zelenskiy and I think that Putin and other bad actors around the world saw that our president was acting in his own personal interests.\u201d What comes next for the US, Ukraine and Russia? Pressure mounts on the Biden administration to do more for Ukraine \u2013 at the risk of nuclear conflict. Congressional Republicans vote against aid to Zelenskiy but demand a more robust US response. Recently, Trump admitted that he was \u201csurprised\u201d by Putin\u2019s \u201cspecial military operation\u201d. He \u201cthought he was negotiating\u201d, he said. A very stable genius, indeed.

They are wrong. Even before the tragedy of Ukraine, poll after poll showed that most people want to be kind and decent to those seeking refuge. But Johnson and Patel pay attention only to that minority who don\u2019t. And whip them up.</p> <p>In my own small town of Hastings, local refugee support groups have a strong presence, and collectively many thousands of followers on social media. When tiny boats crammed with desperate refugees arrived on our beaches a few months ago, there was an outpouring of support, including over \u00a334,000 collected in a few days in hundreds of donations by local people. The response to the people now fleeing the tragedy in Ukraine is similarly powerful. Over 1,260 have signed a petition to our MP urging her to oppose the nationality and borders bill and vote for the Lords\u2019 amendments which threw out so many of its iniquities. On the streets, in the pubs, the cafes, the churches, we find an empathy that far outweighs the repulsive narrative so mendaciously claimed as what \u201cthe British people want\u201d.</p> <p>A few days ago, a local fisherman told me that he had been instructed by Border Force to report any dinghies in the Channel but to let them drift. \u201cI\u2019m not doing that!\u201d he declared. \u201cOn sea, no matter who it is, no matter where they come from or why, everyone is my responsibility \u2013 let them drift? Hah!\u201d</p> <p>We are desperate to be listened to by our own parliamentary representative, a fellow party member with Patel and Johnson.

It is irritating to read that \u201cthe Jeremy Corbyn years (were) a disastrous period for the Labour party\u201d, with no qualification or analysis of whether that was actually the case.</p> <p>In 2017, Theresa May was expected to increase her majority; instead, Labour demolished it, winning over 40% of the vote for the first time in decades. Corbyn was able to communicate Labour\u2019s optimistic and transformative agenda precisely because so few figures in the mainstream press believed he was a serious contender.</p> <p>The result appeared to terrify liberal and conservative journalists alike, who spent the next two years recasting Corbyn as some sort of folk devil, even as Labour party membership rose to over 560,000 and its MPs enjoyed the fruits of their \u2013 temporarily \u2013 vastly increased majorities. Their efforts made a substantive contribution to the genuine disaster of the 2019 election.</p> <p>I was and remain agnostic about Corbyn himself, believing him to be temperamentally unsuited to the role of party leader.

The \u201cwest\u201d \u2013 including particularly the United States \u2013 erred the first time by failing to support Mikhail Gorbachev and thus enabling him to achieve a far more gentle and constructive breakup of the Soviet Union. The cataclysmic implosion it suffered fatally destroyed Gorbachev\u2019s credibility and contributed significantly to the estrangement of Russia from the west.</p> <p>Disastrously, the United States, abetted by other western governments, encouraged exploitative capitalism to feed off the fall of the Soviet Union and it was this that produced the oligarchs who quickly grasped the sale of state assets. The collapse of the rouble in 1998 was the final straw, not least as it caused increased poverty among millions of Russians. They blamed Gorbachev and his successor Boris Yeltsin and, instead of following democracy, they looked for a strong nationalist leader \u2013 and there was Putin waiting in the wings. Putin is very much the collateral damage of the west\u2019s mistakes. The Russian people rightly have great pride in their culture, much of which in its music, its opera, its ballet and even its literature, is European.

They are wrong. Even before the tragedy of Ukraine, poll after poll showed that most people want to be kind and decent to those seeking refuge. But Johnson and Patel pay attention only to that minority who don\u2019t. And whip them up. In my own small town of Hastings, local refugee support groups have a strong presence, and collectively many thousands of followers on social media. When tiny boats crammed with desperate refugees arrived on our beaches a few months ago, there was an outpouring of support, including over \u00a334,000 collected in a few days in hundreds of donations by local people. The response to the people now fleeing the tragedy in Ukraine is similarly powerful. Over 1,260 have signed a petition to our MP urging her to oppose the nationality and borders bill and vote for the Lords\u2019 amendments which threw out so many of its iniquities. On the streets, in the pubs, the cafes, the churches, we find an empathy that far outweighs the repulsive narrative so mendaciously claimed as what \u201cthe British people want\u201d. A few days ago, a local fisherman told me that he had been instructed by Border Force to report any dinghies in the Channel but to let them drift. \u201cI\u2019m not doing that!\u201d he declared. \u201cOn sea, no matter who it is, no matter where they come from or why, everyone is my responsibility \u2013 let them drift? Hah!\u201d We are desperate to be listened to by our own parliamentary representative, a fellow party member with Patel and Johnson. Patel and Johnson may lack any smidgen of the imaginative capacity needed to empathise with our fellow humans who are fleeing for their lives \u2013 but most of the rest of us are better than that. Felicity Laurence Hastings, East Sussex Why museums matter The headline of your article gave the impression that museums are failing to make any difference to the lives of pupils (\u201cWhy a day out at the museum won\u2019t result in better exam grades\u201d, News). Nothing could be further from the truth \u2013 museums across the UK worked hard throughout the pandemic to ensure that children had access to engaging experiences of culture, art, science and history. These experiences are not designed to help children pass specific exams, but to contribute to their wider development and understanding of the world. As your article recognises, there are numerous other recent studies that demonstrate the broader development and wellbeing benefits that museum visits can bring. Museums are brilliant places for discovering who we are, where we have come from and what we might become. There is no exam for that. Maria Balshaw, chair, National Museum Directors\u2019 Council; Sharon Heal, director, Museums Association; Andrew Lovett, chair, Association of Independent Museums; Jenny Waldman, director, Art Fund Reframing Corbyn \u2018disaster\u2019 I must take issue with the framing of some of Rachel Cooke\u2019s assertions and questions in her interview with Ed Miliband (the New Review). It is irritating to read that \u201cthe Jeremy Corbyn years (were) a disastrous period for the Labour party\u201d, with no qualification or analysis of whether that was actually the case. In 2017, Theresa May was expected to increase her majority; instead, Labour demolished it, winning over 40% of the vote for the first time in decades. Corbyn was able to communicate Labour\u2019s optimistic and transformative agenda precisely because so few figures in the mainstream press believed he was a serious contender. The result appeared to terrify liberal and conservative journalists alike, who spent the next two years recasting Corbyn as some sort of folk devil, even as Labour party membership rose to over 560,000 and its MPs enjoyed the fruits of their \u2013 temporarily \u2013 vastly increased majorities. Their efforts made a substantive contribution to the genuine disaster of the 2019 election. I was and remain agnostic about Corbyn himself, believing him to be temperamentally unsuited to the role of party leader. What his leadership represented, however, was something entirely different: a genuine belief in the capacities and capabilities of ordinary people, to which millions of voters responded in kind. If that\u2019s a disaster, I don\u2019t know what success is. Lynsey Hanley Liverpool Sustainability, not shiny toys While I agree with Will Hutton on the need for a swift transition to renewables, having spent the last 20 years working as an engineer in the space sector, I have my doubts that beaming microwave solar power to Earth from space can ever be part of the solution (\u201cWarmed-up Thatcherism was never going to be the answer. Now it would be a disaster\u201d, Comment). Can you imagine the planning process? How does \u201cResidents object to plans for death ray from the skies\u201d sound as a headline in the local paper? And that\u2019s before we get to energy security: what exactly will we do when a hostile power\u2019s satellite \u201caccidentally\u201d collides with our orbiting power station, and how to fix it when it goes wrong? But what is most frustrating is the unchallenged techno-utopianism underpinning much of the talk of net zero. We are constantly grasping for the next shiny toy, betting the farm (and our children\u2019s futures) on the off-chance that yet more marginal gains and elaborate schemes will keep pace with our ever-growing appetites. Where in all this is the discussion of reducing demand, or an honest appraisal of how to live sustainably on a single planet with finite resources too much for us to face? Kevin Middleton Stanford in the Vale, Faringdon, Berkshire Don\u2019t focus on phones It is astonishing to see the chair of the social mobility commission, Katharine Birbalsingh, claim \u201cit all starts with smartphones\u201d (\u201cTake away children\u2019s phones to boost social mobility\u201d, News). The past decade has seen the devastation of Sure Start children\u2019s centres, a squeeze on education spending that has hit the most disadvantaged areas hardest, and steep cuts to social security benefits that have increased child poverty. Each of these factors will have damaged social mobility. Focusing on smartphones falls into a long tradition of blaming individual behaviour to distract attention from deep structural inequalities. The commission is supposed to hold government to account on its actions. It is not hard to see why Birbalsingh was the government\u2019s choice as chair. Dr Kitty Stewart Associate professor, Department of Social Policy, Associate Director, Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion, London School of Economics and Political Science, London WC2 All Russians are not Putin Hans Kundnani\u2019s article makes the crucial distinction between Vladimir Putin and the Russian people (\u201cFirst, we did too little to oppose Russia. Now do we risk going too far the other way?\u201d, Comment). We must not make the mistake a second time of failing to respect and work with the Russian people after Putin\u2019s inevitable fall. The \u201cwest\u201d \u2013 including particularly the United States \u2013 erred the first time by failing to support Mikhail Gorbachev and thus enabling him to achieve a far more gentle and constructive breakup of the Soviet Union. The cataclysmic implosion it suffered fatally destroyed Gorbachev\u2019s credibility and contributed significantly to the estrangement of Russia from the west. Disastrously, the United States, abetted by other western governments, encouraged exploitative capitalism to feed off the fall of the Soviet Union and it was this that produced the oligarchs who quickly grasped the sale of state assets. The collapse of the rouble in 1998 was the final straw, not least as it caused increased poverty among millions of Russians. They blamed Gorbachev and his successor Boris Yeltsin and, instead of following democracy, they looked for a strong nationalist leader \u2013 and there was Putin waiting in the wings. Putin is very much the collateral damage of the west\u2019s mistakes. The Russian people rightly have great pride in their culture, much of which in its music, its opera, its ballet and even its literature, is European. We must constantly make the point that we also recognise Russian culture and draw Russia after Putin into a closer relationship. Michael Meadowcroft Leeds Your news article states that \u201cRussians over 65 are 51% more likely to watch television than under-25s\u201d (\u201cMoscow\u2019s family divide\u201d). This still leaves 49% of over-65s who aren\u2019t more likely to watch television, and not all of the 51% are swallowing the propaganda. Russian blogger Ilya Krasilshchik\u2019s 110,000 followers does not constitute a major proportional ratio of a vast country to endorse the impression in your article that older Russians are pro-war in the Ukraine. Is it the over-65s who massacre, mutilate and rape civilians in war? Liana Marletta Glasgow",

      "body": "<p>Ukraine has been an independent country for more than half Vladimir Putin\u2019s adult life (he turns 70 this year). It\u2019s been a free republic for more than 30 years, long enough for the first generation of Ukrainians born since independence to have school-age children of their own. It\u2019s had seven different leaders, all of them still alive.</p> <p>It would be sentimental \u2013 and patronising \u2013 to talk about a country having \u201cgrown up\u201d. But 30 years is long enough for countries to change, for better or for worse; long enough for countries to have eras. Ukraine was well into its second era, its European era, when Putin invaded last month. Putin never accepted the right of post-Soviet Ukraine to exist in independent Ukraine\u2019s first era. In terms of understanding the country, that\u2019s the period he\u2019s stuck in; Putin doesn\u2019t acknowledge that a second era began.</p> <p>The west shares many of the Kremlin\u2019s misapprehensions about Ukraine. We are still too ready to see the country through the cliche of a \u201cnationalist, Ukrainian-speaking\u201d west and a \u201cRussia-friendly, Russian-speaking\u201d south and east. Or, more crudely and colourfully, neo-communist miners in the east, neo-Nazis in the west. Of course it was never that simple, even in post-Soviet Ukraine. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2022/mar/09/history-brutally-back-ukraine-europes-appetite-nuclear-superpower\" title=\"\">European-era Ukraine</a>, which emerged in 2014, overturned its own political fundamentals. Faced with an existential struggle against a powerful, ruthless neighbour, Russia, where nationalism now serves autocracy, an emergent class of Ukrainian liberals made common cause with Ukrainian nationalists. It\u2019s been an uncomfortable alliance but it has kept the country together. As Ukraine defends itself against Putin\u2019s terror campaign, mutually estranged liberals and nationalists in other countries \u2013 the US, England, France \u2013 would do well to watch.</p> <p>To talk about \u201cEuropean Ukraine\u201d isn\u2019t to describe an achieved state but a state of hope: hope of membership in the European Union \u2013 more meaningful to Ukraine, at least until Russia attacked, than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/06/ukraine-pressures-nato-for-membership-as-russia-amasses-troops-at-border\" title=\"\">membership of Nato</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1250e853dd43ded9d4e7ea63b99bde9ca84a6bb6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1250e853dd43ded9d4e7ea63b99bde9ca84a6bb6/0_57_1019_611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Clinton, Boris Yeltsin and Ukraine\u2019s Leonid Kravchuk after signing a nuclear disarmament agreement in the Kremlin in 1994.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Clinton, Boris Yeltsin and Ukraine\u2019s Leonid Kravchuk after signing a nuclear disarmament agreement in the Kremlin in 1994.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergei Supinsky/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ukraine\u2019s hope of Europe had its material side, a hope of grants, jobs and trade. Since the \u201crevolution of dignity\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/21/-sp-ukraine-maidan-protest-kiev\" title=\"\">also known as \u201cMaidan\u201d</a> \u2013 in 2014, trade with the EU soared while trade with Russia plunged. More than a million Ukrainians went to work, legally or otherwise, in the EU. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, much has been made in Britain of the EU\u2019s openness to Ukrainian refugees compared with the barriers put up by London. But it\u2019s a depressing reflection of how mainstream anti-immigrant assumptions have become in the UK that virtually no one in Britain is aware the EU gave Ukrainians visa-free access years ago, as a reward for their country\u2019s sacrifices in Europe\u2019s name. Since 2017, as a result of that and of Brexit, Ukrainians have levelled up and Britons levelled down to identical rights of EU entry: 90 days\u2019 stay without a visa.</p> <p>Beyond the material hopes of European-era Ukraine, there is the prospect, less tangible and more powerful, of an alternative form of nationhood. Rather than the archaic, romantic, racial mystifications of old Ukrainian nationalism, or Putin\u2019s neo-imperial vision of Ukraine pulverised and remade as a puppet state to serve Russian nationalism, it\u2019s of Ukraine pursuing its free course as an equal member of a self-constraining, self-governing association of countries, the EU.</p> <p>The beauty of the EU, for Ukraine, is the capaciousness of its model for both liberals and nationalists. In some ways, the aims of European-era Ukraine closely resemble those of the Scottish National party and the Irish republic: to use the economic power of the EU to leverage their own, to break out of the orbit of a delusional post-imperial culture, to find national self-determination by accepting multinational rules. As Tom Nairn wrote of Scotland, a country could aspire to \u201ca new interdependence where our nationhood will count, rather than towards mere isolation\u201d.</p> <p>For Ukraine\u2019s more conservative nationalists, it\u2019s Poland and Hungary that offer the more appealing EU models \u2013 stridently patriotic, subordinating media, courts and education to national ideals and social conservatism, all while getting subsidies and trading freely within the EU.</p> <p>The prelude to Ukraine\u2019s European era occurred in 2013 under president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/25/ukraine-ex-president-viktor-yanukovych-found-guilty-of-treason\" title=\"\">Viktor Yanukovych</a>, a profoundly corrupt politician from the east of the country. Although seen as a proxy for Kremlin interests, and generally loyal to the idea of post-Soviet Ukraine as a Russian client state, he threw his weight behind an association agreement with the EU. He had his country on side, but Putin gave it to be understood that he considered it a betrayal \u2013 Ukraine could partner with the EU or Russia, not both.</p> <p>Whether Yanukovych was genuinely up for the deal with Brussels, or simply angling for a bigger bung from Moscow, he changed his mind at the last minute, took a large loan from Putin and turned his back on the EU.</p> <p>It was November. Protests began in Kyiv against abandonment of the EU deal. There were calls for Yanukovych to resign. Small, peaceful protests were put down violently by the police. Parliament, then controlled by Yanukovych allies, passed repressive laws against free speech and gatherings. As 2013 passed into 2014, the protests grew, their demands expanded and their base spread. Opposition to Yanukovych and calls for deeper ties to Europe evolved into attacks on the entire corrupt, oligarchic system of business and government.</p> <p>Young members of the liberal intelligentsia were joined by radical nationalist groups, by small-business owners and by factory workers. Opposition MPs aligned themselves with the protesters. Increasingly violent street battles were waged around Kyiv\u2019s central square, Maidan Nezalezhnosti. Barricades went up. Weapons escalated from clubs and stones and shields to molotov cocktails, to stun grenades and rubber bullets, to actual bullets. Some police were shot; more than 100 protesters were killed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5696ec279b016060e2c0cb8f7e41dbf3db1ca28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5696ec279b016060e2c0cb8f7e41dbf3db1ca28/0_331_5000_3002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protester in 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In 2014, protests erupted in Kyiv\u2019s Maidan Square over the government\u2019s withdrawal from EU talks.

European foreign ministers brokered a peace deal with Yanukovych, the Maidan crowd refused to accept it, and Yanukovych fled the country. Parliament voted in an interim government and prepared for new elections.</p> <p>Barely had the revolutionaries\u2019 victory sunk in before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/18/putin-confirms-annexation-crimea-ukrainian-soldier-casualty\" title=\"\">Russia annexed Crimea</a> in a nearly bloodless <em>coup de main</em>. In Yanukovych\u2019s home region of Donbas, on the border with Russia, locals angry at the treatment of their lawfully elected president seized administrative buildings. They were quickly ousted, only to be replaced, in April, by a new wave of rebels helped by volunteers from Russia. Fighting escalated to a full-scale war, culminating in incursions by regular Russian troops. Thousands of people were killed. By 2015, the front lines had stabilised and fighting lessened, with part of Donbas under joint Russian-rebel control. The rest of Ukraine was at peace. In 2017, the association agreement with the EU came into force.</p> <p>Even before the war in the Donbas began, there were warnings of what the longer term held. In what reads now as an astonishingly accurate forecast of what was to come, in an interview with a Ukrainian paper in March 2014, the former Putin adviser Andrei Illarionov spelled it out, failing only to predict that eight years would pass first. \u201cThere\u2019s an aim and a plan to attack Ukraine which was put together years ago,\u201d he said. It has many different elements \u2026 Crimea, the south-east and, of course, a change of power in Kyiv. And then there are other things: a new [Ukrainian] constitution, to be written in the Kremlin, disarmament of the Ukrainian people, liquidation of Maidan, and so on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLiquidation of Maidan\u201d sounds different from the current Kremlin programme, until you realise this is simply \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/vladimir-putin-ukraine-attack-antisemitism-denazify\" title=\"\">denazification</a>\u201d by another name.</p> <p><strong>* * *</strong></p> <p>It might seem trivial now, when Ukraine is on fire and hundreds are being killed every day, when all that seems important is how many Russian tanks and planes and soldiers the Ukrainians have to blow up to make Putin stop, to talk about abstractions like nationalism and liberalism. And yet without these forces coming together over the past seven years of semi-peace, would Ukraine have held out this long?</p> <p>I remember being surprised, when I visited Kyiv at the end of February 2014, to see how focused liberals and nationalists alike were on a European future. The spokesman for one of the most notorious radical nationalist groups, Right Sector, talked to me about Poland as a model for the country. European flags were everywhere. I went for dinner one evening with a friend of a friend, a successful businesswoman. The Maidan was very localised; a huge encampment of brown tents crowded together, wreathed in the smoke of hundreds of stoves, in which exhausted people, who had fought nightly battles in freezing conditions, lived difficult lives away from home. But right next door to it were expensive restaurants with waiters in spotless white shirts serving fine wines and tuna carpaccio. \u201cYou know, the nationalists were very important,\u201d said the businesswoman, sipping her grenache. \u201cThey did very good work at the leading edge.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve always been in two minds about that conversation with someone who had been very kind to me. On the one hand, it had that air of somebody being grateful that somebody else was doing their dirty work; that one person had education, good taste and proper gentle sentiments, and they were grateful that their interests were being protected by another person who risked their life with a petrol bomb and a brick, and whose most conservative, chauvinist views the first person would definitely not want to hear at their dinner table in peacetime. On the other hand, my friend\u2019s friend was being honest about the realities of a dangerous situation, and resistance towards a nasty, increasingly repressive regime: that she was not one of nature\u2019s fighters, and she was glad to have people prepared to fight for their country on her side. \u201cNationalist\u201d and \u201cliberal\u201d, after all, are words with an extremely broad range of meanings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d56ed23530dd36a2ac410bd207722671c3fff96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d56ed23530dd36a2ac410bd207722671c3fff96/482_283_2815_1690/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg meet in Kyiv as Ukraine decides to pursue Nato as well as EU membership.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg meet in Kyiv as Ukraine decides to pursue Nato as well as EU membership.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergei Chuzavkov/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFor me, \u2018national\u2019 is what allows me to defend Ukraine as an independent, sovereign nation,\u201d said the Ukrainian philosopher Evhen Bistritsky in 2018, at a time when disillusionment with Ukraine\u2019s post-Maidan failures to get to grips with corruption and institutional inertia was running deep.</p> <p>\u201cI am a liberal, defending the independence of Ukraine. Part of Ukrainian society supports conservative values, linking them to security. If we\u2019re really only going to preach universal, classical, liberal values \u2026 we promote discord in the country.\u201d</p> <p>In a country not fighting for its existence, in the US, perhaps, or Britain, or France, in some safe part of the EU, such language would have marked Bistritsky out as a centrist, a moderate, even, more pejoratively, an undemocratic compromiser. In the present Ukrainian context, faced with the Russian killing machine, \u201cdiscord\u201d becomes \u201cfailure to fill the ranks\u201d.</p> <p>Recently the Ukrainian writer Artem Chekh published <em>Absolute Zero</em>, his memoir of service in the Ukrainian army on the Donbas front in 2015. In it he faces up to the strangeness of being a liberal, cosmopolitan, intellectual man serving alongside workers and farmers who see the world in patriotic, if cynical, absolutes. I went around to his flat in Kyiv a few weeks ago for coffee and cake. Now he has taken up a gun again to protect the city against the invader. <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2022/march/in-kyiv\" title=\"\">In an article</a> for the <em>London Review of Books </em>blog, he lists his comrades: \u201ca music producer, an owner of a household chemicals store, a teacher, an artist, a bank clerk, a former investigator, a doctor. The ability to write, paint, act, play a musical instrument or dance doesn\u2019t matter now. What counts is military experience.\u201d</p>",

Or, more crudely and colourfully, neo-communist miners in the east, neo-Nazis in the west. Of course it was never that simple, even in post-Soviet Ukraine. But European-era Ukraine, which emerged in 2014, overturned its own political fundamentals. Faced with an existential struggle against a powerful, ruthless neighbour, Russia, where nationalism now serves autocracy, an emergent class of Ukrainian liberals made common cause with Ukrainian nationalists. It\u2019s been an uncomfortable alliance but it has kept the country together. As Ukraine defends itself against Putin\u2019s terror campaign, mutually estranged liberals and nationalists in other countries \u2013 the US, England, France \u2013 would do well to watch. To talk about \u201cEuropean Ukraine\u201d isn\u2019t to describe an achieved state but a state of hope: hope of membership in the European Union \u2013 more meaningful to Ukraine, at least until Russia attacked, than membership of Nato. Ukraine\u2019s hope of Europe had its material side, a hope of grants, jobs and trade. Since the \u201crevolution of dignity\u201d \u2013 also known as \u201cMaidan\u201d \u2013 in 2014, trade with the EU soared while trade with Russia plunged. More than a million Ukrainians went to work, legally or otherwise, in the EU. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, much has been made in Britain of the EU\u2019s openness to Ukrainian refugees compared with the barriers put up by London. But it\u2019s a depressing reflection of how mainstream anti-immigrant assumptions have become in the UK that virtually no one in Britain is aware the EU gave Ukrainians visa-free access years ago, as a reward for their country\u2019s sacrifices in Europe\u2019s name. Since 2017, as a result of that and of Brexit, Ukrainians have levelled up and Britons levelled down to identical rights of EU entry: 90 days\u2019 stay without a visa. Beyond the material hopes of European-era Ukraine, there is the prospect, less tangible and more powerful, of an alternative form of nationhood. Rather than the archaic, romantic, racial mystifications of old Ukrainian nationalism, or Putin\u2019s neo-imperial vision of Ukraine pulverised and remade as a puppet state to serve Russian nationalism, it\u2019s of Ukraine pursuing its free course as an equal member of a self-constraining, self-governing association of countries, the EU. The beauty of the EU, for Ukraine, is the capaciousness of its model for both liberals and nationalists. In some ways, the aims of European-era Ukraine closely resemble those of the Scottish National party and the Irish republic: to use the economic power of the EU to leverage their own, to break out of the orbit of a delusional post-imperial culture, to find national self-determination by accepting multinational rules. As Tom Nairn wrote of Scotland, a country could aspire to \u201ca new interdependence where our nationhood will count, rather than towards mere isolation\u201d. For Ukraine\u2019s more conservative nationalists, it\u2019s Poland and Hungary that offer the more appealing EU models \u2013 stridently patriotic, subordinating media, courts and education to national ideals and social conservatism, all while getting subsidies and trading freely within the EU. The prelude to Ukraine\u2019s European era occurred in 2013 under president Viktor Yanukovych, a profoundly corrupt politician from the east of the country. Although seen as a proxy for Kremlin interests, and generally loyal to the idea of post-Soviet Ukraine as a Russian client state, he threw his weight behind an association agreement with the EU. He had his country on side, but Putin gave it to be understood that he considered it a betrayal \u2013 Ukraine could partner with the EU or Russia, not both. Whether Yanukovych was genuinely up for the deal with Brussels, or simply angling for a bigger bung from Moscow, he changed his mind at the last minute, took a large loan from Putin and turned his back on the EU. It was November. Protests began in Kyiv against abandonment of the EU deal. There were calls for Yanukovych to resign. Small, peaceful protests were put down violently by the police. Parliament, then controlled by Yanukovych allies, passed repressive laws against free speech and gatherings. As 2013 passed into 2014, the protests grew, their demands expanded and their base spread. Opposition to Yanukovych and calls for deeper ties to Europe evolved into attacks on the entire corrupt, oligarchic system of business and government. Young members of the liberal intelligentsia were joined by radical nationalist groups, by small-business owners and by factory workers. Opposition MPs aligned themselves with the protesters. Increasingly violent street battles were waged around Kyiv\u2019s central square, Maidan Nezalezhnosti. Barricades went up. Weapons escalated from clubs and stones and shields to molotov cocktails, to stun grenades and rubber bullets, to actual bullets. Some police were shot; more than 100 protesters were killed. In the third week of February, for reasons still mysterious \u2013 perhaps because the security forces ceased to believe in the president \u2013 the regime collapsed. European foreign ministers brokered a peace deal with Yanukovych, the Maidan crowd refused to accept it, and Yanukovych fled the country. Parliament voted in an interim government and prepared for new elections. Barely had the revolutionaries\u2019 victory sunk in before Russia annexed Crimea in a nearly bloodless coup de main. In Yanukovych\u2019s home region of Donbas, on the border with Russia, locals angry at the treatment of their lawfully elected president seized administrative buildings. They were quickly ousted, only to be replaced, in April, by a new wave of rebels helped by volunteers from Russia. Fighting escalated to a full-scale war, culminating in incursions by regular Russian troops. Thousands of people were killed. By 2015, the front lines had stabilised and fighting lessened, with part of Donbas under joint Russian-rebel control. The rest of Ukraine was at peace. In 2017, the association agreement with the EU came into force. Even before the war in the Donbas began, there were warnings of what the longer term held. In what reads now as an astonishingly accurate forecast of what was to come, in an interview with a Ukrainian paper in March 2014, the former Putin adviser Andrei Illarionov spelled it out, failing only to predict that eight years would pass first. \u201cThere\u2019s an aim and a plan to attack Ukraine which was put together years ago,\u201d he said. It has many different elements \u2026 Crimea, the south-east and, of course, a change of power in Kyiv. And then there are other things: a new [Ukrainian] constitution, to be written in the Kremlin, disarmament of the Ukrainian people, liquidation of Maidan, and so on.\u201d \u201cLiquidation of Maidan\u201d sounds different from the current Kremlin programme, until you realise this is simply \u201cdenazification\u201d by another name. * * * It might seem trivial now, when Ukraine is on fire and hundreds are being killed every day, when all that seems important is how many Russian tanks and planes and soldiers the Ukrainians have to blow up to make Putin stop, to talk about abstractions like nationalism and liberalism. And yet without these forces coming together over the past seven years of semi-peace, would Ukraine have held out this long? I remember being surprised, when I visited Kyiv at the end of February 2014, to see how focused liberals and nationalists alike were on a European future. The spokesman for one of the most notorious radical nationalist groups, Right Sector, talked to me about Poland as a model for the country. European flags were everywhere. I went for dinner one evening with a friend of a friend, a successful businesswoman. The Maidan was very localised; a huge encampment of brown tents crowded together, wreathed in the smoke of hundreds of stoves, in which exhausted people, who had fought nightly battles in freezing conditions, lived difficult lives away from home. But right next door to it were expensive restaurants with waiters in spotless white shirts serving fine wines and tuna carpaccio. \u201cYou know, the nationalists were very important,\u201d said the businesswoman, sipping her grenache. \u201cThey did very good work at the leading edge.\u201d I\u2019ve always been in two minds about that conversation with someone who had been very kind to me. On the one hand, it had that air of somebody being grateful that somebody else was doing their dirty work; that one person had education, good taste and proper gentle sentiments, and they were grateful that their interests were being protected by another person who risked their life with a petrol bomb and a brick, and whose most conservative, chauvinist views the first person would definitely not want to hear at their dinner table in peacetime. On the other hand, my friend\u2019s friend was being honest about the realities of a dangerous situation, and resistance towards a nasty, increasingly repressive regime: that she was not one of nature\u2019s fighters, and she was glad to have people prepared to fight for their country on her side. \u201cNationalist\u201d and \u201cliberal\u201d, after all, are words with an extremely broad range of meanings. \u201cFor me, \u2018national\u2019 is what allows me to defend Ukraine as an independent, sovereign nation,\u201d said the Ukrainian philosopher Evhen Bistritsky in 2018, at a time when disillusionment with Ukraine\u2019s post-Maidan failures to get to grips with corruption and institutional inertia was running deep. \u201cI am a liberal, defending the independence of Ukraine. Part of Ukrainian society supports conservative values, linking them to security. If we\u2019re really only going to preach universal, classical, liberal values \u2026 we promote discord in the country.\u201d In a country not fighting for its existence, in the US, perhaps, or Britain, or France, in some safe part of the EU, such language would have marked Bistritsky out as a centrist, a moderate, even, more pejoratively, an undemocratic compromiser. In the present Ukrainian context, faced with the Russian killing machine, \u201cdiscord\u201d becomes \u201cfailure to fill the ranks\u201d. Recently the Ukrainian writer Artem Chekh published Absolute Zero, his memoir of service in the Ukrainian army on the Donbas front in 2015. In it he faces up to the strangeness of being a liberal, cosmopolitan, intellectual man serving alongside workers and farmers who see the world in patriotic, if cynical, absolutes. I went around to his flat in Kyiv a few weeks ago for coffee and cake. Now he has taken up a gun again to protect the city against the invader. In an article for the London Review of Books blog, he lists his comrades: \u201ca music producer, an owner of a household chemicals store, a teacher, an artist, a bank clerk, a former investigator, a doctor. The ability to write, paint, act, play a musical instrument or dance doesn\u2019t matter now. What counts is military experience.\u201d",

In response England were in command at 176-4 and Nat Sciver set at the crease, they then lost five wickets for 23 runs. Cue frayed nerves and a good old peer down the barrel of a World Cup exit. </p> <p>They creaked over the line with one wicket to spare and will face bottom of the table Pakistan at the Hagley Oval in Christchurch on Thursday for another MUST WIN game.

Brunt and Shrubsole struggled at the start, but good captaincy from Knight saved the innings. Rather than push her senior bowlers through, she took a chance on Cross - paired with the experienced Sciver - and it paid off in a big way, with the scoring drying up immediately. Then it was Ecclestone and Dean who were so economical, but also took some very key wickets and really pushed NZ into the danger zone. The loss of Devine to injury was unfortunate for NZ, as if she had been able to bat on, it may have been a different story. She is such a talismanic captain and can really shape an innings. She didn\u2019t look quite right when she came back and wasn\u2019t able to continue her momentum. Maddy Green was solid, but not sensational and Jess Kerr\u2019s late hitting looked like it could do some damage, but it was too little, too late. This doesn\u2019t look like enough runs on what we saw yesterday was a good batting wicket, but anything could happen from here. NZ are desperate to stay alive in this tournament and maybe they can pull off a miracle with the ball? Stay tuned, because it\u2019s certain to be a fascinating second innings. I\u2019ll hand you over now to the excellent James Wallace, who will take you through England\u2019s batting innings.

Brunt\u2019s next ball is a touch too full and Green drives it well, but there\u2019s a fielder on the boundary to restrict her to one.

New Zealand have looked excellent at times, but close losses to South Africa and West Indies, as well as comprehensive defeat at the hands of Australia have derailed the hosts.

      "bodyText": "Hare\u2019s breadth. Skin of teeth. Eye of... Shrubsole? England squeak through at the last, the experienced campaigner Anya Shrubsole seeing them over the line with the bat (this time) after it looked like New Zealand were going to pull off a very damp heist in Auckland. Both sides were far from perfect, after a solid start that saw them reach 96-1 New Zealand were disappointed to end up bowled out with an over to spare, having crawled to 203. In response England were in command at 176-4 and Nat Sciver set at the crease, they then lost five wickets for 23 runs. Cue frayed nerves and a good old peer down the barrel of a World Cup exit. They creaked over the line with one wicket to spare and will face bottom of the table Pakistan at the Hagley Oval in Christchurch on Thursday for another MUST WIN game. They don\u2019t make it easy for themselves, or us for that matter. That\u2019s it from me, thanks for your company and goodnight/morning/whatever it is. Bye! England captain Heather Knight was visibly relieved, blowing out her cheeks she said it was, \u201cAmazing to get this win... but credit to the Kiwis, they fought so hard. Today was all about the win and luckily we did that. \u201cIt was nice to get over the line, the bowlers were outstanding, but we have to be better and one of the top order has to go on and do the job... \u201cThere is a bit of relief, we will reflect on what we can do better and we can make it easier but the main thing was getting the win. \u201cWe are building quite nicely and players are performing well, Kate Cross was outstanding, Nat Sciver and the spinners were good. It still has not clicked but hopefully that is to come, and we have two massive must-win games to come.\u201d Losing (and injured) New Zealand captain Sophie Devine was rueful, \u201cThe girls are gutted but that\u2019s cricket. We lost 3 games by 2-3 wickets or a couple of runs here and there... we have one more game left and we will get up for for it as it will be our last opportunity to make New Zealand proud.\u201d They can be proud of the way they battled back into this match, especially given the injury blows to Devine and Lea Tahuhu - who limped off after just a 4.4 overs but not before she bowled Tammy Beaumont to notch up her 93rd ODI wicket and become New Zealand\u2019s leading ODI wicket taker. Nat Sciver is POTM and is in \u201cshock!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s crazy we got over the line when we probably should not have. I am in shock, there have been so many close games in this tournament. I knew I had to do most of the scoring and stay out there for a long time. It was tough bowling in the windy conditions, and a difficult wicket to find consistency.\u201d One way to put it. Still a win\u2019s a win. (It is!) What happened there then? England were cruising and then went to pieces. Hard luck New Zealand, they did extremely well to push them to the wire. Tears and relief for England, they\u2019ve been through the ringer in the last half an hour. They march stumble on in this World Cup. Shrubsole gets it away for a single and England win! If a wicket falls now it\u2019s a SUPER OVER. England v New Zealand. In a World Cup! Halliday is on to bowl. Shrubsole drives her for four!! SCORES ARE LEVEL 47th over: England 199-9 (Dean 0, Shrubsole 2) Shrubsole digs out two full balls and then squeezes away a single. 21 year old Charlie Dean on strike. Mackay slides one down the leg side for a freebie wide. 5 needed off 18 balls for England. New Zealand need ONE wicket. 46th over: England 197-9 (Dean 0, Shrubsole 1) Anya Shrubsole and Charlie Dean are England\u2019s last hope. Both sides have two reviews left. Shrubsole takes a single to keep strike. BRUNT IS RUN OUT! England have collapsed from 175-4 to 195-9! Brunt pulls one into the leg side and they run one but some mad running leaves her diving full length trying to get back into her ground... but she\u2019s well short! New Zealand jsut need one more! England need 8 runs. Breathe! 45th over: England 194-8 (Brunt 4, Dean 0) Two wickets for the over for Mackay, she\u2019s bowled her side back into contention. Who is going to hold their nerve?! Great to watch. Tension in spades. Skidding on and three reds mean Cross has to go! Another close finish here! 2 wickets needed for New Zealand - 10 runs for England. Drag on! New Zealand have another! They need three more, England need 12 runs. 44th over: England 191-6 (Brunt 4, Ecclestone 0) A wicket maiden for Jess Kerr and she very nearly has another! A length ball zips off the seam and beats everything to skuttle away for four! Cripes. The rain falls and the balls skids on, Sciver missing a cut shot and the zinger bails light up the gloom. A fantastic innings but New Zealand still have a sniff. 43rd over: England 187-5 (Sciver 61, Brunt 4) Sciver is cool and collected, working the ball around and happy to take the singles. Brunt is slightly more skittish, a sweep is top edged over the keeper, lands safe and takes England one run closer. 17 needed off 42 balls. 42nd over: England 182-5 (Sciver 59, Brunt 1) Sciver works Rowe away for three with a clip through mid-wicket and Brunt gets off the mark with a jab to point. A twist?! Dunkley plays down the wrong line and is castled. She played well for her 33. Still a bit to do for England. 28 needed off 54 balls. New Zealand need to take five very quick wickets. 41st over: England 176-5 (Sciver 55, Brunt 0) 40th over: England 173-4 (Sciver 53, Dunkley 32) Fifty for Nat Sciver! Her slowest ODI fifty, off 92 balls, but one of her most important. She latches onto a short ball from Rowe and swivel-pulls it away to the fence. She\u2019s keeping England in this World Cup. 39th over: England 166-4 (Sciver 47, Dunkley 31) Three runs off Frances Mackay with little risk. New Zealand need to break this partnership. England are well ahead of the Duckworth Lewis of they do go off for rain, right now it looks like the ground staff aren\u2019t too fussed and the players are stopping out there. 38th over: England 163-4 (Sciver 45, Dunkley 30) A bit dark and gloomy in Auckland. Spatters of rain landing on the camera lens. Hanna Rowe is back on to bowl, she has four overs in the can. A bouncer is deemed too short and given as a wide. The lissom bowler then serves up another short ball and Dunkley leans back and crunches it away through point for four. Dunkley has been impressive here, busy, rotating strike and putting the bad ball away. 37th over: England 157-4 (Sciver 44, Dunkley 26) Fifty partnership between Sciver and Dunkley. They\u2019ve done really well here to calm the nerves and eke England closer. 47 needed from 78 balls for England. 36th over: England 153-4 (Sciver 43, Dunkley 23) Amelia Kerr into her final over. She drops short with her first ball and Sciver cross-bats for four. A couple of singles off the rest of the over means Kerr finishes with 0-41 from her 10. 35th over: England 147-4 (Sciver 38, Dunkley 22) On we go. 15 overs left. 34th over: England 143-4 (Sciver 36, Dunkley 21) Kerrs on at both ends. Amelia keeps it tight with just a couple coming off her over. Beat that, sis. 61 needed off 96 balls for England. Six scalps for New Zealand. 33rd over: England 141-4 (Sciver 36, Dunkley 19) Sciver steps away to give herself room and slots Jess Kerr over wide mid-off to pick up four. She\u2019s doing her best to give Greenway her wish... but almost gives it away off the final ball - a mistimed flick resulting in a leading edge that loops into the air for what seems like an age but there isn\u2019t a fielder close enough to swoop in for the catch. 32nd over: England 137-4 (Sciver 32, Dunkley 19) The excellent Lydia Greenway on commentary wants England to chase this down in a clinical way rather than spluttering over the line... or succumbing to the pressure of the tournament situation. This feels like the crucial partnership for both sides. Jess Kerr is coming into the attack from the other end. 31st over: England 134-4 (Sciver 30, Dunkley 18) Fantastic over for England as Sciver launches Halliday over mid-on for four. A single brings Dunkley on strike and she climbs into the final ball before drinks - smearing it straight for a 72 metre SIX! 30th over: England 123-4 (Sciver 25, Dunkley 12) Kerr offers Dunkley too much width and she accepts with a thudding cut shot for four runs. A wide down the leg side is followed by an inside edge that squirts away fine and the batters come back for a couple. 20 overs to go. This feels edgy. A fox has started making horrible noises right outside my window. A sign? An omen? Of what? Dunno. 29th over: England 116-4 (Sciver 25, Dunkley 6) Halliday hops in for another and there\u2019s just a couple off it. England need 88 runs from 126 balls. New Zealand need six wickets. 28th over: England 114-4 (Sciver 24, Dunkley 5) A risky paddle sees Dunkley get off the mark, she then goes hard at a full ball and gets it through the field to pick up four. England pick up eight runs from the over, can these two batters get them close? Feels like we could be, yep. 27th over: England 106-4 (Sciver 22, Dunkley 0) Brooke Halliday it was who got the breakthrough, whirling away in all her wrong-footed delightfulness. She sends down a wicket-maiden. An inspired bowling change. Sophia Dunkley is the new batter. Poor shot from Jones. She limply pulls a full toss straight to short mid-wicket. Game on! 26th over: England 106-3 (Sciver 22, Jones 1) Kerr with a maiden. 25th over: England 106-3 (Sciver 22, Jones 1) Here\u2019s Nat Sciver! A full toss by Mackay is bunted away for four, Sciver\u2019s first real shot in anger. The camera zooms in on her and she looks steely eyed and determined. England need her here. Ton up for the holders after half the overs. 24th over: England 99-3 (Sciver 16, Jones 0) Amelia Kerr keeps the pressure on. Just a single to Nat Sciver, who has been pretty subdued so far in this innings. Amy Jones is the new bat and pats a few back, all the better to get her eye in. And they do! Heather Knight gets out the reverse sweep once more but misses. Huge appeal and the finger is raised! Knight reviews... is this sliding down? Nope! Ball tracking shows the ball clipping the leg bail - Knight has to go. New Zealand prise the door ajar. 23rd over: England 98-3 (Sciver 15, Jones 0) 22nd over: England 93-2 (Knight 41, Sciver 14) A better over from Kerr, three from the over. New Zealand need to make something happen here. 21st over: England 93-2 (Knight 40, Sciver 13) Confirmation that Lea Tahuhu will not come back onto the field following her hamstring injury. We wish her well. 20th over: England 90-2 (Knight 39, Sciver 11) Amelia Kerr is on for a twirl but she isn\u2019t quite finding her line and length. She\u2019s either too far outside off or sliding into the pads to be worked away. Knight does exactly that off the final ball of the over, glancing away to bring up a boundary. It\u2019s gone a little flat out there for the White Ferns. 18th over: England 83-2 (Knight 34, Sciver 9) Reverse sweep for four off the final ball of the over. Pre-meditated by Knight and played with aplomb. Showing all her class here the England skipper. 17th over: England 77-2 (Knight 29, Sciver 8) Tickin\u2019 over. 16th over: England 73-2 (Knight 27, Sciver 6) England pick up seven runs from Rowe to stay ahead of the run rate. They are currently ticking along at 4.29 with the RR at 3.96. They need 131 from 33 overs to keep their World Cup campaign alive. 15th over: England 66-2 (Knight 22, Sciver 5) Oh no! It looks like Lea Tahuhu has tweaked a hamstring, she pulls up lame after four balls of the over and has to limp off the field with the kiwi physio. Brooke Halliday comes on to complete the over, leaping in as she does, Mike Procter-ish, off the wrong foot. And she nearly has a wicket off her second ball! Nat Sciver plinks a drive in the air to a diving Maddy Green who signals straight away that the ball bounced into her hands. Well played all-round-perhaps apart from Sciver. 14th over: England 65-2 (Knight 21, Sciver 5) A huge appeal for lbw but it is one that peters out into a groan as the New Zealand players realise that Nat Sciver has inside edged into her pad, her bacon duly saved. Drinks. Just time to have a butchers* at that Heather Knight grab for the umpteenth time. *Am I hungry? Very meaty stuff, especially given the hour. 13th over: England 60-2 (Knight 18, Sciver 3) All a little cagey, lots on the line for both sides. England pick up three from Kerr\u2019s latest. 12th over: England 57-2 (Knight 17, Sciver 1) A maiden from Tahuhu (which is a lovely surname, especially to type if I may be so bold) Knight has looked cagey since the fall of Beaumont. She is foxed by a cutter that sees her through the shot early and almost, almost plops the ball straight to short cover. Feels like another wicket or two and this total and the pressure might begin to tell. 11th over: England 57-2 (Knight 17, Sciver 1) Kerr continues and England pick up four from the over. Congratulations to Lea Tahuhu! The win predictor flashes up with England at 77 per cent... but that will be all change as Lea Tahuhu bowls Beaumont! Full, touch of movement and the bails are sent flying into the breeze. That\u2019s the end of the powerplay, honours about even. 10th over: England 53-2 (Knight 14, Sciver 0) 9th over: England 48-1 (Beaumont 21, Knight 14) New Zealand might want to try a change of pace here, Knight and Beaumont look at ease with the seam up, pitched up stuff at the moment. A square drive brings Beaumont four and England grab seven from the over without having to break sweat. 8th over: England 41-1 (Beaumont 16, Knight 13) Shot! Heather Knight shows all of her class by unfurling a textbook on-drive off the new bowler, Lea Tahuhu. Full face, makers name. Delightful. These two look in fine fettle, gliding, punching and driving with ease to pick up ten runs off the over. 7th over: England 31-1 (Beaumont 13, Knight 6) Heather Knight, no doubt still on a high after that phenomenal catch of her own earlier, is into her work with a crisp drive off a low full toss through the covers for four. Sssstretch. Got it. 6th over: England 26-1 (Beaumont 13, Knight 1)England and Beaumont bust the shackles with a couple of leg side boundaries, too full and straight from Rowe and she is picked off. She responds with a decent yorker that Beaumont digs out well. 5th over: England 17-1 (Beaumont 5, Knight 0) Kerr joins the dots to make it back to back maidens. England just re-calibrating here after the early gung-ho. 4th over: England 17-1 (Beaumont 5, Knight 0) Rowe follows up her fine bit of fielding by reeling off a maiden. Including an absolute peach of an out-swinger to beat Heather Knight. Peach. Jaffa. Whichever fruit you prefer. Another Beaumont single brings Wyatt on to strike and she smears another four with a drive lofted through the covers. It\u2019s curtains the next ball though as another aerial drive is plucked out of the powder grey sky by Hannah Rowe! A fine grab. Wyatt looked in good knick, big wicket. 3rd over: England 17-1 (Beaumont 5, Knight 0) 2nd over: England 12-0 (Beaumont 4, Wyatt 8) Hannah Rowe from the other end and it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag. A single to Beaumont brings Wyatt on strike. Rowe beats her with a beauty that holds its line but Wyatt is not perturbed, she greets a full ball with a lofted drive for four over mid-off. 1st over: England 7-0 (Beaumont 3, Wyatt 4) The wind is gusting by the looks of the players\u2019 billowing shirts. Jess Kerr steams in to Tammy Beaumont. Touch of inswing. Three dots and then a shorter ball is hauled into the leg side by Beaumont to get England\u2019s cause underway. They scamper back for two. A drop and go single brings Danni Wyatt on to strike and she slaps a full toss away for four through the covers with her very first ball! A gift from Kerr and Wyatt does not miss out. Seven off the first. Thanks Megan and g\u2019day everyone! Jim here in a pitch black South London. Google maps tells me I\u2019m about 11, 388 miles from the action at Eden Park in Auckland. Feels further if anything... I\u2019m on the Ovaltine and ready for the call of the second half of this do or die game between holders and hosts. Where\u2019s your money? The New Zealand players are in a huddle and the England batters whirl and stretch and stride purposefully to the crease. Let\u2019s do this. This was certainly not what we were expecting after that excellent start from Devine and Bates. Brunt and Shrubsole struggled at the start, but good captaincy from Knight saved the innings. Rather than push her senior bowlers through, she took a chance on Cross - paired with the experienced Sciver - and it paid off in a big way, with the scoring drying up immediately. Then it was Ecclestone and Dean who were so economical, but also took some very key wickets and really pushed NZ into the danger zone. The loss of Devine to injury was unfortunate for NZ, as if she had been able to bat on, it may have been a different story. She is such a talismanic captain and can really shape an innings. She didn\u2019t look quite right when she came back and wasn\u2019t able to continue her momentum. Maddy Green was solid, but not sensational and Jess Kerr\u2019s late hitting looked like it could do some damage, but it was too little, too late. This doesn\u2019t look like enough runs on what we saw yesterday was a good batting wicket, but anything could happen from here. NZ are desperate to stay alive in this tournament and maybe they can pull off a miracle with the ball? Stay tuned, because it\u2019s certain to be a fascinating second innings. I\u2019ll hand you over now to the excellent James Wallace, who will take you through England\u2019s batting innings. Thanks for hanging out with me - I\u2019ll see you for another OBO very soon! 49th over: New Zealand 203 (Maddy Green 52, Jess Kerr 13) Brunt takes the penultimate over and Jess Kerr looks more like Melie Kerr as she cuts it beautifully through the gap for a boundary. Next ball she pulls it, but can\u2019t find the gap this time and it\u2019s just a single. Brunt\u2019s next ball is a touch too full and Green drives it well, but there\u2019s a fielder on the boundary to restrict her to one. Kerr picks up where she left off and brings up the 200 for NZ with a well-timed steer past deep backward point for four. But then she goes for two and miscommunication between the batters sees her out and NZ can\u2019t finish their overs. There\u2019s a mix up between the batters going for a second run and Kerr is gone, just as she was batting so strongly. A disappointing finish. 48th over: New Zealand 192-9 (Maddy Green 51, Jess Kerr 4) Sciver takes back over from Brunt and Green is facing up. She scampers through for a single off the second ball of the over to bring up her 50 - her first in a World Cup. She\u2019s been key for NZ today, but will wish she\u2019d been able to create a bigger strike rate. Kerr gets herself off strike again very quickly and they\u2019re really only working in singles here at the moment. Green pulls one aggressively, but again it\u2019s just a single that leaves Kerr on strike for the last ball of the over. She dashes through to keep the strike. 47th over: New Zealand 188-9 (Maddy Green 49, Jess Kerr 2) Things are looking more and more dire for NZ now and they\u2019re struggling to get over 200 here, which is a real worry. Ecclestone bowls her last over and starts with three dots to Kerr before a single gets Green back on strike. Green is looking frustrated at her inability to penetrate the field and she can only manage a single to end the over, but it means she keeps the strike at least. 46th over: New Zealand 186-9 (Maddy Green 48, Jess Kerr 1) Another Brunt over and after a couple of dots, she gets Kerr on strike, which is what England will want at the moment. Kerr strikes it confidently, but she can\u2019t get it past the field. She settles and gets off strike next ball as Green makes her away towards 50. This is much better bowling from Brunt, only two from the over. 45th over: New Zealand 184-9 (Maddy Green 47, Jess Kerr 0) Ecclestone bowls her ninth over and Green keeps the strike rotating. Jones uses her quick hands to end Rowe\u2019s innings and it\u2019s up to Jess Kerr now. Very quick hands behind the stumps from Jones to pick up a little edge from Rowe and it\u2019s more trouble for NZ. 44th over: New Zealand 182-8 (Maddy Green 46, Hannah Rowe 4) Brunt is back - let\u2019s see how she goes after that pretty ordinary start. She looks like she has a bit of a lower back issue after the first ball, but she keeps on going. She\u2019d finding her line much better at the start of the over, but she gives away another wide late in the over - she\u2019s not very happy with the decision though! 43rd over: New Zealand 177-8 (Maddy Green 43, Hannah Rowe 3) Ecclestone on for her eighth over of the day, it looks like she will bowl out here. Green gets a nice little edge that certainly wasn\u2019t intentional, but it races away for a boundary and NZ will take runs whichever way they can get them at this stage. Seven off the over again, this is better from NZ. 42nd over: New Zealand 170-8 (Maddy Green 37, Hannah Rowe 2) Green finds a pocket first up and gets a much-needed boundary from Cross\u2019s over. She then cuts it nicely for a single and gives Rowe a shot at Cross. Rowe is looking fairly confident for a number 10. It\u2019s a lot of pressure considering the situation the White Ferns find themselves in here. She gets Green back on strike and will be looking to support her to finish out this innings. A good seven from that over. 41st over: New Zealand 163-8 (Maddy Green 31, Hannah Rowe 1) Ecclestone is keen for a review on her second ball and Knight decides to let her take it - she\u2019s convinced the ball hit Mackay\u2019s pad first. She is indeed correct and Mackay ends her short stay at the crease. Green needs to be the one to score big here, but she\u2019s finding it very tough. After a great start, NZ have completely fallen away here and England are well on top. The umpire didn\u2019t think it was out and Mackay thought she got bat on it first, but Eccelstone convinces Knight to review it and it was pad first, so Mackay has to go. Things are completely falling apart for NZ now. 40th over: New Zealand 161-7 (Maddy Green 30, Frankie Mackay 1) Cross continues and keeps up the dot ball pressure, but once Devine gets on strike, she goes big. It looks a bit edgy but it falls safely. Next ball she tries it again, but this time Dean is there to take the catch and Devine can\u2019t save the day here. It\u2019s a short stay for Devine, she tries teeing off and gets one away, but her second attempt is caught by Dean and she has to go. 39th over: New Zealand 155-6 (Maddy Green 29, Sophie Devine 37) Ecclestone strikes early, but it brings Devine back - we\u2019ll see how injured she is and if she can continue her fine run of form from earlier today. It\u2019s a wicket maiden for Ecclestone - an excellent over for her. Tahuhu tries to go hard, but she can\u2019t get the ball past Knight who takes a stunning flying catch. Devine finally comes back to the crease to a huge cheer from the crowd. 38th over: New Zealand 155-5 (Maddy Green 29, Lea Tahuhu 0) Devine is back on the bench with pads on, standing up and keeping herself warm, so that\u2019s a welcome sight for NZ fans. It\u2019s a bit of an awkward situation now because she\u2019s just waiting for someone to get out so she can get back in. England offer her an opportunity by taking Martin\u2019s wicket, but Devine probably isn\u2019t as fine as she looks because Tahuhu comes to the crease instead. Perhaps Devine will be better suited to come in for a couple of overs at the end and smash it around. Tahuhu looks to get off the mark immediately, guiding the ball around the corner to leg gully, but she doesn\u2019t get bat on it and it\u2019s a leg bye. Green strikes with a much-needed boundary, driving it straight down the ground and getting it just wide of Dean in the outfield. Martin reviews because she suspects it\u2019s a tad too high, but the on field umpire had it right and she\u2019s on her way. 37th over: New Zealand 149-4 (Maddy Green 25, Katey Martin 5) Dean bowls her final over for the day and what a sensational day its been for her. She\u2019s really stemmed the flow of runs and made it very hard for NZ, as well as taking the vital wickets of Kerr and Satterthwaite. She nearly gets another in her final over as Martin chips one to Sciver, but it falls just short of her dive. 36th over: New Zealand 147-4 (Maddy Green 24, Katey Martin 4) Cross replaces Sciver - she had 1-15 from her first six overs, so she will be hoping to continue with that excellent effort. She starts well with a couple of dots and then Green and Martin manage a couple of quick singles to get the strike rotating. 35th over: New Zealand 143-4 (Maddy Green 23, Katey Martin 1) Dean looks like she\u2019ll bowl her 10 overs straight, as she\u2019s got the momentum now and has been very economical, as well as taking two wickets. She\u2019s not getting a lot of spin out of this pitch, but she\u2019s getting great flight and drift and the batters aren\u2019t able to get under the ball to get her away. Unfortunately a misfield from Ecclestone at mid-off releases the pressure and allows a boundary to Green. 34th over: New Zealand 139-4 (Maddy Green 19, Katey Martin 1) Sciver is back to bowl after that excellent run out. Martin and Green take a single each to start the over, looking to keep the strike rotating. The run rate is back above four, but they\u2019ll want to keep pushing it. There\u2019s an appeal for caught behind and the umpire gives it out, but Green is very quick to review and the third umpire confirms there\u2019s no bat involved and she\u2019s safe. 33rd over: New Zealand 137-4 (Maddy Green 18, Katey Martin 0) Dean takes her eighth over straight, which is a good move from Knight - why not keep her going while she\u2019s bowling this well? It will be interesting to see when we get Brunt and Shrubsole back into the attack after their less-than-brilliant effort to start the match. The pressure starts to get to the batters and they take an unwise single that spells the end of Brooke Halliday\u2019s innings. Well that is not what NZ needed. The quick single wasn\u2019t really on and Sciver took full advantage with an excellent and accurate throw. 32nd over: New Zealand 136-3 (Maddy Green 18, Brooke Halliday 1) Sciver takes the second over of her second spell and Halliday can\u2019t do more than defend it back for the first couple of balls. Sciver\u2019s line and length is pretty much perfect this over and she\u2019s not giving Halliday anything to work with. Eventually she finds a leg bye and gets off strike for the final ball of the over. 31st over: New Zealand 135-3 (Maddy Green 18, Brooke Halliday 1) Just the single bowling change this time as Dean continues. She starts well, but Satterthwaite moves to the second ball and pushes her hands through to find one of the pockets of the ground for a lovely four. However Dean gets her sweeping and sneaks one through the gap to find her pad and she has to go just as she\u2019s finding momentum. An important breakthrough for England here and Brooke Halliday comes to the crease. Satterthwaite reviews and it\u2019s an umpire\u2019s call, but she has to go. She\u2019d been looking to go big and was starting to find momentum, but Dean gets past her bat as she tries to sweep and sends her on her way. 30th over: New Zealand 130-2 (Maddy Green 18, Amy Satterthwaite 20) Sciver is back and Green immediately uses the pace of the ball to pick up two, then gets a little outside edge for a single. Satterthwaite rushes through for a quick single, but a bad throw gives them two instead on overthrows. Knight misses one in the field to give away another single and NZ are starting to find some momentum. A little edge from Green offers Jones a half chance at a catch, but she can\u2019t hold on to it. 29th over: New Zealand 124-2 (Maddy Green 15, Amy Satterthwaite 17) Dean continues to Green, who defends a couple of balls before cutting one to deep cover for a single. The urgency from the last over has dissipated, but Satterthwaite manages to paddle one around the corner for a boundary from the last ball of the over to keep a bit of pace in the game. 28th over: New Zealand 119-2 (Maddy Green 14, Amy Satterthwaite 13) Green gives us some of the urgency that\u2019s been lacking with a sensational 69m six - driving it over long on. She takes the single next ball and then Satterthwaite drives it down the ground for four. It seems like they\u2019ve flicked a switch this over! Satterthwaite follows up with an aggressive pull shot, but it\u2019s just a single this time. Importantly they\u2019re not letting the dot ball pressure build this over though. Just the one dot ball this over and it was the final ball. 27th over: New Zealand 106-2 (Maddy Green 6, Amy Satterthwaite 8) Wyatt fumbles one in the field, but NZ don\u2019t take a run from it, there still doesn\u2019t seem to be too much urgency out there. Dean and Ecclestone have picked up where Sciver and Cross left off. Dean manages some excellent fielding off her own bowling and they\u2019re just piling on the pressure, with the run rate dropping below four now - it was above seven at one stage in this match. 26th over: New Zealand 104-2 (Maddy Green 5, Amy Satterthwaite 7) Past the halfway point now and the spin continues with Ecclestone. It\u2019s been a sensational fight back from England - NZ looked to be completely in control early in the match, but now England are driving the pace. Satterthwaite gets one away over the infield, but it\u2019s easily cut off by the field and she\u2019s restricted to a single. 25th over: New Zealand 101-2 (Maddy Green 4, Amy Satterthwaite 5) NZ bring up their hundred - the second fifty certainly wasn\u2019t as quick as their first and Green will be hoping to bump up the run rate again. It\u2019s a good batting pitch and they will need a decent amount of runs to defend here. Dean is bowling very well and NZ are finding it tough. 24th over: New Zealand 99-2 (Maddy Green 2, Amy Satterthwaite 5) Ecclestone continues and Green gets off the mark immediately, which will put her mind at ease a little. Some news on Devine, she has some back soreness and the medical staff are seeing how she responds to treatment before making a decision about whether she can continue. 23rd over: New Zealand 96-2 (Maddy Green 0, Amy Satterthwaite 4) Sattherthwaite starts Dean\u2019s over with a cut for a single and nearly takes out Kerr as they take the run. Fortunately they avoid each other and Dean misses her length next ball, allowing Kerr to slog sweep it to the boundary for four. Dean fights back with a couple of dots and the pressure gets to Kerr, top edging one and losing her wicket. Kerr knows she has to push the scoring forward and she takes too big a risk, top edging one straight up in the air, which Shrubsole takes easily. 22nd over: New Zealand 91-1 (Amelia Kerr 20, Amy Satterthwaite 3) Kerr starts Ecclestone\u2019s next over with a boundary, defends one back and then rotates the strike to Satterthwaite. She gets her feet to the ball and manages to loft one over the infield for a single. 21st over: New Zealand 85-1 (Amelia Kerr 15, Amy Satterthwaite 2) Another over for Dean and Kerr picks up the length quickly and pulls one away aggressively, but it\u2019s straight to the field and it\u2019s just a single. It\u2019s a good over for England, just that one run from it. 20th over: New Zealand 84-1 (Amelia Kerr 14, Amy Satterthwaite 2) Another double bowling change and we get spin from both ends with Sophie Ecclestone getting her first over. Word from the NZ changerooms is that Devine\u2019s injury is still being assessed, so we\u2019ll see what happens once that assessment is completed. Kerr definitely looks happier against the spin with a nice back foot drive to deep cover for two early in the over. There\u2019s an appeal late in the over for LBW - it doesn\u2019t look like much and the umpire isn\u2019t interested, but Knight decides to review. Ball tracking confirms it\u2019s going down leg and England lose the review. 19th over: New Zealand 81-1 (Amelia Kerr 11, Amy Satterthwaite 2) We see some spin for the first time today as Charlie Dean enters the attack. Kerr looks to attack right away with a cut shot that she looks like running on, but it goes straight to the field and she doesn\u2019t chance it. Eventually she finds some space and takes a quick two to ease the pressure. She then lets the ball comes on to her bat and just uses her wrists to guide one down to third and picks up three. Satterthwaite comes to the party with a quick single - both batters look much more comfortable against the spin. 18th over: New Zealand 74-1 (Amelia Kerr 5, Amy Satterthwaite 1) Cross and Sciver have done an excellent job to bring the run rate right down and neither of these two batters looks settled just yet. There\u2019s not a lot of urgency out there - the shots that are going to the edge of the infield that were seeing Devine and Bates drop and run are leaving Satterthwaite and Kerr completely unmoved. Clearly they don\u2019t want to take too many risks and lose a wicket, but they\u2019re allowing the dot ball pressure to build, which is just what England want. 17th over: New Zealand 73-1 (Amelia Kerr 5, Amy Satterthwaite 1) Sciver continues her spell and Satterthwaite defends it back to her for the first three balls, before eventually getting off the mark with a glance to fine leg for a single. It\u2019s a good, tight over from Sciver, just one from it. 16th over: New Zealand 72-1 (Amelia Kerr 5, Amy Satterthwaite 0) Cross continues her good work and this second bowling partnership is a much better one for England - it was a good call from Knight to bring them in when she did. Kerr has the ability to go big, but she doesn\u2019t seem to be finding the balls she wants to attack just yet. She is starting to look a little uncomfortable with the dot ball pressure and England will look to take advantage of that to dismiss her cheaply. There\u2019s a bit of a mix up when everyone thinks the over is completed after five balls, but we get it sorted and Cross bowls the final ball and Kerr will be glad they figured out there was one ball left because she lofts it over the infield for four. 15th over: New Zealand 68-1 (Amelia Kerr 1, Amy Satterthwaite 0) Amy Satterthwaite replaces Devine and will hope to continue her momentum. The good news for England is that they now have two new batters at the crease. While it hasn\u2019t happened the way they would have liked or planned, they will look to take advantage of the situation and unsettle the pair before they find their feet. Kerr finally gets off the mark and Sciver gets very close to taking Satterthwaite\u2019s wicket. She can\u2019t continue right now, so she\u2019s hobbling off the field, but she smiles and gives a thumbs up, so we hope we\u2019ll see her back later in the innings. Ooh some bad news for Devine and NZ here, she turns for a second run and something gives way and she crumbles to the ground. The medical staff come on to the ground to take a look. As someone who covers and watches a lot of netball, it didn\u2019t look like an ACL to me, which was what my initial worry was when she went down. She\u2019s clutched her thigh as she\u2019s gone down, so perhaps some kind of quad strain? Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s nothing serious. 14th over: New Zealand 66-1 (Amelia Kerr 0, Sophie Devine 36) Kerr gets her first look at Cross for today after Devine takes a quick single and again she is happy to defend the ball back and take her time to get into this innings. Cross has been the pick of the England bowlers so far, her line and length have been excellent and she is making the batters work hard for every run. It\u2019s another great over from her, just the one from it. 13th over: New Zealand 65-1 (Amelia Kerr 0, Sophie Devine 35) While England will be happy with that wicket, there\u2019s not too much for them to celebrate about the partnership of Devine and Amelia Kerr at the crease - NZ\u2019s two best batters so far at this tournament. They will want to break this partnership sooner rather than later. Kerr defends her first ball - the good start from the openers gives her a chance to settle into her innings a little rather than having to go hard from the start. She sees out the last two balls of the over without scoring. 12th over: New Zealand 61-1 (Amelia Kerr 0, Sophie Devine 32) Kate Cross continues and Devine immediately rotates the strike. Cross is finding some good length and she gets Bates mistiming one in the air, but it falls safely. Cross is interested in a caught behind, but the umpire isn\u2019t and Knight decides not to review. Eventually Cross\u2019s length balls catch Bates going too hard and mis-timing and England have their first wicket. After a few excellent balls from Cross she finally lures Bates into her trap with a length ball on middle stump that sees Bates driving and mis-timing it for a simple catch to Beaumont. 11th over: New Zealand 58-0 (Suzie Bates 20, Sophie Devine 30) Bates is looking to up her strike rate, but she struggles to get Sciver away at the start of the over. She\u2019s finding the room and getting the shots away, but can\u2019t quite time them to get through the field. Eventually she times one well enough to cut it through backward point for two. Then she drives one straight down the ground for four and looks to be settling into her innings now. 10th over: New Zealand 52-0 (Suzie Bates 14, Sophie Devine 30) Devine seems to have seen enough of Cross now to have a shot at her and she cuts one beautifully for four, bringing up the 50 run partnership. Devine is clearly batting out of her crease as well and now the umpire comes in to have a word with her about it. This is getting quite bizarre now. There is the ability for the umpires to award penalty runs if they deem this to be an ongoing problem, so something to keep in mind. 9th over: New Zealand 48-0 (Suzie Bates 14, Sophie Devine 26) And another bowling change - perhaps Knight has recognised that an angry Brunt isn\u2019t going to settle into her line and length just yet. Instead we get Nat Sciver replacing her and she starts well and then bowls a shorter one, which Devine guides away down to third, but there\u2019s a fielder set quite fine there and she\u2019s restricted to one. These new bowlers have successfully slowed down the NZ batters, getting the run rate back below six. 8th over: New Zealand 45-0 (Suzie Bates 13, Sophie Devine 24) We have our first bowling change, with Kate Cross replacing Shrubsole. She gets her line and length right first up and Devine can only defend it away for the first couple of balls. She steals a quick run on the third - it doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s anything on at all, it\u2019s a similar defensive shot, but some quick running sees them home and gets Bates on strike. Bates takes a bit swing at a ball, but Cross has done a good job and gets it past her. Now the umpire comes in to have a word with Bates and tells her she\u2019s batting too far out of her crease, which is an interesting talking point. Does anyone remember seeing that happen before? 7th over: New Zealand 44-0 (Suzie Bates 13, Sophie Devine 23) Brunt to Bates now and Bates doesn\u2019t look quite in her groove yet, but she seems comfortable enough playing the support role to Devine for now. Brunt starts to build the dot ball pressure on her and Devine gives her some reassurance, which seems to do the trick because next ball Brunt bowls one just short of a length and Bates pulls it away strongly to the boundary for four. It\u2019s a decent over from Brunt, just the four from it, but she doesn\u2019t look happy at all. 6th over: New Zealand 40-0 (Suzie Bates 9, Sophie Devine 23) Shrubsole continues and Bates takes a ball to consider her approach and then looks for one of those Eden Park pockets - she can\u2019t quite get it to the boundary, but some good running gets them three. Shrubsole puts one wide down the leg side, but Devine comes out to meet it, picks it up early and sweeps it away for four. She follows it up with a similar shot, putting it behind square towards a pocket and picks up another two. 5th over: New Zealand 31-0 (Suzie Bates 6, Sophie Devine 17) The rain is back, but the teams are playing on for now. The ground staff are poised at the boundary with the covers ready, so we could stop at any moment, but it\u2019s good to see them stay out there for now. Brunt continues her spell and Devine takes another easy two to start the over. Brunt then manages five dots in a row, which is a good sign that she\u2019s starting to find her line and length. It\u2019s England\u2019s best over so far - just the two from it. 4th over: New Zealand 29-0 (Suzie Bates 6, Sophie Devine 15) Devine and Bates look completely untroubled at the moment, they\u2019re cruising along at a good clip and not finding it necessary to play it safe early while they get a feel for the ground and the bowlers. Devine finds one of those weird pockets of the ground and the quick outfield assists the ball in getting to the rope - she\u2019s looking dangerous early. 3rd over: New Zealand 23-0 (Suzie Bates 5, Sophie Devine 10) Devine takes a quick single Bates finally gets her chance for a boundary - her strike rate looks poor, but she has faced a lot of poor balls from England that have resulted in extras, so she has played her role so far. NZ certainly aren\u2019t letting any dot ball pressure build on them early, they\u2019re dropping and running whenever they get the chance and cleverly maneuvering the ball around the field for ones and twos. 2nd over: New Zealand 17-0 (Suzie Bates 1, Sophie Devine 9) Shrubsole opens from the other end and surprise! She starts with a wide. She gets her line right next ball, but the one after that is too straight and Bates gets a couple of leg byes - a good save by Ecclestone on the boundary stops it being four. Shrubsole adds another wide to her tally in the middle of the over and Heather Knight is looking a little frustrated that her senior bowlers aren\u2019t able to find their line early in this match. Devine drives one through the covers for three - it nearly gets to the boundary but some good fielding from Beaumont and Dunkley cuts it off. It\u2019s another good over for NZ. 1st over: New Zealand 9-0 (Suzie Bates 1, Sophie Devine 6) Here we go in this must-win clash for both teams. Devine and Bates get us started, while Katherine Brunt takes the new ball for England, as we have become accustomed to. She has a slip in place to start against Bates. Well in a continuation from yesterday, we start with a wide. Ellyse Perry struggled with her line yesterday, bowling six wides in her first over. But Brunt recovers her line quickly with an LBW appeal on the next ball, but it\u2019s too high. She follows it up with another wide and then abandons her run up on the re-attempt. It\u2019s extremely windy at Eden Park and the bowlers will need to adjust quickly. Bates finally gets one she can hit and she\u2019s off the mark with a single. Devine takes a ball to get her eye in and then she tucks one away to square leg for two to get off the mark, followed by a beautiful cut away for four.

Sophie Devine is happy with the result as well, as she was planning to bat first. Both teams are unchanged since their previous matches. If you missed the action from Eden Park yesterday, you can catch up on our OBO from Australia v India. It featured plenty of momentum swings and will tell you plenty about what a good batting wicket it is in Auckland. India were good enough to get the match into the final over, but Beth Mooney was calm under pressure to get the job done in three balls. There are some deep pockets in this field and Australia were able to take advantage of those weird little spaces to run plenty of twos - something both NZ and England will have taken note of for today\u2019s game. The toss has been delayed due to a bit of a downpour in Auckland, but there will be no delay to the first ball at this stage. It looks a bit windy out at Eden Park, but there is some blue sky and sunshine peeking through, so hopefully we won\u2019t lose any overs. Good morning and what a match we\u2019re about to have on our hands here! After disappointing tournaments so far, both teams are absolutely desperate for a win today to keep their World Cup hopes alive. England bounced back from a woeful start to crush India in their last match, restricting them to 134 and chasing down that total in 31.2 overs to give their net run rate a much needed boost. New Zealand have looked excellent at times, but close losses to South Africa and West Indies, as well as comprehensive defeat at the hands of Australia have derailed the hosts. It\u2019s all on the line today and both teams have everything to lose, so it will be fascinating to watch.",

It\u2019s a small sacrifice.</p> <p>Yet guess who\u2019s making no sacrifice at all \u2013 in fact, who\u2019s reaping a giant windfall from this crisis?</p> <p>Big oil has hit a gusher. Even before Vladimir Putin\u2019s war, oil prices had begun to rise due to the recovery in global demand and tight inventories.</p> <p>Last year, when Americans were already struggling to pay their heating bills and fill up their gas tanks, the biggest oil companies (Shell, Chevron, BP, and Exxon) posted profits totaling <a href=\"https://www.accountable.us/news/big-oil-companies-net-75-billion-in-profit-while-americans-struggle-to-heat-homes-fill-gas-tanks/\">$75bn</a>. This year, courtesy of Putin, big oil is on the way to a far bigger bonanza.</p> <p>How are the oil companies using this windfall? I can assure you they\u2019re not investing in renewables. They\u2019re not even increasing oil production.</p> <p>As Chevron\u2019s top executive, Mike Wirth, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/chevron-ceo-warns-of-high-energy-prices-and-supply-crunches?sref=0KUfhQHv\">said</a> in September, \u201cWe could afford to invest more\u201d but \u201cthe equity market is not sending a signal that says they think we ought to be doing that.\u201d</p> <p>Translated: Wall Street says the way to maximize profits is to limit supply and push up prices instead.</p> <p>So they\u2019re buying <em>back</em> their own stock in order to give their stock prices even more of a boost. Last year they spent $38bn on stock buybacks \u2013 their biggest buyback spending spree since 2008. This year, thanks largely to Putin, the oil giants are planning to buy back at least $22bn <em>more</em>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Republicans will balk at any tax increase on big oil, of course</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Make no mistake. This is a direct redistribution from consumers who are paying through the nose at the gas pump to big oil\u2019s investors and top executives (whose compensation packages are larded with shares of stock and stock options).</p> <p>Though it\u2019s seldom discussed in the media, lower-income earners and their families bear the brunt of the burden of higher gas prices. Not only are lower-income people less likely to be able to work from home, they\u2019re also more likely to commute for longer distances between work and home in order to afford less expensive housing.</p> <p>Big oil companies <em>could</em> absorb the higher costs of crude oil. The reason they\u2019re not is because they\u2019re so big they don\u2019t have to. They don\u2019t worry about losing market share to competitors. So they\u2019re passing on the higher costs to consumers in the form of higher prices, and pocketing record profits.</p> <p>It\u2019s the same old story in this country: when crisis strikes, the poor and working class are on the frontlines while the biggest corporations and their investors and top brass rake it in.</p> <p>What to do? Hit big oil with a windfall profits tax.</p> <p>The European Union recently advised its members to seek a windfall profits tax on oil companies taking advantage of this very grave emergency to raise their prices.</p> <p>Democrats just introduced similar legislation here in the US. The bill would tax the largest oil companies, which are recording their biggest profits in years, and use the money to provide quarterly checks to Americans facing sticker shock as inflation continues to soar.</p> <p>It would require oil companies producing or importing at least 300,000 barrels of oil per day to pay a per-barrel tax equal to half the difference between the <em>current</em> price of a barrel and the <em>average price from the years 2015 to 2019.</em></p> <p>This is hardly confiscatory. Those were years when energy companies were already recording large profits. Quarterly rebates to consumers would phase out for individuals earning more than $75,000 or couples earning $150,000.</p> <p>Republicans will balk at any tax increase on big oil, of course. They and the coal-industry senator Joe Manchin even tanked the nomination of Sarah Bloom Raskin to the Fed because she had the temerity to speak out about the systemic risks that climate change poses to our economy.</p> <p>But a windfall profits tax on big oil is exactly what Democrats must do to help average working people through this fuel crisis.

      "bodyText": "This morning I filled my car with gas, costing almost six dollars a gallon. My car is a Mini Cooper I bought years ago, partly because it wasn\u2019t a gas-guzzler. Now it\u2019s guzzling dollars. When I consider what\u2019s happening in Ukraine, I say what the hell. It\u2019s a small sacrifice. Yet guess who\u2019s making no sacrifice at all \u2013 in fact, who\u2019s reaping a giant windfall from this crisis? Big oil has hit a gusher. Even before Vladimir Putin\u2019s war, oil prices had begun to rise due to the recovery in global demand and tight inventories. Last year, when Americans were already struggling to pay their heating bills and fill up their gas tanks, the biggest oil companies (Shell, Chevron, BP, and Exxon) posted profits totaling $75bn. This year, courtesy of Putin, big oil is on the way to a far bigger bonanza. How are the oil companies using this windfall? I can assure you they\u2019re not investing in renewables. They\u2019re not even increasing oil production. As Chevron\u2019s top executive, Mike Wirth, said in September, \u201cWe could afford to invest more\u201d but \u201cthe equity market is not sending a signal that says they think we ought to be doing that.\u201d Translated: Wall Street says the way to maximize profits is to limit supply and push up prices instead. So they\u2019re buying back their own stock in order to give their stock prices even more of a boost. Last year they spent $38bn on stock buybacks \u2013 their biggest buyback spending spree since 2008. This year, thanks largely to Putin, the oil giants are planning to buy back at least $22bn more. Make no mistake. This is a direct redistribution from consumers who are paying through the nose at the gas pump to big oil\u2019s investors and top executives (whose compensation packages are larded with shares of stock and stock options). Though it\u2019s seldom discussed in the media, lower-income earners and their families bear the brunt of the burden of higher gas prices. Not only are lower-income people less likely to be able to work from home, they\u2019re also more likely to commute for longer distances between work and home in order to afford less expensive housing. Big oil companies could absorb the higher costs of crude oil. The reason they\u2019re not is because they\u2019re so big they don\u2019t have to. They don\u2019t worry about losing market share to competitors. So they\u2019re passing on the higher costs to consumers in the form of higher prices, and pocketing record profits. It\u2019s the same old story in this country: when crisis strikes, the poor and working class are on the frontlines while the biggest corporations and their investors and top brass rake it in. What to do? Hit big oil with a windfall profits tax. The European Union recently advised its members to seek a windfall profits tax on oil companies taking advantage of this very grave emergency to raise their prices. Democrats just introduced similar legislation here in the US. The bill would tax the largest oil companies, which are recording their biggest profits in years, and use the money to provide quarterly checks to Americans facing sticker shock as inflation continues to soar. It would require oil companies producing or importing at least 300,000 barrels of oil per day to pay a per-barrel tax equal to half the difference between the current price of a barrel and the average price from the years 2015 to 2019. This is hardly confiscatory. Those were years when energy companies were already recording large profits. Quarterly rebates to consumers would phase out for individuals earning more than $75,000 or couples earning $150,000. Republicans will balk at any tax increase on big oil, of course. They and the coal-industry senator Joe Manchin even tanked the nomination of Sarah Bloom Raskin to the Fed because she had the temerity to speak out about the systemic risks that climate change poses to our economy. But a windfall profits tax on big oil is exactly what Democrats must do to help average working people through this fuel crisis. It\u2019s good policy, it\u2019s good politics and it\u2019s the right thing to do.

Former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/17/arnold-schwarzenegger-video-russia-putin-ukraine\">released a nine-minute video</a> in which he recalled his admiration for the Soviet weightlifter Yuri Vlasov and his father\u2019s shame at fighting for the Nazi army at Leningrad. \u201cThis is not the Russian people\u2019s war,\u201d he said in an appeal to ordinary Russians.</p> \n  <p>But others in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a> say it is. Many supporters cite the eight-year-old war between Ukraine and Russian proxy forces in Donbas, using words such as genocide and comparisons to the second world war to justify the invasion.</p> \n  <p>As one former diplomat wrote in a WhatsApp message, he looks forward to Russia holding a \u201cNuremberg 2.0\u201d in Ukraine after the war. \u201cAren\u2019t you sad for the children killed in Donbas?\u201d Elizaveta from Moscow shot back when asked about her views on the invasion. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you write about them instead?\u201d</p> \n  <p>Russian society is deeply polarised between supporters and opponents of the Kremlin. Those camps have carried this division over into support for and opposition to the war, experts said. Even simple choices such as whether to call the conflict a \u201cwar\u201d or the state-sanctioned \u201cmilitary operation\u201d carry political meaning.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe are seeing that society is divided by a majority that broadly supports the war and a minority that is against it,\u201d said Sergei Belanovsky, a sociologist. \u201cThese two groups live in different worlds, and cannot convince each other that their viewpoint is the right one.\u201d</p> \n  <p>According to the state-run Russian Public Opinion Research Center, 71% of Russians \u201csupport Russia\u2019s decision to hold a special military operation in Ukraine\u201d. Valery Fyodorov, head of the polling centre, said that new data to be published by the centre this week would show an increase in support for the \u201cmilitary operation\u201d.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/19/vladimir-putin-waves-the-flag-in-a-polarised-country-where-views-are-hard-to-shift\">Vladimir Putin waves the flag in a polarised country where views are hard to shift</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-03-19T23:47:28.436Z\">at 11.47pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-623663788f0832c62ade1edc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-03-19T23:13:04.079Z\">11.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The most recent <strong>intelligence</strong> update from the <strong>UK Ministry of Defence</strong> says that Russia has still failed to gain control of Ukrainian airspace, one of its main objectives. </p> \n  <p>\u201cTheir continued failure to do so has significantly blunted their operational progress,\u201d reads the statement. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1505320790086062083\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 19 March 2022<br> <br>Find out more about the UK government's response: <a href=\"https://t.co/2whpSpRbwX\">https://t.co/2whpSpRbwX</a><br><br>\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/StandWithUkraine?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#StandWithUkraine</a> \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 <a href=\"https://t.co/CcIp8qZg3w\">pic.twitter.com/CcIp8qZg3w</a></p>\u2014 Ministry of Defence \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 (@DefenceHQ) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1505320790086062083?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 19, 2022</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-03-19T23:22:56.088Z\">at 11.22pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62365ff08f081efd3276fc03\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-03-19T22:58:46.596Z\">10.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Kyiv Independent is reporting that a Russian diplomat made vague comments about Russia having plans to confront NATO on Bosnian TV. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1505314911232139264\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u26a1\ufe0fRussian diplomat: \"We have plans against NATO.\" <br><br>Igor Kalabukhov, Russian ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, said in an interview with Bosnia's Face TV that Moscow is \u201cassessing the geo-strategic situation\" and will respond to threats.</p>\u2014 The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1505314911232139264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 19, 2022</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-623654ea8f081efd3276fbcd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-03-19T22:11:26.064Z\">10.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Mariupol City Council says residents are being taken to Russia</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Residents of <strong>Mariupol</strong>, which is being continuously bombed by Russia, have been <strong>taken to Russia</strong> over the last week, the Mariupol city council is reporting. </p> \n  <p>The council said that \u201cseveral thousand Mariupol residents were deported to Russia.

\u201cfamous recent example\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The comparison was condemned by Tory peer Lord Barwell, who pointed out Ukraine is seeking to join the EU.</p> \n  <p>Writing on Twitter, he said: \u201cApart from the bit where voting in a free and fair referendum isn\u2019t in any way comparable with risking your life to defend your country against invasion + the awkward fact the Ukrainians are fighting for the freedom to join the EU, this comparison is bang on.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the Prime Minister \u201cis a national embarrassment\u201d, adding: \u201cTo compare a referendum to women and children fleeing (Vladimir) Putin\u2019s bombs is an insult to every Ukrainian.<br></p> \n  <p>SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said: \u201cBoris

More than 6,600 Ukrainians were evacuated from besieged cities through eight humanitarian corridors on Saturday, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. Thousands of residents of Mariupol have been taken to Russia against their will, where they have been \u201credirected\u201d to remote cities in the country, the Mariupol city council has said. The UK ministry of defence said Russia has still failed to gain control of the skies over Ukraine. China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, says his country is \u201con the right side of history\u201d as it continues to rail against sanctions imposed on Russia and deny it is considering supplying weapons to Moscow. Australia has banned the sale of alumina and aluminium ores to Russia, in an effort to limit Russia\u2019s munitions production. Australian supplies 20% of Russia\u2019s alumina. Poland has proposed that the EU implement a total ban on trade with Russia, the country\u2019s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said. Russia said it had used hypersonic weapons, which travel fast enough to evade detection by missile defence systems, to destroy an underground military depot in western Ukraine. Boris Johnson has come under heavy criticism for comparing the struggle of Ukrainians fighting to the British public voting for Brexit. Kyiv officials have reported that 228 people, including four children, have been killed in Ukraine\u2019s capitol. Ukraine\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs reported that 14,400 Russian personnel have been killed since the start of the war. Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for \u201cmeaningful, fair\u201d peace talks to take place urgently. He told Moscow that Russian losses would otherwise be so huge it would take generations to recover. \u201cNegotiations on peace, on security for us, for Ukraine \u2013 meaningful, fair and without delay \u2013 are the only chance for Russia to reduce the damage from its own mistakes,\u201d he said. Zelenskiy also urged Switzerland to crack down on Russian oligarchs who he said are helping to wage war on Ukraine from the safety of \u201cbeautiful Swiss towns\u201d. The southern city of Zaporizhzhia entered a 38-hour curfew beginning at 1400 GMT on Saturday (1600 local time) after the Ukrainian military ordered people to stay home until early on Monday. Aid agencies are being prevented from reaching people trapped in Ukrainian cities surrounded by Russian forces, the World Food Programme said. Ukraine may not produce enough crops to export if this year\u2019s sowing season is disrupted by Russia\u2019s invasion, the presidential adviser Oleh Ustenko has said. Ten humanitarian corridors were agreed on with Russia for the evacuation of citizens, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has said. China\u2019s foreign minister says the country time will tell that they stand on the right side of history over the Ukraine crisis. Reuters reports the minister Wang Yi told reporters on Saturday China had \u201calways stood for maintaining peace and opposing war, and that its position was \u201cobjective and fair, and is in line with the wishes of most countries\u201d. \u201cTime will prove that China\u2019s claims are on the right side of history,\u201d he said according to a statement published by the ministry. China\u2019s government holds conflicting positions on the war. It has projected itself as a neutral power, saying it respects Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty as well as Russia\u2019s \u201csecurity concerns\u201d, and says it could mediate. It has refused to condemn Russia\u2019s actions or call it an \u201cinvasion\u201d, has voted alongside it at international bodies, and the US has significant concerns it is considering supplying weapons to Russia (which Beijing denies). It has repeatedly objected to the use of economic sanctions against Russia. \u201cChina will never accept any external coercion or pressure, and opposes any unfounded accusations and suspicious against China,\u201d Wang told reporters on Saturday evening. Wang\u2019s comments followed a Friday video call between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping, during which Biden warned Xi of \u201cconsequences\u201d if Beijing gave material support to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Xi told Biden the war in Ukraine must end as soon as possible and called on NATO nations to hold a dialogue with Moscow. He did not, however, assign blame to Russia, according to Beijing\u2019s statements about the call, Reuters reported. Russian troops have reportedly stopped a convoy of busses traveling to Mariupol to evacuate residents, according to the Kyiv Independent. Citing the Berdyansk City council, the outlet said the convoy was stopped a few kilometres outside Berdyansk and refused entry into the city limits, and the drivers were not permitted to spend the night. The Guardian has not independently verified the report. Berdyansk is about 85km by road from Mariupol, which is under heavy siege by Russian forces. Local authorities have accused Russia of forcibly taking thousands of Mariupol residents to Russia against their will. The New York Times has some more detail on the claims by Mariupol City Council that residents are being taken to Russia against their will. Pyotr Andryuschenko, an assistant to the city\u2019s mayor, accused Russian forces of taking \u201cbetween 4,000 and 4,500 Mariupol residents forcibly across the border to Taganrog\u201d without their passports. Andryuschenko said thousands of people had been sheltering at a sporting complex in the city centre, and he believed many of those inside were being taken to Russia. Other Mariupol residents said they had heard from friends and neighbors who relayed having been taken across the border without their consent. Eduard Zarubin, a doctor who left the city on Wednesday, said he had been in touch with three families who had been forcibly taken to Taganrog by Russian soldiers. \u201cNow the Russians are walking through the basements, and if there are people left there, they forcibly take them to Taganrog,\u201d Mr. Zarubin, 50, said. In one case, he said, the whole family of one of his friends was taken away, as was the family of his friend\u2019s brother. A senior Chinese government official said on Saturday that sanctions imposed by Western nations on Russia over Ukraine are increasingly \u201coutrageous\u201d, according to a recent Reuters report. China\u2019s vice foreign minister Le Yucheng also acknowledged Moscow\u2019s point of view on NATO, saying the alliance should not further expand eastwards, forcing a nuclear power like Russia \u201cinto a corner\u201d. \u201cThe sanctions against Russia are getting more and more outrageous,\u201d Le said at security forum in Beijing, adding that Russian citizens were being deprived of overseas assets \u201cfor no reason\u201d. \u201cHistory has proven time and again that sanctions cannot solve problems. Sanctions will only harm ordinary people, impact the economic and financial system... and worsen the global economy.\u201d Beijing decries the use of sanctions in general, as unauthorised and unilateral, but has often used trade as an unofficial diplomatic weapon against countries with which it is in diplomatic dispute, including Lithuania and Australia. China\u2019s government has refused to label Russia\u2019s assault on Ukraine as an \u201cinvasion\u201d. It has sought to present itself as a neutral potential mediator, and denied US claims that it is considering a Russian request to supply weapons. However in recent weeks it has repeatedly abstained from voting in multilateral resolutions aimed at Russia, or voting alongside it, including against the International Court of Justice\u2019s recent demand that Russia withdraw its troops. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy published a video address just a short time ago. Here is an excerpt being reported by Ukrainian media. The 24th day of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine is over. After eight years of aggression, Ukrainians have proved that they know how to fight more professionally than an army that has been fighting for decades in different regions and under different conditions. We respond with wisdom and courage to the huge number of their equipment and soldiers sent to Ukraine. That is why, for example, the Ukrainian Chornobayivka will go down in war history. This is a place where the Russian military and their commanders have shown themselves completely as they are: incompetent, able to simply drive their people to slaughter. Zelenskiy said more than 6,600 people were evacuated through eight humanitarian corridors on Saturday, including from Bervytsia and Bucha. \u201cDue to the shelling of the occupiers, we were unable to remove people from Borodyanka, Kyiv region,\u201d he said. \u201cMore than 4,000 Mariupol residents managed to leave for Zaporizhia.\u201d Australia has banned the sale of alumina and aluminium ores to Russia in response to what it described as \u201cunrelenting and illegal aggression\u201d towards Ukraine, reports Christopher Knaus. The country\u2019s federal government has been under pressure to stop the export of alumina to Russia, with critics warning it was potentially allowing Australian resources to be used in munitions manufacturing. The government overnight announced it was ceasing all exports of alumina and aluminum ores, including bauxite, to limit Russia\u2019s ability to produce aluminium, a major Russian export and a critical component in arms and munitions. Russia relies on Australia for 20% of its alumina needs. Hello, this is Helen Davidson here to take you through the news developments for the next few hours. Russian cosmonauts on the International Space Station have rejected claims their yellow and blue flight suits are a nod to Ukraine, and have expressed support for their president. Cosmonauts Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveyev and Sergey Korsakov, of Russian space corporation Roscosmos, docked at the ISS late on Friday. Their uniforms - bright yellow with blue accents, sparked immediate questions about whether it was tacit message of support. Shortly after arriving Artemyev was asked and said the crew had just \u201caccumulated a lot of yellow material so we needed to use it\u201d. In a follow up statement published on the Russian space agency\u2019s Telegram channel, he again urged people to not \u201clook for any hidden signs or symbols\u201d in the suits. \u201cA colour is simply a colour. It is not in any way connected to Ukraine. Otherwise, we would have to recognise its rights to the yellow sun in the blue sky. \u201cThese days, even though we are in space, we are together with our president and our people!\u201d He gave a different reason for the choice this time - saying the crew chose the colours of the prestigious Bauman Moscow State Technical University, of which all three are graduates. It\u2019s 2am on Sunday in Ukraine. Here\u2019s a summary of the developments that were seen so far today: Poland has proposed that the EU implement a total ban on trade with Russia, the country\u2019s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said. Russia said it had used hypersonic weapons, which travel fast enough to evade detection by missile defence systems, to destroy an underground military depot in western Ukraine. Residents of Mariupol have been taken to Russia, where they have been \u201credirected\u201d to remote cities in the country, the Mariupol city council has reported. Boris Johnson has come under heavy criticism for comparing the struggle of Ukrainians fighting to the British public voting for Brexit. Kyiv officials have reported that 228 people, including four children, have been killed in Ukraine\u2019s capitol. Ukraine\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs reported that 14,400 Russian personnel have been killed since the start of the war. Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for \u201cmeaningful, fair\u201d peace talks to take place urgently. He told Moscow that Russian losses would otherwise be so huge it would take generations to recover. \u201cNegotiations on peace, on security for us, for Ukraine \u2013 meaningful, fair and without delay \u2013 are the only chance for Russia to reduce the damage from its own mistakes,\u201d he said. Zelenskiy also urged Switzerland to crack down on Russian oligarchs who he said are helping to wage war on Ukraine from the safety of \u201cbeautiful Swiss towns\u201d. The southern city of Zaporizhzhia entered a 38-hour curfew beginning at 1400 GMT on Saturday (1600 local time) after the Ukrainian military ordered people to stay home until early on Monday. Aid agencies are being prevented from reaching people trapped in Ukrainian cities surrounded by Russian forces, the World Food Programme said. Ukraine may not produce enough crops to export if this year\u2019s sowing season is disrupted by Russia\u2019s invasion, the presidential adviser Oleh Ustenko has said. Ten humanitarian corridors were agreed on with Russia for the evacuation of citizens, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has said. My colleague Helen Davidson is taking things over from here. Stay tuned for more live updates. The Guardian\u2019s Moscow correspondents Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer wrote about why public support for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is still high, despite hopes from the West that it is waning: There have been efforts from abroad to encourage the Russian people to protest against the war. Former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger last week released a nine-minute video in which he recalled his admiration for the Soviet weightlifter Yuri Vlasov and his father\u2019s shame at fighting for the Nazi army at Leningrad. \u201cThis is not the Russian people\u2019s war,\u201d he said in an appeal to ordinary Russians. But others in Russia say it is. Many supporters cite the eight-year-old war between Ukraine and Russian proxy forces in Donbas, using words such as genocide and comparisons to the second world war to justify the invasion. As one former diplomat wrote in a WhatsApp message, he looks forward to Russia holding a \u201cNuremberg 2.0\u201d in Ukraine after the war. \u201cAren\u2019t you sad for the children killed in Donbas?\u201d Elizaveta from Moscow shot back when asked about her views on the invasion. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you write about them instead?\u201d Russian society is deeply polarised between supporters and opponents of the Kremlin. Those camps have carried this division over into support for and opposition to the war, experts said. Even simple choices such as whether to call the conflict a \u201cwar\u201d or the state-sanctioned \u201cmilitary operation\u201d carry political meaning. \u201cWe are seeing that society is divided by a majority that broadly supports the war and a minority that is against it,\u201d said Sergei Belanovsky, a sociologist. \u201cThese two groups live in different worlds, and cannot convince each other that their viewpoint is the right one.\u201d According to the state-run Russian Public Opinion Research Center, 71% of Russians \u201csupport Russia\u2019s decision to hold a special military operation in Ukraine\u201d. Valery Fyodorov, head of the polling centre, said that new data to be published by the centre this week would show an increase in support for the \u201cmilitary operation\u201d. The most recent intelligence update from the UK Ministry of Defence says that Russia has still failed to gain control of Ukrainian airspace, one of its main objectives. \u201cTheir continued failure to do so has significantly blunted their operational progress,\u201d reads the statement. Kyiv Independent is reporting that a Russian diplomat made vague comments about Russia having plans to confront NATO on Bosnian TV. Residents of Mariupol, which is being continuously bombed by Russia, have been taken to Russia over the last week, the Mariupol city council is reporting. The council said that \u201cseveral thousand Mariupol residents were deported to Russia. The occupiers illegally removed people from the Left Bank district and shelters in the building of the sports club, where more than a thousand people (mostly women and children) were hiding from constant bombing,\u201d the statement reads. The council said that the residents were taken to \u201cfiltration camps, where occupiers checked people\u2019s phones and documents\u201d. After, residents were \u201credirected to remote cities in Russia, the fate of other remain unknown\u201d. Ukrainian forces have defeated Russia in its initial campaign of the war, according to analysis from DC-based think tank Institute of the Study of War, ultimately leading to a stalemate between the two counties. The institute describes Russia\u2019s strategy as using \u201cairborne and mechanized operations to seize Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odessa and other major Ukrainian cities\u201d. \u201cRussian forces continue to make limited advances in some parts of the theater but are very unlikely to be able to seize their objectives in this way,\u201d the analysis reads. The fall of Mariupol is \u201cunlikely\u201d to change the outcome of the initial campaign dramatically. The analysis notes that the Russia military continues to focus on localized fighting rather than launching large-scale operations. It concludes that there is a stalemate throughout most of Ukraine that, if continued, will \u201clikely be very violent and bloody\u201d. The Kyiv Independent reported today that Russia is illegally forcing untrained men living in the Russian-controlled Donbas region to fight and putting them on the frontlines. \u201cThese people have never even held a machine gun in their hands,\u201d said Oleksii, a 24-year-old resident of Russian-occupied Khrestivka in Donetsk, speaking of friends, classmates and former colleagues that he knows have been conscripted. One Donbas resident named Anastasia told the news outlet that these civilians from Donbas are forced to serve in frontline positions, with Russian forces threatening to shoot them if they don\u2019t comply. Journalist Neil Hauer, a freelancer journalist reporting in Kyiv, has an interesting Twitter thread about the intensifying anti-Russian sentiment among Ukrainians that is directed at the average Russian, not just Vladimir Putin. A video of a police officer in Mariupol, where fighting has been intensifying, is starting to circulate. The officer, Michail Vershnin, directs his pleas to Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron, saying that his city has been \u201cwiped off the face of the earth\u201d. \u201cChildren, elderly people are dying. The city is destroyed and it has been wiped off the face of the earth,\u201d he said in Russian in the video filmed on Friday. \u201cYou have promised that there will be help, give us that help. Biden, Macron, you are great leaders. Be them to the end,\u201d he said. The frontman of one of Ukrainian\u2019s biggest bands, BoomBox, went viral at the beginning of the war with an Instagram video of him singing a Ukrainian freedom fighter song. Reposted on Twitter by Buzzfeed journalist Christopher Miller, Andriy Khlyvnyuk can be seen in uniform with a rifle. Instead of going on a US and Canadian tour, Khlyvnyuk, like many Ukrainian celebrities, chose to stay in his country to fight. \u201cThis is my duty. Ukraine is my home,\u201d Khlyvnyuk told Buzzfeed\u2019s Miller. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not that easy to push me out of my home.\u201d Kyiv officials have just said that 228 people, including four children, have been killed in the Ukrainian capital since the invasion began. Earlier today, Ukraine\u2019s foreign affairs ministry reported about 14,400 Russian personnel killed as of Saturday. This is Lauren Aratani in New York taking over for Nadeem Badshah. Earlier today, Pope Francis paid a visit to a ward in the Bambino Gesu Children\u2019s Hospital in Rome that is treating Ukrainian refugee children. The children are undergoing treatment for illnesses like cancer or neurological diseases, according to the Catholic News Agency. The hospital has treated 50 Ukrainian children since the start of the war, including 19 children who were brought in for treatment on Saturday. In a message to a gathering of European Catholic representatives yesterday, the Pope denounced the \u201cperverse abuse of power\u201d in Ukraine and said that Ukrainians have been attacked in their \u201cidentity, history and tradition\u201d and are \u201cdefending their land\u201d. While the Pope clearly denounced the war, he did not speak of Russia as an aggressor during his speech. Two weeks ago, Alani Iyanuoluwa fled Kyiv as the Russian invasion intensified. Making her way across Europe, the 24-year-old hoped to be reunited with family in London. Yet for 10 days she has been stranded in a French port \u2013 because she is Nigerian. Iyanuoluwa is among a growing number of refugees who claim the British government is ignoring black people who fled Ukraine. Their experiences have again raised the issue of race and the UK\u2019s welcome to refugees, prompting claims that ministers would never have unveiled last week\u2019s humanitarian sponsorship scheme for Ukrainians had it not been aimed at white Europeans. Boris Johnson has been criticised for comparing the struggle of Ukrainians fighting the Russian invasion to British people voting for Brexit. In his speech to the Conservative spring conference in Blackpool, Johnson said it is the \u201cinstinct of the people of this country, like the people of Ukraine, to choose freedom\u201d, with the Brexit vote a \u201cfamous recent example\u201d. The comparison was condemned by Tory peer Lord Barwell, who pointed out Ukraine is seeking to join the EU. Writing on Twitter, he said: \u201cApart from the bit where voting in a free and fair referendum isn\u2019t in any way comparable with risking your life to defend your country against invasion + the awkward fact the Ukrainians are fighting for the freedom to join the EU, this comparison is bang on.\u201d Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the Prime Minister \u201cis a national embarrassment\u201d, adding: \u201cTo compare a referendum to women and children fleeing (Vladimir) Putin\u2019s bombs is an insult to every Ukrainian. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said: \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s comments comparing Ukraine\u2019s life-threatening situation with Brexit was crass and distasteful, and shows just how dangerously obsessed the Tories are with Brexit.\u201d Read our full story here: The governor of Ukraine\u2019s southern Mykolaiv region said rescue work was ongoing at the site of an air strike on a facility where Ukrainian soldiers had been sleeping. Speaking on national television, governor Vitaliy Kim said the attack took place on Friday but gave no further detail about the location or the number of possible casualties. Local media reported the strike hit a barracks in the regional capital, Reuter reports. Ukrainian mothers and their young children found shelter in an ornate theatre in the Polish border town of Przemysl on Saturday, Reuters reports. For Tanya, a 34-year-old from Berdychiv in northern Ukraine, it was a relief to finally have some help with her five young children after their long trip to Poland. Tanya, who did not give her last name, had stayed in her home until it was no longer possible to shield her children from the war. \u201cI tried to protect them from all of this. When the alarm sounded, I covered the windows with blankets so one couldn\u2019t hear it. My small ones made up a monster, the siren monster,\u201d she said. Her children ran around her as she stood inside the theatre, which is tucked inside the Polish city\u2019s Ukrainian cultural centre. There were about 50 refugees sleeping side by side under borrowed blankets on fold-out cots in the theatre. The UK\u2019s transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has said another plane has been grounded because of possible links to Russia. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged Switzerland to crack down on Russian oligarchs who he said were helping to wage war on his country from the safety of \u201cbeautiful Swiss towns\u201d. In an audiolink address to thousands attending an anti-war protest in Bern, Zelenskiy thanked Switzerland for its support since Russia launched its invasion, but speaking through a translator he also said: Your banks are where the money of the people who unleashed this war lies. That is painful. That is also a fight against evil, that their accounts are frozen. That would also be a fight, and you can do this. Ukrainians feel what it is when cities are destroyed. They are being destroyed on the orders of people who live in European, in beautiful Swiss towns, who enjoy property in your cities. It would really be good to strip them of this privilege. Switzerland, which is not a member of the EU, has fully adopted the bloc\u2019s sanctions against Russian individuals and entities, including orders to freeze their wealth in Swiss banks. Ukraine has evacuated 190,000 civilians from frontline areas via humanitarian corridors since the start of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reports. The country\u2019s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said corridors in the Kyiv and Luhansk regions were functioning on Saturday, but a planned corridor to the besieged eastern port city of Mariupol was only partially operational, with Russian troops not allowing buses through. Poland has proposed that the EU implement a total ban on trade with Russia, the country\u2019s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said. Boris Johnson has spoken of the beginning of a \u201cnew age of intimidation\u201d stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea if Vladimir Putin succeeds in his invasion of Ukraine. Russia said it had used hypersonic weapons, which travel fast enough to evade detection by missile defence systems, to destroy an underground military depot in western Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for \u201cmeaningful, fair\u201d peace talks to take place urgently. He told Moscow that Russian losses would otherwise be so huge it would take generations to recover. \u201cNegotiations on peace, on security for us, for Ukraine \u2013 meaningful, fair and without delay \u2013 are the only chance for Russia to reduce the damage from its own mistakes,\u201d he said. The southern city of Zaporizhzhia entered a 38-hour curfew beginning at 1400 GMT on Saturday (1600 local time) after the Ukrainian military ordered people to stay home until early on Monday. Aid agencies are being prevented from reaching people trapped in Ukrainian cities surrounded by Russian forces, the World Food Programme said. Ukraine may not produce enough crops to export if this year\u2019s sowing season is disrupted by Russia\u2019s invasion, the presidential adviser Oleh Ustenko has said. Ten humanitarian corridors were agreed on with Russia for the evacuation of citizens, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has said. My colleague Nadeem Badshah will be taking over this liveblog shortly. From CNN anchor and chief national security correspondent Jim Sciutto: Russia\u2019s defence ministry said on Saturday it had destroyed a large underground depot for missiles and aircraft ammunition in Ukraine\u2019s Ivano-Frankivsk region, the Interfax news agency reported. Russia\u2019s deployment of hypersonic missiles was a warning to Ukraine and the west that it \u201chas the means to escalate\u201d the conflict further, defence expert Dr James Bosbotinis said. Russia\u2019s space agency has rejected western media reports suggesting Russian cosmonauts joining the International Space Station (ISS) wore wear yellow suits with a blue accents in support of Ukraine. \u201cSometimes yellow is just yellow,\u201d Roscosmos\u2019 press service said on its Telegram channel. \u201cThe flight suits of the new crew are made in the colours of the emblem of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University, which all three cosmonauts graduated from ... To see the Ukrainian flag everywhere and in everything is crazy.\u201d When asked about the suits during a live-streamed news conference from the ISS on Friday, mission commander Oleg Artemyev said: \u201cEvery crew picks a colour that looks different. It was our turn to pick a colour. The truth is, we had accumulated a lot of yellow fabric, so we needed to use it up. That\u2019s why we had to wear yellow flight suits.\u201d Activists in Kazakhstan have said they were refused permission to hold a protest against Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, according to AFP. Kazakhstan is seeking a third way amid the war in Ukraine, attempting to distance itself from the Kremlin\u2019s actions while not antagonising Moscow. The foreign ministry last month signalled its neutrality in the conflict over Ukraine, saying it is not considering recognition of two Russia-backed separatist entities in eastern Ukraine. Although Kazakh authorities permitted activists in the former capital Almaty to hold a rally of more than 2,000 people demonstrating against the invasion earlier this month, they were blocked from putting on a second rally. Authorities in the country strictly control demonstrations, only allowing them to take place in designated locations with permission. Activists showed AFP a letter from the Almaty mayor\u2019s office refusing them permission to hold a second demonstration, explaining a square designated for demonstrations was being used for a rally in support of Kazakhstan\u2019s President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev instead. \u201cIn reality they only held (the demonstration) to prevent us from holding our anti-war meeting,\u201d activist Alnur Ilyashev told AFP, explaining they had \u201cbooked\u201d the square for the whole day, meaning it would not be free for other rallies even after they left. Russia\u2019s deployment of hypersonic missiles was a warning to Ukraine and the west that it \u201chas the means to escalate\u201d the conflict further, a defence expert has said. Dr James Bosbotinis, a specialist in defence and international affairs, told the BBC it was not possible for the Ukrainian army to defend itself against attacks by these missiles. \u201cThe speed of the Kinzhal puts it beyond the reach of any Ukrainian air defence system and the launch platforms can launch from ranges beyond the reach of Ukraine,\u201d he said, adding that the hypersonic missile was probably launched from southern Russia. Bosbotinis said hitting the \u201chigh-value target\u201d of an underground military depot was \u201csending the message to Ukraine that Russia has the means to escalate this conflict further ... It\u2019s also a warning to the west that Russia can of course, up the ante in Ukraine and the Kinzhal could also be deployed if the war escalated and drew in external powers.\u201d He said it was \u201cmessaging\u201d that Russia could hit targets in other parts of Europe. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called for \u201cmeaningful and fair\u201d peace talks over Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \u201cIt\u2019s time to meet. Time to talk. It is time to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine. Otherwise Russia\u2019s losses will be so huge that several generations will not be enough to rebound.\u201d \u201cThe war must end,\u201d he added. \u201cUkraine\u2019s proposals are on the table.\u201d The Czech prime minister, Petr Fiala, has said his country will take care of the \u201cwives and children\u201d fleeing Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which has driven about 3 million Ukrainians to seek refuge in the EU\u2019s eastern flank. Fiala, who travelled to Kyiv earlier this week with his Polish and Slovenian counterparts to meet Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, added that the Czech Republic could cope with further refugee arrivals from Ukraine. With men of conscription age prevented from leaving Ukraine, mostly women and children have crossed into the European Union at border points in Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. \u201cI have informed Ukrainian friends that we will take care of their wives and children,\u201d Fiala said on Twitter. \u201cThe speed and size of the refugee wave is incomparable with past waves but the Czech Republic can (handle) it.\u201d Echoing the concerns of other leaders in the region, Fiala said countries receiving large numbers of refugees should receive EU financial support but voiced opposition to quotas. \u201cWe do not want the EU to introduce quotas but to have financial solidarity with the countries most affected by the refugee wave,\u201d he said. Poland, which shares a roughly 500km (310-mile) border with Ukraine, has received more than 2 million of the refugee arrivals. The deputy mayor of Przemy\u015bl, a town near Poland\u2019s busiest crossing with Ukraine, said the flow of refugees had eased, but cautioned that further Russian military attacks in western Ukraine could change the situation quickly. \u201cMost of the people who left eastern Ukraine are now in western Ukraine waiting for further developments,\u201d the deputy mayor Bogus\u0142aw \u015awie\u017cy said. \u201cAny nervousness occurring in western Ukraine will result in an increase in the stream of people coming to Poland.\u201d Boris Johnson said it was a \u201ctragedy\u201d that the lack of democracy in Russia meant Vladimir Putin was not challenged as he launched his \u201cdisastrous\u201d invasion. Johnson said: I don\u2019t believe that democratic freedoms are going to sprout any time soon in the Kremlin, far from it. But with every day that passes I think that Putin becomes a more glaring advertisement for the system that he hates and despises, and it becomes ever more obvious why we have to stick up for Ukraine. The prime minister said that \u201cif Putin had a free press, if he had the BBC on his case ... whatever you may think, he would have known the truth \u2013 or a version of it\u201d. As Tory activists laughed at the jibe aimed at the BBC, Johnson continued: If he had free, impartial responsible journalism, let me put it that way, then he would have known the truth that the Ukrainians are a proud, proud nation with a charismatic leader. And he would have known, before he set out on this disastrous and inhuman venture, that they would fight to defend their homeland, he would have known that. In a real democracy Putin would not have \u201clocked himself in this echo chamber of sycophants\u201d because he would have to face a \u201creal parliament with real backbenchers\u201d who had to face an electorate. In those circumstances \u201cI don\u2019t believe that he would have been capable of such a crescendo of disastrous and self-destructive mistakes,\u201d Johnson added. Ukraine may not produce enough crops to export if this year\u2019s sowing campaigns are disrupted by Russia\u2019s invasion, the presidential adviser Oleh Ustenko has said. \u201cUkraine has enough grain and food reserves to survive for a year, but if the war continues ... [Ukraine] will not be able to export grain to the world, and there will be problems,\u201d he said, adding that Ukraine is the world\u2019s fifth-largest wheat exporter. Boris Johnson thanked the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, for urging him to \u201cread Putin\u2019s crazy essay\u201d several months ago, ahead of the invasion. He said the pair, along with the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, spoke daily about the situation in Ukraine. \u201cWe are talking continuously, Liz, Ben and I, to our colleagues in the Ukraine support group to discuss what more we can do. And those conversations are literally every day and there will be more,\u201d he told the Conservative conference. He said he was \u201cproud\u201d of what the UK did on sanctions, adding: \u201cWe must sanction more banks and individuals than any other European country ... there is, of course, a cost to all these actions. Of course there is. But the cost of doing nothing will be far higher.\u201d He described Putin as a \u201ca backstreet pusher, feeding addiction, creating dependence\u201d on Russia\u2019s gas and oil. \u201cPutin\u2019s war is intended to cause economic damage to the west and to benefit him,\u201d he told the conference. He knows that with every dollar increase in the price of a barrel of oil, he gets billions more in revenues from the sales of either oil and gas, and that\u2019s the tragedy of the situation. Now he wants to weaken the collective will to resist by pushing up the cost of living, hitting us at the pumps and in our fuel bills, so we must respond. A \u201cnew age of intimidation\u201d stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea looms if Vladimir Putin succeeds in his invasion of Ukraine, Boris Johnson has warned. Johnson said the world was at a \u201cturning point\u201d: The end of freedom in Ukraine will mean the extinction of any hope of freedom in Georgia and then Moldova. It will mean the beginning of a new age of intimidation across the whole of Eastern Europe from the Baltic to the Black Sea. If Putin succeeding crushing Ukraine, it will be the green light for autocrats everywhere in the Middle East, in the Far East. This is a turning point for the world. It\u2019s a moment of choice. It\u2019s a choice between freedom and oppression. He warned other leaders against adopting a stance of \u201crealpolitik\u201d towards Putin. \u201cI know there are some others around the world who say it\u2019s better to make accommodation with tyranny. I believe they are profoundly wrong,\u201d Johnson said. To try to normalise relations with Putin after this, as the west had done in 2014 after the annexation of Crimea, would be to make exactly the same mistake again, he added. Vladimir Putin made a \u201ccatastrophic mistake\u201d in invading Ukraine, Boris Johnson has said. Speaking at the Conservative party conference in Blackpool, the UK prime minister said the country stood with the people of Ukraine. \u201cWith every day that Ukraine\u2019s heroic resistance continues, it is clear that Putin has made a catastrophic mistake,\u201d he said. Johnson questioned why Putin had launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, rejecting the idea that it was over concerns about the country joining Nato. \u201cHe was frightened of Ukraine, because in Ukraine, they have a free press. And in Ukraine, they had free elections and with every year Ukraine has progressed, not always easily, towards freedom and democracy and open markets, he feared the Ukrainian example, and he feared the implicit reproach to himself,\u201d Johnson said. The prime minister contrasted this with the situation in Russia. \u201cIn Putin\u2019s Russia, you get jailed for 15 years just for calling an invasion an invasion. And if you stand against Putin in an election, you get poisoned or shot.\u201d He said Putin felt threatened by Ukraine because the two countries had been \u201cso historically close\u201d. It is vital that Moscow\u2019s invasion fails, Johnson said, because \u201ca victorious Putin will not stop in Ukraine\u201d. Aid agencies are being prevented from reaching people trapped in Ukrainian cities surrounded by Russian forces, the World Food Programme has said. The UN agency\u2019s emergency coordinator, Jakob Kern, told AFP that \u201cthe challenge is to get to the cities that are encircled or about to be encircled\u201d, describing the situation as dire. He said it has been almost impossible to deliver emergency supplies to the besieged port city of Mariupol or the north-eastern cities of Kharkiv and Sumy. He said it was a tactic that was unacceptable in the 21st century. Replacing broken food supply chains amid fighting is a \u201cmammoth task\u201d, he said. The WFP is aiming to reach 3.1 million people in Ukraine, but efforts have been hindered by difficulties in finding willing truck drivers. Hundreds of thousands of women and children are among those trapped. \u201cThe closer you go to these cities, the more worried they are about their safety,\u201d Kern said. \u201cAnd that means we\u2019re not able to reach these people in Mariupol, Sumy, Kharkiv, in the cities that are almost encircled by now - or completely in the case of Mariupol.\u201d Three Russian cosmonauts have arrived at the International Space Station wearing yellow flight suits with blue accents \u2013 the colours of the Ukrainian flag: A total of 816 Ukrainian civilians have been confirmed to have been killed and 1,333 injured since the Russian invasion began on 24 February, according to the UN human rights office. However, as it only reports counts that it can verify, it believes the figures vastly understate the actual toll. Ukrainian officials say thousands have been killed. The Associated Press reports that the office of the country\u2019s prosecutor general said that a total of 112 children have been killed since the start of the fighting. More than 140 children have been wounded. The UK Home Office has said 8,600 visas had been granted under the family scheme for Ukrainians fleeing the war by 5pm on Friday. The announcement comes amid frustration with the length of time the Home Office is taking to process visas. At least 43,000 have applied for Ukraine family scheme visas and are waiting for their applications to be approved, with many staying in hotels in countries bordering Ukraine. Poland has proposed that the European Union implement a total ban on trade with Russia, the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said in a statement reported by Reuters. Poland is proposing to add a trade blockade to this package of sanctions as soon as possible, [including] both of its seaports ... but also a ban on land trade. Fully cutting off Russia\u2019s trade would further force Russia to consider whether it would be better to stop this cruel war,\u201d Morawiecki said. Poland\u2019s call for Moscow to face tougher economic repercussions for its invasion of Ukraine comes after EU member states agreed on a fourth package of sanctions against Russia this week. Details were not disclosed, but the French presidency said Russia\u2019s \u201cmost-favoured nation\u201d trade status would be revoked. Street fighting in the centre of Mariupol is preventing the rescue of hundreds of civilians trapped in the basement of a theatre that Ukrainian officials say was bombed by Russia on Wednesday, according to the city\u2019s mayor. Vadym Boychenko told the BBC that rescue teams could help people out of the wreckage only during periods when the fighting subsided. \u201cThere are tanks ... and artillery shelling, and all kinds of weapons fired in the area,\u201d he told the broadcaster. \u201cOur forces are doing everything they can to hold their position in the city, but the forces of the enemy are larger than ours, unfortunately.\u201d On Friday, Mariupol authorities said 130 had escaped but that more than 1,000 remained in the theatre\u2019s basement. Russia denies bombing the theatre. The Ukrainian army has not observed any significant shifts in the past 24 hours in front line areas, the presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych has said in a statement reported by Reuters. Fighting continues, Arestovych said in an online video address. He named the following as hotspots for the Russian offensive: The south-eastern city of Mariupol The southern cities of Mykolaiv and Kherson The eastern town of Izyum The former head of the British armed forces has backed calls for Vladimir Putin to face a \u201cNuremberg-type trial\u201d due to Russia\u2019s \u201cmorally indefensible tactic\u201d of attacking Ukrainian civilians. Discussing the role of morale plays in wars, Lord Richard Dannatt told BBC Breakfast that it had a \u201chuge bearing on what happens on the ground\u201d. He said: When we talk about fighting power, there are three components \u2013 there\u2019s the physical component (the tanks, the aircraft, the equipment), there\u2019s the conceptual components (the plans the generals come up with) but then there\u2019s the morale component \u2013 that\u2019s the will of the soldiers to fight. He contrasted the situation that Russian troops had been led to expect when they invaded Ukraine with the reality. \u201cWe understand that they were briefed really poorly, that they would go, that they\u2019d be moving quickly, they\u2019d be welcomed as peacekeepers and liberators, but in fact what they found was that the Ukrainian armed forces, Ukrainian civilians were fighting resolutely against them. These young men are absolutely confused, many of them are very young, frightened, exhausted from weeks of exercising.\u201d The morale of Russian troops had been further weakened by a failure in the army\u2019s logistics systems, Dannatt said: These young men, not only frightened, are now hungry, the fuel for their tanks is not available, so they\u2019ve been placed in a terrible situation. It\u2019s therefore no surprise the Russian army has not made progress on the ground. They\u2019ve had to resort now to this morally indefensible tactic of shelling defenceless civilians.\u201d Dannatt agreed with calls from Gordon Brown and others for Putin to not only be indicted, but for \u201ca Nuremberg-type trial to be set up, to absolutely condemn, for all time, into the history books, what Putin and his generals have been doing\u201d. Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine after failing to \u201cfatally weaken\u201d the country with its annexation of Crimea and war in the Donbas, the UK\u2019s former ambassador to Ukraine has said. Appearing on BBC Breakfast, Simon Smith discussed the \u201cbackground\u201d to Putin\u2019s \u201cfull-scale\u201d invasion of Ukraine, saying: I think in 2013-14, a lot of us saw what Russia was doing then as a start of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine \u2013 it isn\u2019t a war that just started in February this year. Because what Putin was after in annexing Crimea and instigating the war in the Donbas was fatally weakening Ukraine, inflicting such damage on Ukraine, damaging its systems and institutions, damaging its confidence to an extent that Ukraine would not be fit to operate as a viable sovereign country. What we saw in the 7-8 years following, was the fact that Putin failed in that objective, that Ukraine did remarkably well in staying on its feet, reforming a lot of institutions and actually making itself a more viable and successful country. Here are some images from the past 24 hours. In Lviv on Friday, prams were arranged in neat rows across Rynok Square, in a display that symbolised the tragic cost of the war. The prams represent each of the 109 children Ukrainian officials say have died so far in Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. In Kyiv, officials said on Friday that 222 people had been killed in the capital, including 60 civilians and four children. More than 3.2 million have left Ukraine since the start of the war. Many - more than 2 million - have travelled to Poland, according to UNHCR. On Friday, families queued for food near the Central Station in Warsaw. Christine Goyer, the UN refugee agency\u2019s Representative in Poland, said there had been a \u201ctremendous effort from the people, local communities, municipalities and government of Poland in receiving and hosting new arrivals.\u201d On Friday night in Moscow, Vladimir Putin praised Russian \u201cunity\u201d over what the Kremlin is calling its special operation in Ukraine, during a rare public speech. His five-minute address at the Luzhniki stadium was, however, cut short due to a \u201ctechnical failure\u201d and so re-aired from start. Many attending the Moscow rally were seen waving flags emblazoned with the letter Z, a military marking that has become a symbol of support for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The southern city of Zaporizhzhia will be under a 38-hour curfew beginning at 2pm GMT on Saturday (4pm local time) after the Ukrainian military ordered people to stay home until early on Monday, the deputy mayor Anatoliy Kurtiev said in a statement reported by Reuters. \u201cDo not go outside at this time!\u201d he said in an online post. The city has become an important route for some of the 35,000 people estimated to have escaped the siege of Mariupol. Ten humanitarian corridors have been agreed on with Russian for the evacuation of citizens, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has said. Reuters reports that Vereshchuk said a corridor had been agreed for the besieged city of Mariupol, although the authorities\u2019 previous efforts to evacuate civilians there under a temporary ceasefire have mostly failed, with both sides trading blame. About 350,000 civilians are stranded in the city with little food or water. Several corridors have also been agreed in Kyiv and in the Luhansk region. Russia said it had used hypersonic weapons - which travel so fast they can evade detection by missile defence systems - to destory an underground military depot in western Ukraine. The claim has not been verified. In a video address the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said \u201cmeaningful, fair\u201d peace talks were needed urgently. He warned Moscow that Russian losses will otherwise be so huge it will take generations to recover. \u201cNegotiations on peace, on security for us, for Ukraine \u2013 meaningful, fair and without delay \u2013 are the only chance for Russia to reduce the damage from its own mistakes,\u201d he said. The US president, Joe Biden, warned China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, that there will be \u201cimplications and consequences\u201d if Beijing provides material support to Russia as it attacks Ukrainian cities, the White House said. Biden did not make any direct requests to Xi to persuade Putin to end the attack during the two hour call on Friday. On Friday, fighting reached the centre of the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol, where 350,000 civilians have been stranded with little food or water. The Russian defence ministry said its forces were \u201ctightening the noose\u201d around the port city, and that \u201cfighting against nationalists\u201d was taking place in the city centre. Mariupol\u2019s mayor, Vadym Boichenko, appeared to confirm the claim. Ukraine\u2019s defence ministry said it had \u201ctemporarily\u201d lost access to the Azov Sea, which opens to the Black Sea and would be a major blow for Ukraine. More than 130 people have been rescued following a Russian airstrike on a Mariupol theatre that was sheltering hundreds of civilians. Speaking in the early hours of Saturday, Zelenskiy said there was no new information regarding fatalities. The city was experiencing \u201cthe greatest ordeal in its history, in the history of Ukraine\u201d, he said. There were also reports on Friday of mass casualties after a missile attack on a Ukrainian army barracks in the southern city of Mykolaiv. The Institute of the Study of War said Russian forces continued to secure territorial gains only around Mariupol on Friday and that Russian forces face growing morale and supply problems. Russian attempts to surround Kyiv and Mykolaiv have been pushed back, according to the UK, which said heavy Russian shelling of encircled cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol has continued. Six and a half million people are currently displaced within Ukraine, according to the UN. The World Food Programme has warned Ukraine\u2019s food supply chains are breaking down, with many grocery stores and warehouses now empty. There have been 816 confirmed civilian deaths, according to the UN. Kyiv officials said 222 people had been killed in the capital, including 60 civilians and four children. I\u2019m now handing over to my colleague in London, Clea Skopeliti. Ukraine\u2019s general staff of the armed forces has said that Russian lieutenant General Andrei Mordvichev, commander of the 8th Combined Arms Army of the Southern Military District of the Russian Armed Forces was killed during fighting. The claim has not been verified. Ukraine has also said its anti-aircraft defences have hit 12 Russian targets: two planes, three helicopters, three drones and four cruise missiles. Russia has said it has used hypersonic weapons to destory an underground military depot in western Ukraine. Hypersonic missiles are fast weapons that can evade detection by missile defence systems. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said on Saturday it had destroyed a large underground depot for missiles and aircraft ammunition in Ukraine\u2019s Ivano-Frankivsk region, the Interfax news agency reported. The ministry said it had also destroyed Ukrainian military radio and reconnaissance centres near the port city of Odessa using a coastal missile system, according to Interfax, which was cited by a Reuters report. These claims have not been independently verified. The UK Ministry of Defence says the Kremlin has \u201cso far failed to achieve its original objectives\u201d and has been \u201csurprised by the scale and ferocity of the Ukrainian resistance\u201d. In its latest intelligence update, the UK MoD says Russia has been forced to change its operational approach and is now pursuing a strategy of attrition. \u201cThis is likely to involve the indiscriminate use of firepower resulting in increased civilian casualties, destruction of Ukrainian infrastructure, and intensify the humanitarian crisis,\u201d it warns. According to the UN, 816 civilians are confirmed to have been killed since the conflict began, while 1,333 people have been wounded, mostly from explosive weapons. Kyiv officials said yesterday that 222 people had been killed in the capital, including 60 civilians and four children. Serhiy Gaiday, governor of Ukraine\u2019s Luhansk region, has said a humanitarian corridor for evacuation will be open on Saturday. He said a \u201cregime of silence\u201d has been agreed from 9am Kyiv time, according to Reuters. That\u2019s about 40 minutes from now. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida will push for a unified international response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine when he meets Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Saturday. Here is some further detail from Reuters: \u201cSince the Russian invasion of Ukraine coincides with this trip, I\u2019d like to emphasise the importance of international unity and confirm that Japan and India will work together on various issues,\u201d Kishida said ahead of his visit. India and Japan are party to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), a security framework that also includes the United States and Australia. Japan has imposed sanctions on dozens of Russian individuals and organisations since the Ukraine invasion that began on Feb. 24 and has been receiving Ukrainian refugees. India, however, is the only one of the four Quad members that has not condemned the invasion. Kishida will also aim to reinforce security and economic ties with India, the world\u2019s second most populous country and Asia\u2019s third-largest economy. At least 40 Ukrainian soldiers were killed following a Russian air strike on an army barracks in the southern city of Mykolaiv on Friday, according to local media reports cited by AFP. The mayor of Mykolaiv Oleksandr Senkevich said on Facebook on Friday that several villages in the region had been occupied and the city had been under heavy fire, calling it a \u201cdifficult day\u201d. In the early hours of Saturday, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy released a video address in which he told Moscow that now was the time for urgent peace talks, warning that Russian losses will otherwise be so huge it will take generations to recover. Here are some of the key points from his speech: Russia has continued to block the supply of aid to besieged cities \u201cin most areas\u201d Zelenskiy said that on Friday there were seven humanitarian corridors in Ukraine. Six in the Sumy region, one in the Donetsk region. More than 9,000 people were evacuated from the besieged Mariupol, he said, and hundreds of tons of essential products were delivered. But he added: \u201cThe occupiers continue to block the supply of humanitarian aid to the besieged cities in most areas. This is a totally deliberate tactic. They have a clear order to do absolutely everything to make the humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities an \u2018argument\u2019 for Ukrainians to cooperate with the occupiers. This is a war crime.\u201d No new information on fatalities following a Russian airstrike on a theatre in Mariupol Zelenskiy said people were being rescued from the rubble, and that more than 130 people had been rescued so far. \u201cSome of them are seriously wounded. But at the moment there is no information about the dead,\u201d he said. Hundreds of civilians were sheltering in the theatre. He thanked those defending Mariupol, saying the city was experiencing \u201cthe greatest ordeal in its history, in the history of Ukraine.\u201d Russian forces had been stopped \u201cin almost all directions\u201d Zelenskiy said Russian forces were halted across many areas of the country. He said there was heavy fighting in the Kharkiv region, especially near Izyum, but that Russian troops were unprepared. \u201cMeaningful, fair\u201d negotiations were urgently needed Zelenskiy told Moscow: \u201cIt\u2019s time to meet. Time to talk. It is time to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine. Otherwise Russia\u2019s losses will be so huge that several generations will not be enough to rebound.\u201d He said: \u201cNegotiations on peace, on security for us, for Ukraine - meaningful, fair and without delay - are the only chance for Russia to reduce the damage from its own mistakes.\u201d On the international response Zelenskiy said he would continue to appeal to world leaders to call for peace in Ukraine, with plans to address Switzerland, Italy, Israel and Japan. He has spoken with Ukrainian ambassadors around the world \u201cto intensify the supply of humanitarian goods\u201d for displaced people in Ukraine. A coordination headquarters has also been set up to oversee the delivery of humanitarian aid to Ukraine, he said. The Vatican has long played global mediator but has struggled to make its mark in the Ukraine conflict, reports AFP. It is walking a tightrope between the desire for peace and ties with the Russian Orthodox Church. Here is some analysis from AFP: The Argentine pontiff has been forced to perform a diplomatic balancing act. He has been drawn into the conflict as the spiritual guide of five to six million Catholics in Ukraine. But the Vatican has also spent years fostering closer ties with the Russian Orthodox Church led by Patriarch Kirill - a close ally of President Vladimir Putin and a key pillar of his ruling apparatus. This led in 2016 to the historic meeting between Pope Francis and Kirill, the first encounter by the heads of the two churches since Christianity split into Western and Eastern branches in the 11th century. In December, the pontiff even raised the possibility of going to Moscow to meet with this \u201cbrother\u201d Kirill in the near future. Francis \u201cis inevitably considered as both judge and party\u201d in the conflict, noted Bernard Lecomte, a specialist in the Vatican and eastern Europe. The result has been a series of public statements by the pope condemning the war in increasingly emotive terms - without ever mentioning Russia as the aggressor. Hello it\u2019s Rebecca Ratcliffe, bringing you all the latest developments unfolding in Ukraine. It\u2019s 7.20am in Ukraine. Here\u2019s where things stand: US president, Joe Biden, warned China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, that there will be \u201cimplications and consequences\u201d if Beijing provides material support to Russia as it attacks Ukrainian cities, the White House said. Biden did not make any direct requests to Xi to persuade Putin to end the attack during the two hour call on Friday.

Russian forces are \u201cholding captive\u201d a Ukrainian journalist, Victoria Roshchyna, according to the Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske. In a statement, Hromadske said they believe Roshchyna was detained by the Russian FSB around 15 March. Vladimir Putin praised Russian \u201cunity\u201d over what the Kremlin is calling its special operation in Ukraine during a rare public speech at the national stadium in Moscow. As Putin was finishing his speech, the broadcast was suddenly cut off and state television showed patriotic songs. The Kremlin\u2019s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov blamed a \u201ctechnical failure\u201d for the disruption. Zelenskiy said Ukraine expects progress on its EU membership bid within months, following a call with the head of EU executive, Ursula von der Leyen. He also said he would continue to appeal to world leaders to call for peace in Ukraine, with plans to address Switzerland, Italy, Israel and Japan.",

      "bodyText": "Australia has banned the sale of alumina and aluminium ores to Russia in response to what it described as \u201cunrelenting and illegal aggression\u201d towards Ukraine. Also on Sunday, prime minister Scott Morrison announced Australia would donate coal and further military equipment to Ukraine to \u201csupport the brave and courageous resistance\u201d as part of a new aid package that also includes $30m in emergency humanitarian assistance. \u201cRussia must pay a very high price for its brutality. It must pay that price economically, it must pay the price ... in diplomatic terms as well,\u201d Morrison said. It came as foreign minister Marise Payne described Russia\u2019s atrocities in Ukraine as \u201cwar crimes\u201d and said \u201cinnocent civilians and civilian infrastructure\u201d were being targeted. The federal government has been under pressure to stop the export of alumina to Russia, with critics warning it was potentially allowing Australian resources to be used in munitions manufacturing. The government overnight announced it was ceasing all exports of alumina and aluminum ores, including bauxite, to limit Russia\u2019s ability to produce aluminium, a major Russian export and a critical component in arms and munitions. Russia relies on Australia for 20% of its alumina needs. The government said it would work with \u201cexporters and peak bodies that will be affected by the ban to find new [markets] and expand existing markets\u201d. The sanctions are likely to impact Queensland Alumina Ltd (QAL), majority owned by Rio Tinto in a joint venture with Russia\u2019s Rusal International, the second biggest aluminium producer in the world. QAL was affected by sanctions announced last week, which targeted two Russian businessmen, Viktor Vekselberg and Oleg Deripaska. A company founded by Deripaska owns 20% of the QAL, which is a major employer in Gladstone. After the sanctions on Deripaska, the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, an advocacy organisation, called for a complete ban on Rusal exporting Australian alumina to Russia. On Sunday, the centre\u2019s climate and environment director, Dan Gocher, said the ban addressed the concern over Australian alumina being used in Russian arms manufacturing. \u201cThe secondary concern is that Deripaska and Vekselberg still stand to profit from Queensland Alumina,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the government doesn\u2019t sanction Rusal, then Rio Tinto must ensure any profits are quarantined.\u201d Rusal said in a statement that Deripaska had surrendered his majoirty interest and control over Rusal and its parent company, En+, after an agreement with the US Treasury following sanctions in 2019. \u201cPursuant to the agreement with the US Treasury, which removed Mr Deripaska from control of the business, and which remains effective and ongoing, Mr Deripaska cannot receive any type of financial benefit from his minority holding in EN+, RUSAL or any part of the Group and is completely blocked from receiving dividends.\u201d Rusal said Vekselberg was indirectly a minority beneficiary and has no influence on the company\u2019s operations. A spokesman for Rio Tinto said the company had already announced it was in the process of terminating all commercial relationships with any Russian business. \u201cOur priority remains the wellbeing of our people, our communities and the continued safe operation of our businesses, in full compliance with all governmental directions, including the Queensland Alumina Limited joint venture.\u201d The Australian government also announced a new major aid and assistance package to Ukraine. The package included a donation of 70,000 tonnes of thermal coal to assist Ukraine with energy security. The coal will be sourced from Whitehaven Coal, which has arranged the shipment. Australia is working with Ukraine and Poland to deliver the supplies. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cThe assistance will help keep the country\u2019s coal-fired power generators operating and supplying electricity to the country\u2019s power grid, supporting the Ukrainian people by keeping lights on, homes heated and factories running at this very difficult time,\u201d the government said in a statement. The aid package also includes $30m in additional emergency humanitarian assistance and a new humanitarian visa, which will be temporarily available to Ukrainians fleeing the war. The visa allows work, study and access to Medicare for three years. \u201cSince Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine began, the Morrison government has issued almost 4,500 visas to Ukrainians,\u201d the government said. \u201cOver 600 Ukrainians with these visas have arrived and more are coming every day.\u201d Donations to approved charities and not-for-profits supporting Ukrainian refugees will be made tax deductible and Australia will give $10m to the World Food Program to help address food shortages. The measures were welcomed by the Australian Council for International Development, a peak group for the aid sector, who described the intervention as \u201ccritical for the Ukrainian people in their hour of need\u201d. \u201cThis new funding will protect women, children, people with disabilities and the elderly as they flee the violence and destruction,\u201d chief executive Marc Purcell said. Australia has also boosted its military assistance to Ukraine by $21m, taking the total military funding to $91m. The new assistance will include \u201cadditional material from Australian Defence Force stocks\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>It seems hard to credit, but in the days before the likes of Vladimir Putin and P&amp;O Ferries showed their true colours, Uber was regarded by many in London as one of the more suspect foreign arrivals.</p> <p>This week, however, the global ride-hailing firm will once again find out if it is on the naughty step, when its licence to operate in one of its biggest markets comes up for renewal.</p> <p>Its first private hire licence, along with thousands more for its drivers, came without too much fuss in 2012 from Transport for London, who were keen to embrace the latest technology in everything from tickets to traffic lights \u2013 even as the traditional London cabby cried foul at the new US cock of the walk.</p> <p>Renewing that licence has been a different matter. Uber will be hoping this will be the third time lucky, after being knocked back twice in the space of two years and having to suffer the indignity of pleading to a magistrate for a conditional extension.</p> <p>Are they now, in the parlance, \u201cfit and proper\u201d? Few would want to prejudge TfL, whose reasons for turning down Uber in 2017 and 2019 had largely flown under the radar. Beforehand, opponents from the taxi trade had focused on being undercut by lost Prius drivers unable to do a three-point turn, while socially aware campaigners cried foul at Uber\u2019s payment and \u201cpartner\u201d arrangements.</p> <p>Instead, safety and security problems came to the fore. TfL cited Uber\u2019s failure to report alleged offences to the police in 2017. Then, after beefing up reporting protocols, in 2019 Uber was slapped down because drivers had worked under fake identities.</p> <p>Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi had just come in as the new broom after alarming claims of boardroom harassment did for founder Travis Kalanick in 2017. Khosrowshahi flew in to promise mayor Sadiq Khan that the firm would change.</p> <p>If the first instance was a pivotal moment in what might be called new Uber, the repeat treatment provoked some indignation in the San Francisco global HQ. In 2019, Khosrowshahi simply tweeted that TfL\u2019s decision was \u201cjust wrong\u201d, after \u201cfundamental change\u201d.</p> <p>Both times, Uber remained able to operate pending appeals, and no doubt will again should the licence due to expire on 27 March not be renewed.</p> <p>But it will remain an important corporate verdict \u2013 particularly given the wider overtones from Sadiq Khan that Uber had not been \u201cplaying by the rules\u201d.</p> <p>And Uber\u2019s boss for UK and northern Europe, a cycling north Londoner, Jamie Heywood, might feel particularly aggrieved, after introducing schemes to push the uptake of electric vehicles in the capital, and winning the support of the GMB union after concessions on holiday pay for drivers.</p> <p>Uber has backed Khan\u2019s plans to expand the ultra-low emission zone and tried to marry up consumer desire for electric cabs with the reality of drivers \u2013 now finally described as its workforce, rather than partners \u2013 who typically live in flats in east London without the kind of charging infrastructure more swiftly installed in the Tesla-owning boroughs.</p> <p>With rivals such as Bolt now competing directly for passengers and drivers with virtually identical apps, Uber has been the first to change its business model \u2013 admittedly, under legal direction \u2013 to finally acknowledge that the passenger is booking direct with Uber rather than the driver.</p> <p>That has tax implications \u2013 pushing up fares in the UK, at a time when many customers may already be feeling the pinch. According to TfL, the VAT now payable on cab fares is a matter for HMRC and has no bearing on the licence. But Uber is, at least, quickly complying with a condition that will now apply to all.</p> <p>With revenues globally averaging nearly $2bn a month, and offshoots such as food delivery via Uber Eats growing profitable, London and its 50,000 Uber drivers may not be a pivotal part of the business. But global reputation still counts for something \u2013 and an undisputed licence would go some way to wipe the tarnish from the Uber brand.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It seems hard to credit, but in the days before the likes of Vladimir Putin and P&amp;O Ferries showed their true colours, Uber was regarded by many in London as one of the more suspect foreign arrivals. This week, however, the global ride-hailing firm will once again find out if it is on the naughty step, when its licence to operate in one of its biggest markets comes up for renewal. Its first private hire licence, along with thousands more for its drivers, came without too much fuss in 2012 from Transport for London, who were keen to embrace the latest technology in everything from tickets to traffic lights \u2013 even as the traditional London cabby cried foul at the new US cock of the walk. Renewing that licence has been a different matter. Uber will be hoping this will be the third time lucky, after being knocked back twice in the space of two years and having to suffer the indignity of pleading to a magistrate for a conditional extension. Are they now, in the parlance, \u201cfit and proper\u201d? Few would want to prejudge TfL, whose reasons for turning down Uber in 2017 and 2019 had largely flown under the radar. Beforehand, opponents from the taxi trade had focused on being undercut by lost Prius drivers unable to do a three-point turn, while socially aware campaigners cried foul at Uber\u2019s payment and \u201cpartner\u201d arrangements. Instead, safety and security problems came to the fore. TfL cited Uber\u2019s failure to report alleged offences to the police in 2017. Then, after beefing up reporting protocols, in 2019 Uber was slapped down because drivers had worked under fake identities. Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi had just come in as the new broom after alarming claims of boardroom harassment did for founder Travis Kalanick in 2017. Khosrowshahi flew in to promise mayor Sadiq Khan that the firm would change. If the first instance was a pivotal moment in what might be called new Uber, the repeat treatment provoked some indignation in the San Francisco global HQ. In 2019, Khosrowshahi simply tweeted that TfL\u2019s decision was \u201cjust wrong\u201d, after \u201cfundamental change\u201d. Both times, Uber remained able to operate pending appeals, and no doubt will again should the licence due to expire on 27 March not be renewed. But it will remain an important corporate verdict \u2013 particularly given the wider overtones from Sadiq Khan that Uber had not been \u201cplaying by the rules\u201d. And Uber\u2019s boss for UK and northern Europe, a cycling north Londoner, Jamie Heywood, might feel particularly aggrieved, after introducing schemes to push the uptake of electric vehicles in the capital, and winning the support of the GMB union after concessions on holiday pay for drivers. Uber has backed Khan\u2019s plans to expand the ultra-low emission zone and tried to marry up consumer desire for electric cabs with the reality of drivers \u2013 now finally described as its workforce, rather than partners \u2013 who typically live in flats in east London without the kind of charging infrastructure more swiftly installed in the Tesla-owning boroughs. With rivals such as Bolt now competing directly for passengers and drivers with virtually identical apps, Uber has been the first to change its business model \u2013 admittedly, under legal direction \u2013 to finally acknowledge that the passenger is booking direct with Uber rather than the driver. That has tax implications \u2013 pushing up fares in the UK, at a time when many customers may already be feeling the pinch. According to TfL, the VAT now payable on cab fares is a matter for HMRC and has no bearing on the licence. But Uber is, at least, quickly complying with a condition that will now apply to all. With revenues globally averaging nearly $2bn a month, and offshoots such as food delivery via Uber Eats growing profitable, London and its 50,000 Uber drivers may not be a pivotal part of the business. But global reputation still counts for something \u2013 and an undisputed licence would go some way to wipe the tarnish from the Uber brand.",
